            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nIt was nearly bed-time and when they awoke next morning land would be in\nsight. Dr. Macphail lit his pipe and, leaning over the rail, searched\nthe heavens for the Southern Cross. After two years at the front and a\nwound that had taken longer to heal than it should, he was glad to\nsettle down quietly at Apia for twelve months at least, and he felt\nalready better for the journey. Since some of the passengers were\nleaving the ship next day at Pago-Pago they had had a little dance that\nevening and in his ears hammered still the harsh notes of the mechanical\npiano. But the deck was quiet at last. A little way off he saw his wife\nin a long chair talking with the Davidsons, and he strolled over to her.\nWhen he sat down under the light and took off his hat you saw that he\nhad very red hair, with a bald patch on the crown, and the red, freckled\nskin which accompanies red hair; he was a man of forty, thin, with a\npinched face, precise and rather pedantic; and he spoke with a Scots\naccent in a very low, quiet voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBetween the Macphails and the Davidsons, who were missionaries, there\nhad arisen the intimacy of shipboard, which is due to propinquity rather\nthan to any community of taste. Their chief tie was the disapproval they\nshared of the men who spent their days and nights in the smoking-room\nplaying poker or bridge and drinking. Mrs. Macphail was not a little\nflattered to think that she and her husband were the only people on\nboard with whom the Davidsons were willing to associate, and even the\ndoctor, shy but no fool, half unconsciously acknowledged the compliment.\nIt was only because he was of an argumentative mind that in their cabin\nat night he permitted himself to carp.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Davidson was saying she didn't know how they'd have got through\nthe journey if it hadn't been for us,\" said Mrs. Macphail, as she neatly\nbrushed out her transformation. \"She said we were really the only people\non the ship they cared to know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shouldn't have thought a missionary was such a big bug that he could\nafford to put on frills.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not frills. I quite understand what she means. It wouldn't have\nbeen very nice for the Davidsons to have to mix with all that rough lot\nin the smoking-room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The founder of their religion wasn't so exclusive,\" said Dr. Macphail\nwith a chuckle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've asked you over and over again not to joke about religion,\"\nanswered his wife. \"I shouldn't like to have a nature like yours, Alec.\nYou never look for the best in people.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave her a sidelong glance with his pale, blue eyes, but did not\nreply. After many years of married life he had learned that it was more\nconducive to peace to leave his wife with the last word. He was\nundressed before she was, and climbing into the upper bunk he settled\ndown to read himself to sleep.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen he came on deck next morning they were close to land. He looked at\nit with greedy eyes. There was a thin strip of silver beach rising\nquickly to hills covered to the top with luxuriant vegetation. The\ncoconut trees, thick and green, came nearly to the water's edge, and\namong them you saw the grass houses of the Samoans; and here and there,\ngleaming white, a little church. Mrs. Davidson came and stood beside\nhim. She was dressed in black and wore round her neck a gold chain, from\nwhich dangled a small cross. She was a little woman, with brown, dull\nhair very elaborately arranged, and she had prominent blue eyes behind\ninvisible pince-nez. Her face was long, like a sheep's, but she gave no\nimpression of foolishness, rather of extreme alertness; she had the\nquick movements of a bird. The most remarkable thing about her was her\nvoice, high, metallic, and without inflection; it fell on the ear with a\nhard monotony, irritating to the nerves like the pitiless clamour of the\npneumatic drill.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This must seem like home to you,\" said Dr. Macphail, with his thin,\ndifficult smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ours are low islands, you know, not like these. Coral. These are\nvolcanic. We've got another ten days' journey to reach them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In these parts that's almost like being in the next street at home,\"\nsaid Dr. Macphail facetiously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, that's rather an exaggerated way of putting it, but one does look\nat distances differently in the South Seas. So far you're right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail sighed faintly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm glad we're not stationed here,\" she went on. \"They say this is a\nterribly difficult place to work in. The steamers' touching makes the\npeople unsettled; and then there's the naval station; that's bad for the\nnatives. In our district we don't have difficulties like that to contend\nwith. There are one or two traders, of course, but we take care to make\nthem behave, and if they don't we make the place so hot for them they're\nglad to go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFixing the glasses on her nose she looked at the green island with a\nruthless stare.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's almost a hopeless task for the missionaries here. I can never be\nsufficiently thankful to God that we are at least spared that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDavidson's district consisted of a group of islands to the North of\nSamoa; they were widely separated and he had frequently to go long\ndistances by canoe. At these times his wife remained at their\nheadquarters and managed the mission. Dr. Macphail felt his heart sink\nwhen he considered the efficiency with which she certainly managed it.\nShe spoke of the depravity of the natives in a voice which nothing could\nhush, but with a vehemently unctuous horror. Her sense of delicacy was\nsingular. Early in their acquaintance she had said to him:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, their marriage customs when we first settled in the islands\nwere so shocking that I couldn't possibly describe them to you. But I'll\ntell Mrs. Macphail and she'll tell you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he had seen his wife and Mrs. Davidson, their deck-chairs close\ntogether, in earnest conversation for about two hours. As he walked past\nthem backwards and forwards for the sake of exercise, he had heard Mrs.\nDavidson's agitated whisper, like the distant flow of a mountain\ntorrent, and he saw by his wife's open mouth and pale face that she was\nenjoying an alarming experience. At night in their cabin she repeated to\nhim with bated breath all she had heard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what did I say to you?\" cried Mrs. Davidson, exultant next\nmorning. \"Did you ever hear anything more dreadful? You don't wonder\nthat I couldn't tell you myself, do you? Even though you are a doctor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Davidson scanned his face. She had a dramatic eagerness to see that\nshe had achieved the desired effect.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can you wonder that when we first went there our hearts sank? You'll\nhardly believe me when I tell you it was impossible to find a single\ngood girl in any of the villages.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe used the word <i>good</i> in a severely technical manner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Davidson and I talked it over, and we made up our minds the first\nthing to do was to put down the dancing. The natives were crazy about\ndancing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was not averse to it myself when I was a young man,\" said Dr.\nMacphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guessed as much when I heard you ask Mrs. Macphail to have a turn\nwith you last night. I don't think there's any real harm if a man dances\nwith his wife, but I was relieved that she wouldn't. Under the\ncircumstances I thought it better that we should keep ourselves to\nourselves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Under what circumstances?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Davidson gave him a quick look through her pince-nez, but did not\nanswer his question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But among white people it's not quite the same,\" she went on, \"though I\nmust say I agree with Mr. Davidson, who says he can't understand how a\nhusband can stand by and see his wife in another man's arms, and as far\nas I'm concerned I've never danced a step since I married. But the\nnative dancing is quite another matter. It's not only immoral in itself,\nbut it distinctly leads to immorality. However, I'm thankful to God that\nwe stamped it out, and I don't think I'm wrong in saying that no one has\ndanced in our district for eight years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut now they came to the mouth of the harbour and Mrs. Macphail joined\nthem. The ship turned sharply and steamed slowly in. It was a great\nland-locked harbour big enough to hold a fleet of battleships; and all\naround it rose, high and steep, the green hills. Near the entrance,\ngetting such breeze as blew from the sea, stood the governor's house in\na garden. The Stars and Stripes dangled languidly from a flagstaff. They\npassed two or three trim bungalows, and a tennis-court, and then they\ncame to the quay with its warehouses. Mrs. Davidson pointed out the\nschooner, moored two or three hundred yards from the side, which was to\ntake them to Apia. There was a crowd of eager, noisy, and good-humoured\nnatives come from all parts of the island, some from curiosity, others\nto barter with the travellers on their way to Sydney; and they brought\npineapples and huge bunches of bananas, tapa cloths, necklaces of shells\nor sharks' teeth, <i>kava</i>-bowls, and models of war canoes. American\nsailors, neat and trim, clean-shaven and frank of face, sauntered among\nthem, and there was a little group of officials. While their luggage was\nbeing landed the Macphails and Mrs. Davidson watched the crowd. Dr.\nMacphail looked at the yaws from which most of the children and the\nyoung boys seemed to suffer, disfiguring sores, like torpid ulcers, and\nhis professional eyes glistened when he saw for the first time in his\nexperience cases of elephantiasis, men going about with a huge, heavy\narm or dragging along a grossly disfigured leg. Men and women wore the\nlava-lava.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a very indecent costume,\" said Mrs. Davidson. \"Mr. Davidson thinks\nit should be prohibited by law. How can you expect people to be moral\nwhen they wear nothing but a strip of red cotton round their loins?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's suitable enough to the climate,\" said the doctor, wiping the sweat\noff his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow that they were on land the heat, though it was so early in the\nmorning, was already oppressive. Closed in by its hills, not a breath of\nair came in to Pago-Pago.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In our islands,\" Mrs. Davidson went on in her high-pitched tones,\n\"we've practically eradicated the lava-lava. A few old men still\ncontinue to wear it, but that's all. The women have all taken to the\nMother Hubbard, and the men wear trousers and singlets. At the beginning\nof our stay Mr. Davidson said in one of his reports: the inhabitants of\nthese islands will never be thoroughly Christianised till every boy of\nmore than ten years is made to wear a pair of trousers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Mrs. Davidson had given two or three of her birdlike glances at\nheavy grey clouds that came floating over the mouth of the harbour. A\nfew drops began to fall.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'd better take shelter,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey made their way with all the crowd to a great shed of corrugated\niron, and the rain began to fall in torrents. They stood there for some\ntime and then were joined by Mr. Davidson. He had been polite enough to\nthe Macphails during the journey, but he had not his wife's sociability,\nand had spent much of his time reading. He was a silent, rather sullen\nman, and you felt that his affability was a duty that he imposed upon\nhimself Christianly; he was by nature reserved and even morose. His\nappearance was singular. He was very tall and thin, with long limbs\nloosely jointed; hollow cheeks and curiously high cheek-bones; he had so\ncadaverous an air that it surprised you to notice how full and sensual\nwere his lips. He wore his hair very long. His dark eyes, set deep in\ntheir sockets, were large and tragic; and his hands with their big, long\nfingers, were finely shaped; they gave him a look of great strength. But\nthe most striking thing about him was the feeling he gave you of\nsuppressed fire. It was impressive and vaguely troubling. He was not a\nman with whom any intimacy was possible.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe brought now unwelcome news. There was an epidemic of measles, a\nserious and often fatal disease among the Kanakas, on the island, and a\ncase had developed among the crew of the schooner which was to take them\non their journey. The sick man had been brought ashore and put in\nhospital on the quarantine station, but telegraphic instructions had\nbeen sent from Apia to say that the schooner would not be allowed to\nenter the harbour till it was certain no other member of the crew was\naffected.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It means we shall have to stay here for ten days at least.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I'm urgently needed at Apia,\" said Dr. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That can't be helped. If no more cases develop on board, the schooner\nwill be allowed to sail with white passengers, but all native traffic is\nprohibited for three months.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is there a hotel here?\" asked Mrs. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDavidson gave a low chuckle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What shall we do then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've been talking to the governor. There's a trader along the front who\nhas rooms that he rents, and my proposition is that as soon as the rain\nlets up we should go along there and see what we can do. Don't expect\ncomfort. You've just got to be thankful if we get a bed to sleep on and\na roof over our heads.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the rain showed no signs of stopping, and at length with umbrellas\nand waterproofs they set out. There was no town, but merely a group of\nofficial buildings, a store or two, and at the back, among the coconut\ntrees and plantains, a few native dwellings. The house they sought was\nabout five minutes' walk from the wharf. It was a frame house of two\nstoreys, with broad verandahs on both floors and a roof of corrugated\niron. The owner was a half-caste named Horn, with a native wife\nsurrounded by little brown children, and on the ground-floor he had a\nstore where he sold canned goods and cottons. The rooms he showed them\nwere almost bare of furniture. In the Macphails' there was nothing but a\npoor, worn bed with a ragged mosquito net, a rickety chair, and a\nwashstand. They looked round with dismay. The rain poured down without\nceasing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not going to unpack more than we actually need,\" said Mrs.\nMacphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Davidson came into the room as she was unlocking a portmanteau. She\nwas very brisk and alert. The cheerless surroundings had no effect on\nher.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you'll take my advice you'll get a needle and cotton and start right\nin to mend the mosquito net,\" she said, \"or you'll not be able to get a\nwink of sleep to-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will they be very bad?\" asked Dr. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is the season for them. When you're asked to a party at Government\nHouse at Apia you'll notice that all the ladies are given a pillowslip\nto put their--their lower extremities in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish the rain would stop for a moment,\" said Mrs. Macphail. \"I could\ntry to make the place comfortable with more heart if the sun were\nshining.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, if you wait for that, you'll wait a long time. Pago-Pago is about\nthe rainiest place in the Pacific. You see, the hills, and that bay,\nthey attract the water, and one expects rain at this time of year\nanyway.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked from Macphail to his wife, standing helplessly in different\nparts of the room, like lost souls, and she pursed her lips. She saw\nthat she must take them in hand. Feckless people like that made her\nimpatient, but her hands itched to put everything in the order which\ncame so naturally to her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Here, you give me a needle and cotton and I'll mend that net of yours,\nwhile you go on with your unpacking. Dinner's at one. Dr. Macphail,\nyou'd better go down to the wharf and see that your heavy luggage has\nbeen put in a dry place. You know what these natives are, they're quite\ncapable of storing it where the rain will beat in on it all the time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor put on his waterproof again and went downstairs. At the door\nMr. Horn was standing in conversation with the quartermaster of the ship\nthey had just arrived in and a second-class passenger whom Dr. Macphail\nhad seen several times on board. The quartermaster, a little, shrivelled\nman, extremely dirty, nodded to him as he passed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is a bad job about the measles, doc,\" he said. \"I see you've fixed\nyourself up already.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail thought he was rather familiar, but he was a timid man and\nhe did not take offence easily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, we've got a room upstairs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Miss Thompson was sailing with you to Apia, so I've brought her along\nhere.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe quartermaster pointed with his thumb to the woman standing by his\nside. She was twenty-seven perhaps, plump, and in a coarse fashion\npretty. She wore a white dress and a large white hat. Her fat calves in\nwhite cotton stockings bulged over the tops of long white boots in glacé\nkid. She gave Macphail an ingratiating smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The feller's tryin' to soak me a dollar and a half a day for the\nmeanest-sized room,\" she said in a hoarse voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I tell you she's a friend of mine, Jo,\" said the quartermaster. \"She\ncan't pay more than a dollar, and you've sure got to take her for that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe trader was fat and smooth and quietly smiling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if you put it like that, Mr. Swan, I'll see what I can do about\nit. I'll talk to Mrs. Horn and if we think we can make a reduction we\nwill.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't try to pull that stuff with me,\" said Miss Thompson. \"We'll\nsettle this right now. You get a dollar a day for the room and not one\nbean more.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail smiled. He admired the effrontery with which she bargained.\nHe was the sort of man who always paid what he was asked. He preferred\nto be over-charged than to haggle. The trader sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, to oblige Mr. Swan I'll take it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's the goods,\" said Miss Thompson. \"Come right in and have a shot\nof hooch. I've got some real good rye in that grip if you'll bring it\nalong, Mr. Swan. You come along too, doctor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I don't think I will, thank you,\" he answered. \"I'm just going down\nto see that our luggage is all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe stepped out into the rain. It swept in from the opening of the\nharbour in sheets and the opposite shore was all blurred. He passed two\nor three natives clad in nothing but the lava-lava, with huge umbrellas\nover them. They walked finely, with leisurely movements, very upright;\nand they smiled and greeted him in a strange tongue as they went by.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was nearly dinner-time when he got back, and their meal was laid in\nthe trader's parlour. It was a room designed not to live in but for\npurposes of prestige, and it had a musty, melancholy air. A suite of\nstamped plush was arranged neatly round the walls, and from the middle\nof the ceiling, protected from the flies by yellow tissue-paper, hung a\ngilt chandelier. Davidson did not come.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know he went to call on the governor,\" said Mrs. Davidson, \"and I\nguess he's kept him to dinner.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA little native girl brought them a dish of Hamburger steak, and after a\nwhile the trader came up to see that they had everything they wanted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see we have a fellow lodger, Mr. Horn,\" said Dr. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's taken a room, that's all,\" answered the trader. \"She's getting\nher own board.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at the two ladies with an obsequious air.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I put her downstairs so she shouldn't be in the way. She won't be any\ntrouble to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it someone who was on the boat?\" asked Mrs. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, ma'am, she was in the second cabin. She was going to Apia. She has\na position as cashier waiting for her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen the trader was gone Macphail said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shouldn't think she'd find it exactly cheerful having her meals in\nher room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If she was in the second cabin I guess she'd rather,\" answered Mrs.\nDavidson. \"I don't exactly know who it can be.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I happened to be there when the quartermaster brought her along. Her\nname's Thompson.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not the woman who was dancing with the quartermaster last night?\"\nasked Mrs. Davidson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's who it must be,\" said Mrs. Macphail. \"I wondered at the time\nwhat she was. She looked rather fast to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not good style at all,\" said Mrs. Davidson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey began to talk of other things, and after dinner, tired with their\nearly rise, they separated and slept. When they awoke, though the sky\nwas still grey and the clouds hung low, it was not raining and they went\nfor a walk on the high road which the Americans had built along the bay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn their return they found that Davidson had just come in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We may be here for a fortnight,\" he said irritably. \"I've argued it out\nwith the governor, but he says there is nothing to be done.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Davidson's just longing to get back to his work,\" said his wife,\nwith an anxious glance at him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We've been away for a year,\" he said, walking up and down the verandah.\n\"The mission has been in charge of native missionaries and I'm terribly\nnervous that they've let things slide. They're good men, I'm not saying\na word against them, God-fearing, devout, and truly Christian men--their\nChristianity would put many so-called Christians at home to the\nblush--but they're pitifully lacking in energy. They can make a stand\nonce, they can make a stand twice, but they can't make a stand all the\ntime. If you leave a mission in charge of a native missionary, no matter\nhow trustworthy he seems, in course of time you'll find he's let abuses\ncreep in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Davidson stood still. With his tall, spare form, and his great eyes\nflashing out of his pale face, he was an impressive figure. His\nsincerity was obvious in the fire of his gestures and in his deep,\nringing voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I expect to have my work cut out for me. I shall act and I shall act\npromptly. If the tree is rotten it shall be cut down and cast into the\nflames.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd in the evening after the high-tea which was their last meal, while\nthey sat in the stiff parlour, the ladies working and Dr. Macphail\nsmoking his pipe, the missionary told them of his work in the islands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When we went there they had no sense of sin at all,\" he said. \"They\nbroke the commandments one after the other and never knew they were\ndoing wrong. And I think that was the most difficult part of my work, to\ninstil into the natives the sense of sin.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Macphails knew already that Davidson had worked in the Solomons for\nfive years before he met his wife. She had been a missionary in China,\nand they had become acquainted in Boston, where they were both spending\npart of their leave to attend a missionary congress. On their marriage\nthey had been appointed to the islands in which they had laboured ever\nsince.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the course of all the conversations they had had with Mr. Davidson\none thing had shone out clearly and that was the man's unflinching\ncourage. He was a medical missionary, and he was liable to be called at\nany time to one or other of the islands in the group. Even the whaleboat\nis not so very safe a conveyance in the stormy Pacific of the wet\nseason, but often he would be sent for in a canoe, and then the danger\nwas great. In cases of illness or accident he never hesitated. A dozen\ntimes he had spent the whole night baling for his life, and more than\nonce Mrs. Davidson had given him up for lost.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd beg him not to go sometimes,\" she said, \"or at least to wait till\nthe weather was more settled, but he'd never listen. He's obstinate, and\nwhen he's once made up his mind, nothing can move him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How can I ask the natives to put their trust in the Lord if I am afraid\nto do so myself?\" cried Davidson. \"And I'm not, I'm not. They know that\nif they send for me in their trouble I'll come if it's humanly possible.\nAnd do you think the Lord is going to abandon me when I am on his\nbusiness? The wind blows at his bidding and the waves toss and rage at\nhis word.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail was a timid man. He had never been able to get used to the\nhurtling of the shells over the trenches, and when he was operating in\nan advanced dressing-station the sweat poured from his brow and dimmed\nhis spectacles in the effort he made to control his unsteady hand. He\nshuddered a little as he looked at the missionary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish I could say that I've never been afraid,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish you could say that you believed in God,\" retorted the other.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut for some reason, that evening the missionary's thoughts travelled\nback to the early days he and his wife had spent on the islands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sometimes Mrs. Davidson and I would look at one another and the tears\nwould stream down our cheeks. We worked without ceasing, day and night,\nand we seemed to make no progress. I don't know what I should have done\nwithout her then. When I felt my heart sink, when I was very near\ndespair, she gave me courage and hope.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Davidson looked down at her work, and a slight colour rose to her\nthin cheeks. Her hands trembled a little. She did not trust herself to\nspeak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We had no one to help us. We were alone, thousands of miles from any of\nour own people, surrounded by darkness. When I was broken and weary she\nwould put her work aside and take the Bible and read to me till peace\ncame and settled upon me like sleep upon the eyelids of a child, and\nwhen at last she closed the book she'd say: 'We'll save them in spite of\nthemselves.' And I felt strong again in the Lord, and I answered: 'Yes,\nwith God's help I'll save them. I must save them.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe came over to the table and stood in front of it as though it were a\nlectern.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see, they were so naturally depraved that they couldn't be brought\nto see their wickedness. We had to make sins out of what they thought\nwere natural actions. We had to make it a sin, not only to commit\nadultery and to lie and thieve, but to expose their bodies, and to dance\nand not to come to church. I made it a sin for a girl to show her bosom\nand a sin for a man not to wear trousers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How?\" asked Dr. Macphail, not without surprise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I instituted fines. Obviously the only way to make people realise that\nan action is sinful is to punish them if they commit it. I fined them if\nthey didn't come to church, and I fined them if they danced. I fined\nthem if they were improperly dressed. I had a tariff, and every sin had\nto be paid for either in money or work. And at last I made them\nunderstand.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But did they never refuse to pay?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How could they?\" asked the missionary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be a brave man who tried to stand up against Mr. Davidson,\"\nsaid his wife, tightening her lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail looked at Davidson with troubled eyes. What he heard\nshocked him, but he hesitated to express his disapproval.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must remember that in the last resort I could expel them from their\nchurch membership.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did they mind that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDavidson smiled a little and gently rubbed his hands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They couldn't sell their copra. When the men fished they got no share\nof the catch. It meant something very like starvation. Yes, they minded\nquite a lot.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell him about Fred Ohlson,\" said Mrs. Davidson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe missionary fixed his fiery eyes on Dr. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fred Ohlson was a Danish trader who had been in the islands a good many\nyears. He was a pretty rich man as traders go and he wasn't very pleased\nwhen we came. You see, he'd had things very much his own way. He paid\nthe natives what he liked for their copra, and he paid in goods and\nwhisky. He had a native wife, but he was flagrantly unfaithful to her.\nHe was a drunkard. I gave him a chance to mend his ways, but he wouldn't\ntake it. He laughed at me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDavidson's voice fell to a deep bass as he said the last words, and he\nwas silent for a minute or two. The silence was heavy with menace.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In two years he was a ruined man. He'd lost everything he'd saved in a\nquarter of a century. I broke him, and at last he was forced to come to\nme like a beggar and beseech me to give him a passage back to Sydney.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish you could have seen him when he came to see Mr. Davidson,\" said\nthe missionary's wife. \"He had been a fine, powerful man, with a lot of\nfat on him, and he had a great big voice, but now he was half the size,\nand he was shaking all over. He'd suddenly become an old man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith abstracted gaze Davidson looked out into the night. The rain was\nfalling again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSuddenly from below came a sound, and Davidson turned and looked\nquestioningly at his wife. It was the sound of a gramophone, harsh and\nloud, wheezing out a syncopated tune.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's that?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Davidson fixed her pince-nez more firmly on her nose.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One of the second-class passengers has a room in the house. I guess it\ncomes from there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey listened in silence, and presently they heard the sound of dancing.\nThen the music stopped, and they heard the popping of corks and voices\nraised in animated conversation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I daresay she's giving a farewell party to her friends on board,\" said\nDr. Macphail. \"The ship sails at twelve, doesn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDavidson made no remark, but he looked at his watch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you ready?\" he asked his wife.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe got up and folded her work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I guess I am,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's early to go to bed yet, isn't it?\" said the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We have a good deal of reading to do,\" explained Mrs. Davidson.\n\"Wherever we are, we read a chapter of the Bible before retiring for the\nnight and we study it with the commentaries, you know, and discuss it\nthoroughly. It's a wonderful training for the mind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe two couples bade one another good-night. Dr. and Mrs. Macphail were\nleft alone. For two or three minutes they did not speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I'll go and fetch the cards,\" the doctor said at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Macphail looked at him doubtfully. Her conversation with the\nDavidsons had left her a little uneasy, but she did not like to say that\nshe thought they had better not play cards when the Davidsons might come\nin at any moment. Dr. Macphail brought them and she watched him, though\nwith a vague sense of guilt, while he laid out his patience. Below the\nsound of revelry continued.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was fine enough next day, and the Macphails, condemned to spend a\nfortnight of idleness at Pago-Pago, set about making the best of things.\nThey went down to the quay and got out of their boxes a number of books.\nThe doctor called on the chief surgeon of the naval hospital and went\nround the beds with him. They left cards on the governor. They passed\nMiss Thompson on the road. The doctor took off his hat, and she gave him\na \"Good-morning, doc,\" in a loud, cheerful voice. She was dressed as on\nthe day before, in a white frock, and her shiny white boots with their\nhigh heels, her fat legs bulging over the tops of them, were strange\nthings on that exotic scene.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think she's very suitably dressed, I must say,\" said Mrs.\nMacphail. \"She looks extremely common to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen they got back to their house, she was on the verandah playing with\none of the trader's dark children.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Say a word to her,\" Dr. Macphail whispered to his wife. \"She's all\nalone here, and it seems rather unkind to ignore her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Macphail was shy, but she was in the habit of doing what her\nhusband bade her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think we're fellow lodgers here,\" she said, rather foolishly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Terrible, ain't it, bein' cooped up in a one-horse burg like this?\"\nanswered Miss Thompson. \"And they tell me I'm lucky to have gotten a\nroom. I don't see myself livin' in a native house, and that's what some\nhave to do. I don't know why they don't have a hotel.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey exchanged a few more words. Miss Thompson, loud-voiced and\ngarrulous, was evidently quite willing to gossip, but Mrs. Macphail had\na poor stock of small-talk and presently she said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I think we must go upstairs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the evening when they sat down to their high-tea Davidson on coming\nin said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see that woman downstairs has a couple of sailors sitting there. I\nwonder how she's gotten acquainted with them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She can't be very particular,\" said Mrs. Davidson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were all rather tired after the idle, aimless day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If there's going to be a fortnight of this I don't know what we shall\nfeel like at the end of it,\" said Dr. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The only thing to do is to portion out the day to different\nactivities,\" answered the missionary. \"I shall set aside a certain\nnumber of hours to study and a certain number to exercise, rain or\nfine--in the wet season you can't afford to pay any attention to the\nrain--and a certain number to recreation.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail looked at his companion with misgiving. Davidson's\nprogramme oppressed him. They were eating Hamburger steak again. It\nseemed the only dish the cook knew how to make. Then below the\ngramophone began. Davidson started nervously when he heard it, but said\nnothing. Men's voices floated up. Miss Thompson's guests were joining in\na well-known song and presently they heard her voice too, hoarse and\nloud. There was a good deal of shouting and laughing. The four people\nupstairs, trying to make conversation, listened despite themselves to\nthe clink of glasses and the scrape of chairs. More people had evidently\ncome. Miss Thompson was giving a party.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder how she gets them all in,\" said Mrs. Macphail suddenly\nbreaking into a medical conversation between the missionary and her\nhusband.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt showed whither her thoughts were wandering. The twitch of Davidson's\nface proved that, though he spoke of scientific things, his mind was\nbusy in the same direction. Suddenly, while the doctor was giving some\nexperience of practice on the Flanders front, rather prosily, he sprang\nto his feet with a cry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's the matter, Alfred?\" asked Mrs. Davidson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course! It never occurred to me. She's out of Iwelei.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She can't be.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She came on board at Honolulu. It's obvious. And she's carrying on her\ntrade here. Here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe uttered the last word with a passion of indignation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's Iwelei?\" asked Mrs. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned his gloomy eyes on her and his voice trembled with horror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The plague spot of Honolulu. The Red Light district. It was a blot on\nour civilisation.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIwelei was on the edge of the city. You went down side streets by the\nharbour, in the darkness, across a rickety bridge, till you came to a\ndeserted road, all ruts and holes, and then suddenly you came out into\nthe light. There was parking room for motors on each side of the road,\nand there were saloons, tawdry and bright, each one noisy with its\nmechanical piano, and there were barbers' shops and tobacconists. There\nwas a stir in the air and a sense of expectant gaiety. You turned down a\nnarrow alley, either to the right or to the left, for the road divided\nIwelei into two parts, and you found yourself in the district. There\nwere rows of little bungalows, trim and neatly painted in green, and the\npathway between them was broad and straight. It was laid out like a\ngarden-city. In its respectable regularity, its order and spruceness, it\ngave an impression of sardonic horror; for never can the search for love\nhave been so systematised and ordered. The pathways were lit by a rare\nlamp, but they would have been dark except for the lights that came from\nthe open windows of the bungalows. Men wandered about, looking at the\nwomen who sat at their windows, reading or sewing, for the most part\ntaking no notice of the passers-by; and like the women they were of all\nnationalities. There were Americans, sailors from the ships in port,\nenlisted men off the gunboats, sombrely drunk, and soldiers from the\nregiments, white and black, quartered on the island; there were\nJapanese, walking in twos and threes; Hawaiians, Chinese in long robes,\nand Filipinos in preposterous hats. They were silent and as it were\noppressed. Desire is sad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was the most crying scandal of the Pacific,\" exclaimed Davidson\nvehemently. \"The missionaries had been agitating against it for years,\nand at last the local press took it up. The police refused to stir. You\nknow their argument. They say that vice is inevitable and consequently\nthe best thing is to localise and control it. The truth is, they were\npaid. Paid. They were paid by the saloon-keepers, paid by the bullies,\npaid by the women themselves. At last they were forced to move.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I read about it in the papers that came on board in Honolulu,\" said Dr.\nMacphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Iwelei, with its sin and shame, ceased to exist on the very day we\narrived. The whole population was brought before the justices. I don't\nknow why I didn't understand at once what that woman was.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now you come to speak of it,\" said Mrs. Macphail, \"I remember seeing\nher come on board only a few minutes before the boat sailed. I remember\nthinking at the time she was cutting it rather fine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How dare she come here!\" cried Davidson indignantly. \"I'm not going to\nallow it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe strode towards the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you expect me to do? I'm going to stop it. I'm not going to\nhave this house turned into--into...\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sought for a word that should not offend the ladies' ears. His eyes\nwere flashing and his pale face was paler still in his emotion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It sounds as though there were three or four men down there,\" said the\ndoctor. \"Don't you think it's rather rash to go in just now?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe missionary gave him a contemptuous look and without a word flung out\nof the room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know Mr. Davidson very little if you think the fear of personal\ndanger can stop him in the performance of his duty,\" said his wife.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe sat with her hands nervously clasped, a spot of colour on her high\ncheek-bones, listening to what was about to happen below. They all\nlistened. They heard him clatter down the wooden stairs and throw open\nthe door. The singing stopped suddenly, but the gramophone continued to\nbray out its vulgar tune. They heard Davidson's voice and then the noise\nof something heavy falling. The music stopped. He had hurled the\ngramophone on the floor. Then again they heard Davidson's voice, they\ncould not make out the words, then Miss Thompson's, loud and shrill,\nthen a confused clamour as though several people were shouting together\nat the top of their lungs. Mrs. Davidson gave a little gasp, and she\nclenched her hands more tightly. Dr. Macphail looked uncertainly from\nher to his wife. He did not want to go down, but he wondered if they\nexpected him to. Then there was something that sounded like a scuffle.\nThe noise now was more distinct. It might be that Davidson was being\nthrown out of the room. The door was slammed. There was a moment's\nsilence and they heard Davidson come up the stairs again. He went to his\nroom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I'll go to him,\" said Mrs. Davidson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe got up and went out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you want me, just call,\" said Mrs. Macphail, and then when the other\nwas gone: \"I hope he isn't hurt.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why couldn't he mind his own business?\" said Dr. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey sat in silence for a minute or two and then they both started, for\nthe gramophone began to play once more, defiantly, and mocking voices\nshouted hoarsely the words of an obscene song.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext day Mrs. Davidson was pale and tired. She complained of headache,\nand she looked old and wizened. She told Mrs. Macphail that the\nmissionary had not slept at all; he had passed the night in a state of\nfrightful agitation and at five had got up and gone out. A glass of beer\nhad been thrown over him and his clothes were stained and stinking. But\na sombre fire glowed in Mrs. Davidson's eyes when she spoke of Miss\nThompson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She'll bitterly rue the day when she flouted Mr. Davidson,\" she said.\n\"Mr. Davidson has a wonderful heart and no one who is in trouble has\never gone to him without being comforted, but he has no mercy for sin,\nand when his righteous wrath is excited he's terrible.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, what will he do?\" asked Mrs. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know, but I wouldn't stand in that creature's shoes for\nanything in the world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Macphail shuddered. There was something positively alarming in the\ntriumphant assurance of the little woman's manner. They were going out\ntogether that morning, and they went down the stairs side by side. Miss\nThompson's door was open, and they saw her in a bedraggled\ndressing-gown, cooking something in a chafing-dish.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-morning,\" she called. \"Is Mr. Davidson better this morning?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey passed her in silence, with their noses in the air, as if she did\nnot exist. They flushed, however, when she burst into a shout of\nderisive laughter. Mrs. Davidson turned on her suddenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you dare to speak to me,\" she screamed. \"If you insult me I shall\nhave you turned out of here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Say, did I ask Mr. Davidson to visit with me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't answer her,\" whispered Mrs. Macphail hurriedly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey walked on till they were out of earshot.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's brazen, brazen,\" burst from Mrs. Davidson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer anger almost suffocated her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd on their way home they met her strolling towards the quay. She had\nall her finery on. Her great white hat with its vulgar, showy flowers\nwas an affront. She called out cheerily to them as she went by, and a\ncouple of American sailors who were standing there grinned as the ladies\nset their faces to an icy stare. They got in just before the rain began\nto fall again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess she'll get her fine clothes spoilt,\" said Mrs. Davidson with a\nbitter sneer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDavidson did not come in till they were half-way through dinner. He was\nwet through, but he would not change. He sat, morose and silent,\nrefusing to eat more than a mouthful, and he stared at the slanting\nrain. When Mrs. Davidson told him of their two encounters with Miss\nThompson he did not answer. His deepening frown alone showed that he had\nheard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you think we ought to make Mr. Horn turn her out of here?\" asked\nMrs. Davidson. \"We can't allow her to insult us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There doesn't seem to be any other place for her to go,\" said Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She can live with one of the natives.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In weather like this a native hut must be a rather uncomfortable place\nto live in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I lived in one for years,\" said the missionary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen the little native girl brought in the fried bananas which formed\nthe sweet they had every day, Davidson turned to her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ask Miss Thompson when it would be convenient for me to see her,\" he\nsaid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe girl nodded shyly and went out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you want to see her for, Alfred?\" asked his wife.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's my duty to see her. I won't act till I've given her every chance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't know what she is. She'll insult you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let her insult me. Let her spit on me. She has an immortal soul, and I\nmust do all that is in my power to save it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Davidson's ears rang still with the harlot's mocking laughter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's gone too far.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Too far for the mercy of God?\" His eyes lit up suddenly and his voice\ngrew mellow and soft. \"Never. The sinner may be deeper in sin than the\ndepth of hell itself, but the love of the Lord Jesus can reach him\nstill.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe girl came back with the message.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Miss Thompson's compliments and as long as Rev. Davidson don't come in\nbusiness hours she'll be glad to see him any time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe party received it in stony silence, and Dr. Macphail quickly effaced\nfrom his lips the smile which had come upon them. He knew his wife would\nbe vexed with him if he found Miss Thompson's effrontery amusing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey finished the meal in silence. When it was over the two ladies got\nup and took their work, Mrs. Macphail was making another of the\ninnumerable comforters which she had turned out since the beginning of\nthe war, and the doctor lit his pipe. But Davidson remained in his chair\nand with abstracted eyes stared at the table. At last he got up and\nwithout a word went out of the room. They heard him go down and they\nheard Miss Thompson's defiant \"Come in\" when he knocked at the door. He\nremained with her for an hour. And Dr. Macphail watched the rain. It was\nbeginning to get on his nerves. It was not like our soft English rain\nthat drops gently on the earth; it was unmerciful and somehow terrible;\nyou felt in it the malignancy of the primitive powers of nature. It did\nnot pour, it flowed. It was like a deluge from heaven, and it rattled on\nthe roof of corrugated iron with a steady persistence that was\nmaddening. It seemed to have a fury of its own. And sometimes you felt\nthat you must scream if it did not stop, and then suddenly you felt\npowerless, as though your bones had suddenly become soft; and you were\nmiserable and hopeless.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMacphail turned his head when the missionary came back. The two women\nlooked up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've given her every chance. I have exhorted her to repent. She is an\nevil woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe paused, and Dr. Macphail saw his eyes darken and his pale face grow\nhard and stern.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now I shall take the whips with which the Lord Jesus drove the usurers\nand the money-changers out of the Temple of the Most High.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe walked up and down the room. His mouth was close-set, and his black\nbrows were frowning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If she fled to the uttermost parts of the earth I should pursue her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith a sudden movement he turned round and strode out of the room. They\nheard him go downstairs again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is he going to do?\" asked Mrs. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know.\" Mrs. Davidson took off her pince-nez and wiped them.\n\"When he is on the Lord's work I never ask him questions.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe sighed a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is the matter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He'll wear himself out. He doesn't know what it is to spare himself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail learnt the first results of the missionary's activity from\nthe half-caste trader in whose house they lodged. He stopped the doctor\nwhen he passed the store and came out to speak to him on the stoop. His\nfat face was worried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Rev. Davidson has been at me for letting Miss Thompson have a room\nhere,\" he said, \"but I didn't know what she was when I rented it to her.\nWhen people come and ask if I can rent them a room all I want to know is\nif they've the money to pay for it. And she paid me for hers a week in\nadvance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail did not want to commit himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When all's said and done it's your house. We're very much obliged to\nyou for taking us in at all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHorn looked at him doubtfully. He was not certain yet how definitely\nMacphail stood on the missionary's side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The missionaries are in with one another,\" he said, hesitatingly. \"If\nthey get it in for a trader he may just as well shut up his store and\nquit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did he want you to turn her out?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, he said so long as she behaved herself he couldn't ask me to do\nthat. He said he wanted to be just to me. I promised she shouldn't have\nno more visitors. I've just been and told her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did she take it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She gave me Hell.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe trader squirmed in his old ducks. He had found Miss Thompson a rough\ncustomer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, well, I daresay she'll get out. I don't suppose she wants to stay\nhere if she can't have anyone in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's nowhere she can go, only a native house, and no native'll take\nher now, not now that the missionaries have got their knife in her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail looked at the falling rain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I don't suppose it's any good waiting for it to clear up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the evening when they sat in the parlour Davidson talked to them of\nhis early days at college. He had had no means and had worked his way\nthrough by doing odd jobs during the vacations. There was silence\ndownstairs. Miss Thompson was sitting in her little room alone. But\nsuddenly the gramophone began to play. She had set it on in defiance, to\ncheat her loneliness, but there was no one to sing, and it had a\nmelancholy note. It was like a cry for help. Davidson took no notice. He\nwas in the middle of a long anecdote and without change of expression\nwent on. The gramophone continued. Miss Thompson put on one reel after\nanother. It looked as though the silence of the night were getting on\nher nerves. It was breathless and sultry. When the Macphails went to bed\nthey could not sleep. They lay side by side with their eyes wide open,\nlistening to the cruel singing of the mosquitoes outside their curtain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's that?\" whispered Mrs. Macphail at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey heard a voice, Davidson's voice, through the wooden partition. It\nwent on with a monotonous, earnest insistence. He was praying aloud. He\nwas praying for the soul of Miss Thompson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTwo or three days went by. Now when they passed Miss Thompson on the\nroad she did not greet them with ironic cordiality or smile; she passed\nwith her nose in the air, a sulky look on her painted face, frowning, as\nthough she did not see them. The trader told Macphail that she had tried\nto get lodging elsewhere, but had failed. In the evening she played\nthrough the various reels of her gramophone, but the pretence of mirth\nwas obvious now. The ragtime had a cracked, heartbroken rhythm as though\nit were a one-step of despair. When she began to play on Sunday Davidson\nsent Horn to beg her to stop at once since it was the Lord's day. The\nreel was taken off and the house was silent except for the steady\npattering of the rain on the iron roof.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think she's getting a bit worked up,\" said the trader next day to\nMacphail. \"She don't know what Mr. Davidson's up to and it makes her\nscared.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMacphail had caught a glimpse of her that morning and it struck him that\nher arrogant expression had changed. There was in her face a hunted\nlook. The half-caste gave him a sidelong glance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you don't know what Mr. Davidson is doing about it?\" he\nhazarded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I don't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was singular that Horn should ask him that question, for he also had\nthe idea that the missionary was mysteriously at work. He had an\nimpression that he was weaving a net around the woman, carefully,\nsystematically, and suddenly, when everything was ready would pull the\nstrings tight.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He told me to tell her,\" said the trader, \"that if at any time she\nwanted him she only had to send and he'd come.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did she say when you told her that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She didn't say nothing. I didn't stop. I just said what he said I was\nto and then I beat it. I thought she might be going to start weepin'.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have no doubt the loneliness is getting on her nerves,\" said the\ndoctor. \"And the rain--that's enough to make anyone jumpy,\" he continued\nirritably. \"Doesn't it ever stop in this confounded place?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It goes on pretty steady in the rainy season. We have three hundred\ninches in the year. You see, it's the shape of the bay. It seems to\nattract the rain from all over the Pacific.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damn the shape of the bay,\" said the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe scratched his mosquito bites. He felt very short-tempered. When the\nrain stopped and the sun shone, it was like a hot-house, seething,\nhumid, sultry, breathless, and you had a strange feeling that everything\nwas growing with a savage violence. The natives, blithe and childlike by\nreputation, seemed then, with their tattooing and their dyed hair, to\nhave something sinister in their appearance; and when they pattered\nalong at your heels with their naked feet you looked back instinctively.\nYou felt they might at any moment come behind you swiftly and thrust a\nlong knife between your shoulder-blades. You could not tell what dark\nthoughts lurked behind their wide-set eyes. They had a little the look\nof ancient Egyptians painted on a temple wall, and there was about them\nthe terror of what is immeasurably old.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe missionary came and went. He was busy, but the Macphails did not\nknow what he was doing. Horn told the doctor that he saw the governor\nevery day, and once Davidson mentioned him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He looks as if he had plenty of determination,\" he said, \"but when you\ncome down to brass-tacks he has no backbone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose that means he won't do exactly what you want,\" suggested the\ndoctor facetiously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe missionary did not smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want him to do what's right. It shouldn't be necessary to persuade a\nman to do that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But there may be differences of opinion about what is right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If a man had a gangrenous foot would you have patience with anyone who\nhesitated to amputate it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gangrene is a matter of fact.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And Evil?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhat Davidson had done soon appeared. The four of them had just finished\ntheir mid-day meal, and they had not yet separated for the siesta which\nthe heat imposed on the ladies and on the doctor. Davidson had little\npatience with the slothful habit. The door was suddenly flung open and\nMiss Thompson came in. She looked round the room and then went up to\nDavidson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You low-down skunk, what have you been saying about me to the\ngovernor?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was spluttering with rage. There was a moment's pause. Then the\nmissionary drew forward a chair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Won't you be seated, Miss Thompson? I've been hoping to have another\ntalk with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You poor low-life bastard.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe burst into a torrent of insult, foul and insolent. Davidson kept his\ngrave eyes on her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm indifferent to the abuse you think fit to heap on me, Miss\nThompson,\" he said, \"but I must beg you to remember that ladies are\npresent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTears by now were struggling with her anger. Her face was red and\nswollen as though she were choking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What has happened?\" asked Dr. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A feller's just been in here and he says I gotter beat it on the next\nboat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWas there a gleam in the missionary's eyes? His face remained impassive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You could hardly expect the governor to let you stay here under the\ncircumstances.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You done it,\" she shrieked. \"You can't kid me. You done it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want to deceive you. I urged the governor to take the only\npossible step consistent with his obligations.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why couldn't you leave me be? I wasn't doin' you no harm.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You may be sure that if you had I should be the last man to resent it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think I want to stay on in this poor imitation of a burg? I\ndon't look no busher, do I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In that case I don't see what cause of complaint you have,\" he\nanswered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave an inarticulate cry of rage and flung out of the room. There\nwas a short silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a relief to know that the governor has acted at last,\" said\nDavidson finally. \"He's a weak man and he shilly-shallied. He said she\nwas only here for a fortnight anyway, and if she went on to Apia, that\nwas under British jurisdiction and had nothing to do with him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe missionary sprang to his feet and strode across the room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's terrible the way the men who are in authority seek to evade their\nresponsibility. They speak as though evil that was out of sight ceased\nto be evil. The very existence of that woman is a scandal and it does\nnot help matters to shift it to another of the islands. In the end I had\nto speak straight from the shoulder.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDavidson's brow lowered, and he protruded his firm chin. He looked\nfierce and determined.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Our mission is not entirely without influence at Washington. I pointed\nout to the governor that it wouldn't do him any good if there was a\ncomplaint about the way he managed things here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When has she got to go?\" asked the doctor, after a pause.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The San Francisco boat is due here from Sydney next Tuesday. She's to\nsail on that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat was in five days' time. It was next day, when he was coming back\nfrom the hospital where for want of something better to do Macphail\nspent most of his mornings, that the half-caste stopped him as he was\ngoing upstairs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Excuse me, Dr. Macphail, Miss Thompson's sick. Will you have a look at\nher.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Certainly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHorn led him to her room. She was sitting in a chair idly, neither\nreading nor sewing, staring in front of her. She wore her white dress\nand the large hat with the flowers on it. Macphail noticed that her skin\nwas yellow and muddy under her powder, and her eyes were heavy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry to hear you're not well,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I ain't sick really. I just said that, because I just had to see\nyou. I've got to clear on a boat that's going to 'Frisco.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him and he saw that her eyes were suddenly startled. She\nopened and clenched her hands spasmodically. The trader stood at the\ndoor, listening.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So I understand,\" said the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave a little gulp.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess it ain't very convenient for me to go to 'Frisco just now. I\nwent to see the governor yesterday afternoon, but I couldn't get to him.\nI saw the secretary, and he told me I'd got to take that boat and that\nwas all there was to it. I just had to see the governor, so I waited\noutside his house this morning, and when he come out I spoke to him. He\ndidn't want to speak to me, I'll say, but I wouldn't let him shake me\noff, and at last he said he hadn't no objection to my staying here till\nthe next boat to Sydney if the Rev. Davidson will stand for it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe stopped and looked at Dr. Macphail anxiously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know exactly what I can do,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I thought maybe you wouldn't mind asking him. I swear to God I\nwon't start anything here if he'll just only let me stay. I won't go out\nof the house if that'll suit him. It's no more'n a fortnight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll ask him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He won't stand for it,\" said Horn. \"He'll have you out on Tuesday, so\nyou may as well make up your mind to it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell him I can get work in Sydney, straight stuff, I mean. 'Tain't\nasking very much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll do what I can.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And come and tell me right away, will you? I can't set down to a thing\ntill I get the dope one way or the other.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was not an errand that much pleased the doctor, and,\ncharacteristically perhaps, he went about it indirectly. He told his\nwife what Miss Thompson had said to him and asked her to speak to Mrs.\nDavidson. The missionary's attitude seemed rather arbitrary and it could\ndo no harm if the girl were allowed to stay in Pago-Pago another\nfortnight. But he was not prepared for the result of his diplomacy. The\nmissionary came to him straightway.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Davidson tells me that Thompson has been speaking to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail, thus directly tackled, had the shy man's resentment at\nbeing forced out into the open. He felt his temper rising, and he\nflushed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't see that it can make any difference if she goes to Sydney\nrather than to San Francisco, and so long as she promises to behave\nwhile she's here it's dashed hard to persecute her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe missionary fixed him with his stern eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why is she unwilling to go back to San Francisco?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't enquire,\" answered the doctor with some asperity. \"And I think\none does better to mind one's own business.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPerhaps it was not a very tactful answer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The governor has ordered her to be deported by the first boat that\nleaves the island. He's only done his duty and I will not interfere. Her\npresence is a peril here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think you're very harsh and tyrannical.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe two ladies looked up at the doctor with some alarm, but they need\nnot have feared a quarrel, for the missionary smiled gently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm terribly sorry you should think that of me, Dr. Macphail. Believe\nme, my heart bleeds for that unfortunate woman, but I'm only trying to\ndo my duty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor made no answer. He looked out of the window sullenly. For\nonce it was not raining and across the bay you saw nestling among the\ntrees the huts of a native village.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I'll take advantage of the rain stopping to go out,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Please don't bear me malice because I can't accede to your wish,\" said\nDavidson, with a melancholy smile. \"I respect you very much, doctor, and\nI should be sorry if you thought ill of me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have no doubt you have a sufficiently good opinion of yourself to\nbear mine with equanimity,\" he retorted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's one on me,\" chuckled Davidson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Dr. Macphail, vexed with himself because he had been uncivil to no\npurpose, went downstairs, Miss Thompson was waiting for him with her\ndoor ajar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well,\" she said, \"have you spoken to him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I'm sorry, he won't do anything,\" he answered, not looking at her\nin his embarrassment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut then he gave her a quick glance, for a sob broke from her. He saw\nthat her face was white with fear. It gave him a shock of dismay. And\nsuddenly he had an idea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But don't give up hope yet. I think it's a shame the way they're\ntreating you and I'm going to see the governor myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe nodded. Her face brightened.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Say, that's real good of you. I'm sure he'll let me stay if you speak\nfor me. I just won't do a thing I didn't ought all the time I'm here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail hardly knew why he had made up his mind to appeal to the\ngovernor. He was perfectly indifferent to Miss Thompson's affairs, but\nthe missionary had irritated him, and with him temper was a smouldering\nthing. He found the governor at home. He was a large, handsome man, a\nsailor, with a grey tooth-brush moustache; and he wore a spotless\nuniform of white drill.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've come to see you about a woman who's lodging in the same house as\nwe are,\" he said. \"Her name's Thompson.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess I've heard nearly enough about her, Dr. Macphail,\" said the\ngovernor, smiling. \"I've given her the order to get out next Tuesday and\nthat's all I can do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wanted to ask you if you couldn't stretch a point and let her stay\nhere till the boat comes in from San Francisco so that she can go to\nSydney. I will guarantee her good behaviour.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe governor continued to smile, but his eyes grew small and serious.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd be very glad to oblige you, Dr. Macphail, but I've given the order\nand it must stand.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor put the case as reasonably as he could, but now the governor\nceased to smile at all. He listened sullenly, with averted gaze.\nMacphail saw that he was making no impression.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry to cause any lady inconvenience, but she'll have to sail on\nTuesday and that's all there is to it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what difference can it make?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pardon me, doctor, but I don't feel called upon to explain my official\nactions except to the proper authorities.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMacphail looked at him shrewdly. He remembered Davidson's hint that he\nhad used threats, and in the governor's attitude he read a singular\nembarrassment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Davidson's a damned busybody,\" he said hotly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Between ourselves, Dr. Macphail, I don't say that I have formed a very\nfavourable opinion of Mr. Davidson, but I am bound to confess that he\nwas within his rights in pointing out to me the danger that the presence\nof a woman of Miss Thompson's character was to a place like this where a\nnumber of enlisted men are stationed among a native population.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got up and Dr. Macphail was obliged to do so too.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must ask you to excuse me. I have an engagement. Please give my\nrespects to Mrs. Macphail.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor left him crest-fallen. He knew that Miss Thompson would be\nwaiting for him, and unwilling to tell her himself that he had failed,\nhe went into the house by the back door and sneaked up the stairs as\nthough he had something to hide.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt supper he was silent and ill-at-ease, but the missionary was jovial\nand animated. Dr. Macphail thought his eyes rested on him now and then\nwith triumphant good-humour. It struck him suddenly that Davidson knew\nof his visit to the governor and of its ill success. But how on earth\ncould he have heard of it? There was something sinister about the power\nof that man. After supper he saw Horn on the verandah and, as though to\nhave a casual word with him, went out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She wants to know if you've seen the governor,\" the trader whispered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. He wouldn't do anything. I'm awfully sorry, I can't do anything\nmore.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I knew he wouldn't. They daren't go against the missionaries.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Davidson affably, coming out to join\nthem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was just saying there was no chance of your getting over to Apia for\nat least another week,\" said the trader glibly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe left them, and the two men returned into the parlour. Mr. Davidson\ndevoted one hour after each meal to recreation. Presently a timid knock\nwas heard at the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come in,\" said Mrs. Davidson, in her sharp voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe door was not opened. She got up and opened it. They saw Miss\nThompson standing at the threshold. But the change in her appearance was\nextraordinary. This was no longer the flaunting hussy who had jeered at\nthem in the road, but a broken, frightened woman. Her hair, as a rule so\nelaborately arranged, was tumbling untidily over her neck. She wore\nbedroom slippers and a skirt and blouse. They were unfresh and\nbedraggled. She stood at the door with the tears streaming down her face\nand did not dare to enter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you want?\" said Mrs. Davidson harshly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"May I speak to Mr. Davidson?\" she said in a choking voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe missionary rose and went towards her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come right in, Miss Thompson,\" he said in cordial tones. \"What can I do\nfor you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe entered the room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Say, I'm sorry for what I said to you the other day an' for--for\neverythin' else. I guess I was a bit lit up. I beg pardon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, it was nothing. I guess my back's broad enough to bear a few hard\nwords.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe stepped towards him with a movement that was horribly cringing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got me beat. I'm all in. You won't make me go back to 'Frisco?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis genial manner vanished and his voice grew on a sudden hard and\nstern.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why don't you want to go back there?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe cowered before him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess my people live there. I don't want them to see me like this.\nI'll go anywhere else you say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why don't you want to go back to San Francisco?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've told you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe leaned forward, staring at her, and his great, shining eyes seemed to\ntry to bore into her soul. He gave a sudden gasp.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The penitentiary.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe screamed, and then she fell at his feet, clasping his legs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't send me back there. I swear to you before God I'll be a good\nwoman. I'll give all this up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe burst into a torrent of confused supplication and the tears coursed\ndown her painted cheeks. He leaned over her and, lifting her face,\nforced her to look at him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is that it, the penitentiary?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I beat it before they could get me,\" she gasped. \"If the bulls grab me\nit's three years for mine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe let go his hold of her and she fell in a heap on the floor, sobbing\nbitterly. Dr. Macphail stood up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This alters the whole thing,\" he said. \"You can't make her go back when\nyou know this. Give her another chance. She wants to turn over a new\nleaf.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going to give her the finest chance she's ever had. If she repents\nlet her accept her punishment.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe misunderstood the words and looked up. There was a gleam of hope in\nher heavy eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll let me go?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. You shall sail for San Francisco on Tuesday.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave a groan of horror and then burst into low, hoarse shrieks which\nsounded hardly human, and she beat her head passionately on the ground.\nDr. Macphail sprang to her and lifted her up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come on, you mustn't do that. You'd better go to your room and lie\ndown. I'll get you something.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe raised her to her feet and partly dragging her, partly carrying her,\ngot her downstairs. He was furious with Mrs. Davidson and with his wife\nbecause they made no effort to help. The half-caste was standing on the\nlanding and with his assistance he managed to get her on the bed. She\nwas moaning and crying. She was almost insensible. He gave her a\nhypodermic injection. He was hot and exhausted when he went upstairs\nagain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got her to lie down.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe two women and Davidson were in the same positions as when he had\nleft them. They could not have moved or spoken since he went.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was waiting for you,\" said Davidson, in a strange, distant voice. \"I\nwant you all to pray with me for the soul of our erring sister.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took the Bible off a shelf, and sat down at the table at which they\nhad supped. It had not been cleared, and he pushed the tea-pot out of\nthe way. In a powerful voice, resonant and deep, he read to them the\nchapter in which is narrated the meeting of Jesus Christ with the woman\ntaken in adultery.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now kneel with me and let us pray for the soul of our dear sister,\nSadie Thompson.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe burst into a long, passionate prayer in which he implored God to have\nmercy on the sinful woman. Mrs. Macphail and Mrs. Davidson knelt with\ncovered eyes. The doctor, taken by surprise, awkward and sheepish, knelt\ntoo. The missionary's prayer had a savage eloquence. He was\nextraordinarily moved, and as he spoke the tears ran down his cheeks.\nOutside, the pitiless rain fell, fell steadily, with a fierce malignity\nthat was all too human.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last he stopped. He paused for a moment and said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We will now repeat the Lord's prayer.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey said it and then, following him, they rose from their knees. Mrs.\nDavidson's face was pale and restful. She was comforted and at peace,\nbut the Macphails felt suddenly bashful. They did not know which way to\nlook.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll just go down and see how she is now,\" said Dr. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen he knocked at her door it was opened for him by Horn. Miss Thompson\nwas in a rocking-chair, sobbing quietly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you doing there?\" exclaimed Macphail. \"I told you to lie\ndown.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't lie down. I want to see Mr. Davidson.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My poor child, what do you think is the good of it? You'll never move\nhim.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He said he'd come if I sent for him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMacphail motioned to the trader.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go and fetch him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe waited with her in silence while the trader went upstairs. Davidson\ncame in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Excuse me for asking you to come here,\" she said, looking at him\nsombrely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was expecting you to send for me. I knew the Lord would answer my\nprayer.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey stared at one another for a moment and then she looked away. She\nkept her eyes averted when she spoke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've been a bad woman. I want to repent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank God! thank God! He has heard our prayers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned to the two men.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Leave me alone with her. Tell Mrs. Davidson that our prayers have been\nanswered.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey went out and closed the door behind them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gee whizz,\" said the trader.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat night Dr. Macphail could not get to sleep till late, and when he\nheard the missionary come upstairs he looked at his watch. It was two\no'clock. But even then he did not go to bed at once, for through the\nwooden partition that separated their rooms he heard him praying aloud,\ntill he himself, exhausted, fell asleep.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen he saw him next morning he was surprised at his appearance. He was\npaler than ever, tired, but his eyes shone with inhuman fire. It looked\nas though he were filled with an overwhelming joy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want you to go down presently and see Sadie,\" he said. \"I can't hope\nthat her body is better, but her soul--her soul is transformed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor was feeling wan and nervous.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You were with her very late last night,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, she couldn't bear to have me leave her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You look as pleased as Punch,\" the doctor said irritably.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDavidson's eyes shone with ecstasy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A great mercy has been vouchsafed me. Last night I was privileged to\nbring a lost soul to the loving arms of Jesus.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Thompson was again in the rocking-chair. The bed had not been made.\nThe room was in disorder. She had not troubled to dress herself, but\nwore a dirty dressing-gown, and her hair was tied in a sluttish knot.\nShe had given her face a dab with a wet towel, but it was all swollen\nand creased with crying. She looked a drab.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe raised her eyes dully when the doctor came in. She was cowed and\nbroken.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where's Mr. Davidson?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He'll come presently if you want him,\" answered Macphail acidly. \"I\ncame here to see how you were.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I guess I'm O.K. You needn't worry about that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you had anything to eat?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Horn brought me some coffee.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked anxiously at the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you think he'll come down soon? I feel as if it wasn't so terrible\nwhen he's with me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you still going on Tuesday?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, he says I've got to go. Please tell him to come right along. You\ncan't do me any good. He's the only one as can help me now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well,\" said Dr. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDuring the next three days the missionary spent almost all his time with\nSadie Thompson. He joined the others only to have his meals. Dr.\nMacphail noticed that he hardly ate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's wearing himself out,\" said Mrs. Davidson pitifully. \"He'll have a\nbreakdown if he doesn't take care, but he won't spare himself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe herself was white and pale. She told Mrs. Macphail that she had no\nsleep. When the missionary came upstairs from Miss Thompson he prayed\ntill he was exhausted, but even then he did not sleep for long. After an\nhour or two he got up and dressed himself, and went for a tramp along\nthe bay. He had strange dreams.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This morning he told me that he'd been dreaming about the mountains of\nNebraska,\" said Mrs. Davidson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's curious,\" said Dr. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe remembered seeing them from the windows of the train when he crossed\nAmerica. They were like huge mole-hills, rounded and smooth, and they\nrose from the plain abruptly. Dr. Macphail remembered how it struck him\nthat they were like a woman's breasts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDavidson's restlessness was intolerable even to himself. But he was\nbuoyed up by a wonderful exhilaration. He was tearing out by the roots\nthe last vestiges of sin that lurked in the hidden corners of that poor\nwoman's heart. He read with her and prayed with her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's wonderful,\" he said to them one day at supper. \"It's a true\nrebirth. Her soul, which was black as night, is now pure and white like\nthe new-fallen snow. I am humble and afraid. Her remorse for all her\nsins is beautiful. I am not worthy to touch the hem of her garment.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you the heart to send her back to San Francisco?\" said the doctor.\n\"Three years in an American prison. I should have thought you might have\nsaved her from that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, but don't you see? It's necessary. Do you think my heart doesn't\nbleed for her? I love her as I love my wife and my sister. All the time\nthat she is in prison I shall suffer all the pain that she suffers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bunkum,\" cried the doctor impatiently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't understand because you're blind. She's sinned, and she must\nsuffer. I know what she'll endure. She'll be starved and tortured and\nhumiliated. I want her to accept the punishment of man as a sacrifice to\nGod. I want her to accept it joyfully. She has an opportunity which is\noffered to very few of us. God is very good and very merciful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDavidson's voice trembled with excitement. He could hardly articulate\nthe words that tumbled passionately from his lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All day I pray with her and when I leave her I pray again, I pray with\nall my might and main, so that Jesus may grant her this great mercy. I\nwant to put in her heart the passionate desire to be punished so that at\nthe end, even if I offered to let her go, she would refuse. I want her\nto feel that the bitter punishment of prison is the thank-offering that\nshe places at the feet of our Blessed Lord, who gave his life for her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe days passed slowly. The whole household, latent on the wretched,\ntortured woman downstairs, lived in a state of unnatural excitement. She\nwas like a victim that was being prepared for the savage rites of a\nbloody idolatry. Her terror numbed her. She could not bear to let\nDavidson out of her sight; it was only when he was with her that she had\ncourage, and she hung upon him with a slavish dependence. She cried a\ngreat deal, and she read the Bible, and prayed. Sometimes she was\nexhausted and apathetic. Then she did indeed look forward to her ordeal,\nfor it seemed to offer an escape, direct and concrete, from the anguish\nshe was enduring. She could not bear much longer the vague terrors which\nnow assailed her. With her sins she had put aside all personal vanity,\nand she slopped about her room, unkempt and dishevelled, in her tawdry\ndressing-gown. She had not taken off her night-dress for four days, nor\nput on stockings. Her room was littered and untidy. Meanwhile the rain\nfell with a cruel persistence. You felt that the heavens must at last be\nempty of water, but still it poured down, straight and heavy, with a\nmaddening iteration, on the iron roof. Everything was damp and clammy.\nThere was mildew on the walls and on the boots that stood on the floor.\nThrough the sleepless nights the mosquitoes droned their angry chant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If it would only stop raining for a single day it wouldn't be so bad,\"\nsaid Dr. Macphail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey all looked forward to the Tuesday when the boat for San Francisco\nwas to arrive from Sydney. The strain was intolerable. So far as Dr.\nMacphail was concerned, his pity and his resentment were alike\nextinguished by his desire to be rid of the unfortunate woman. The\ninevitable must be accepted. He felt he would breathe more freely when\nthe ship had sailed. Sadie Thompson was to be escorted on board by a\nclerk in the governor's office. This person called on the Monday evening\nand told Miss Thompson to be prepared at eleven in the morning. Davidson\nwas with her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll see that everything is ready. I mean to come on board with her\nmyself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Thompson did not speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Dr. Macphail blew out his candle and crawled cautiously under his\nmosquito curtains, he gave a sigh of relief.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, thank God that's over. By this time to-morrow she'll be gone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Davidson will be glad too. She says he's wearing himself to a\nshadow,\" said Mrs. Macphail. \"She's a different woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sadie. I should never have thought it possible. It makes one humble.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail did not answer, and presently he fell asleep. He was tired\nout, and he slept more soundly than usual.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was awakened in the morning by a hand placed on his arm, and,\nstarting up, saw Horn by the side of his bed. The trader put his finger\non his mouth to prevent any exclamation from Dr. Macphail and beckoned\nto him to come. As a rule he wore shabby ducks, but now he was barefoot\nand wore only the lava-lava of the natives. He looked suddenly savage,\nand Dr. Macphail, getting out of bed, saw that he was heavily tattooed.\nHorn made him a sign to come on to the verandah. Dr. Macphail got out of\nbed and followed the trader out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't make a noise,\" he whispered. \"You're wanted. Put on a coat and\nsome shoes. Quick.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail's first thought was that something had happened to Miss\nThompson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it? Shall I bring my instruments?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hurry, please, hurry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail crept back into the bedroom, put on a waterproof over his\npyjamas, and a pair of rubber-soled shoes. He rejoined the trader, and\ntogether they tiptoed down the stairs. The door leading out to the road\nwas open and at it were standing half a dozen natives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it?\" repeated the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come along with me,\" said Horn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe walked out and the doctor followed him. The natives came after them\nin a little bunch. They crossed the road and came on to the beach. The\ndoctor saw a group of natives standing round some object at the water's\nedge. They hurried along, a couple of dozen yards perhaps, and the\nnatives opened out as the doctor came up. The trader pushed him\nforwards. Then he saw, lying half in the water and half out, a dreadful\nobject, the body of Davidson. Dr. Macphail bent down--he was not a man\nto lose his head in an emergency--and turned the body over. The throat\nwas cut from ear to ear, and in the right hand was still the razor with\nwhich the deed was done.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's quite cold,\" said the doctor. \"He must have been dead some time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One of the boys saw him lying there on his way to work just now and\ncame and told me. Do you think he did it himself?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. Someone ought to go for the police.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHorn said something in the native tongue, and two youths started off.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We must leave him here till they come,\" said the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They mustn't take him into my house. I won't have him in my house.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll do what the authorities say,\" replied the doctor sharply. \"In\npoint of fact I expect they'll take him to the mortuary.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey stood waiting where they were. The trader took a cigarette from a\nfold in his lava-lava and gave one to Dr. Macphail. They smoked while\nthey stared at the corpse. Dr. Macphail could not understand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why do you think he did it?\" asked Horn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders. In a little while native police came\nalong, under the charge of a marine, with a stretcher, and immediately\nafterwards a couple of naval officers and a naval doctor. They managed\neverything in a business-like manner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What about the wife?\" said one of the officers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now that you've come I'll go back to the house and get some things on.\nI'll see that it's broken to her. She'd better not see him till he's\nbeen fixed up a little.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess that's right,\" said the naval doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Dr. Macphail went back he found his wife nearly dressed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Davidson's in a dreadful state about her husband,\" she said to him\nas soon as he appeared. \"He hasn't been to bed all night. She heard him\nleave Miss Thompson's room at two, but he went out. If he's been walking\nabout since then he'll be absolutely dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail told her what had happened and asked her to break the news\nto Mrs. Davidson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But why did he do it?\" she asked, horror-stricken.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I can't. I can't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a frightened look and went out. He heard her go into Mrs.\nDavidson's room. He waited a minute to gather himself together and then\nbegan to shave and wash. When he was dressed he sat down on the bed and\nwaited for his wife. At last she came.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She wants to see him,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They've taken him to the mortuary. We'd better go down with her. How\ndid she take it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think she's stunned. She didn't cry. But she's trembling like a\nleaf.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'd better go at once.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen they knocked at her door Mrs. Davidson came out. She was very pale,\nbut dry-eyed. To the doctor she seemed unnaturally composed. No word was\nexchanged, and they set out in silence down the road. When they arrived\nat the mortuary Mrs. Davidson spoke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me go in and see him alone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey stood aside. A native opened a door for her and closed it behind\nher. They sat down and waited. One or two white men came and talked to\nthem in undertones. Dr. Macphail told them again what he knew of the\ntragedy. At last the door was quietly opened and Mrs. Davidson came out.\nSilence fell upon them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm ready to go back now,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer voice was hard and steady. Dr. Macphail could not understand the\nlook in her eyes. Her pale face was very stern. They walked back slowly,\nnever saying a word, and at last they came round the bend on the other\nside of which stood their house. Mrs. Davidson gave a gasp, and for a\nmoment they stopped still. An incredible sound assaulted their ears. The\ngramophone which had been silent for so long was playing, playing\nragtime loud and harsh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's that?\" cried Mrs. Macphail with horror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let's go on,\" said Mrs. Davidson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey walked up the steps and entered the hall. Miss Thompson was\nstanding at her door, chatting with a sailor. A sudden change had taken\nplace in her. She was no longer the cowed drudge of the last days. She\nwas dressed in all her finery, in her white dress, with the high shiny\nboots over which her fat legs bulged in their cotton stockings; her hair\nwas elaborately arranged; and she wore that enormous hat covered with\ngaudy flowers. Her face was painted, her eyebrows were boldly black, and\nher lips were scarlet. She held herself erect. She was the flaunting\nqueen that they had known at first. As they came in she broke into a\nloud, jeering laugh; and then, when Mrs. Davidson involuntarily stopped,\nshe collected the spittle in her mouth and spat. Mrs. Davidson cowered\nback, and two red spots rose suddenly to her cheeks. Then, covering her\nface with her hands, she broke away and ran quickly up the stairs. Dr.\nMacphail was outraged. He pushed past the woman into her room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the devil are you doing?\" he cried. \"Stop that damned machine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went up to it and tore the record off. She turned on him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Say, doc, you can that stuff with me. What the hell are you doin' in my\nroom?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean?\" he cried. \"What d'you mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gathered herself together. No one could describe the scorn of her\nexpression or the contemptuous hatred she put into her answer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You men! You filthy, dirty pigs! You're all the same, all of you. Pigs!\nPigs!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Macphail gasped. He understood.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nBateman Hunter slept badly. For a fortnight on the boat that brought him\nfrom Tahiti to San Francisco he had been thinking of the story he had to\ntell, and for three days on the train he had repeated to himself the\nwords in which he meant to tell it. But in a few hours now he would be\nin Chicago, and doubts assailed him. His conscience, always very\nsensitive, was not at ease. He was uncertain that he had done all that\nwas possible, it was on his honour to do much more than the possible,\nand the thought was disturbing that, in a matter which so nearly touched\nhis own interest, he had allowed his interest to prevail over his\nquixotry. Self-sacrifice appealed so keenly to his imagination that the\ninability to exercise it gave him a sense of disillusion. He was like\nthe philanthropist who with altruistic motives builds model dwellings\nfor the poor and finds that he has made a lucrative investment. He\ncannot prevent the satisfaction he feels in the ten per cent which\nrewards the bread he had cast upon the waters, but he has an awkward\nfeeling that it detracts somewhat from the savour of his virtue. Bateman\nHunter knew that his heart was pure, but he was not quite sure how\nsteadfastly, when he told her his story, he would endure the scrutiny of\nIsabel Longstaffe's cool grey eyes. They were far-seeing and wise. She\nmeasured the standards of others by her own meticulous uprightness and\nthere could be no greater censure than the cold silence with which she\nexpressed her disapproval of a conduct that did not satisfy her exacting\ncode. There was no appeal from her judgment, for, having made up her\nmind, she never changed it. But Bateman would not have had her\ndifferent. He loved not only the beauty of her person, slim and\nstraight, with the proud carriage of her head, but still more the beauty\nof her soul. With her truthfulness, her rigid sense of honour, her\nfearless outlook, she seemed to him to collect in herself all that was\nmost admirable in his countrywomen. But he saw in her something more\nthan the perfect type of the American girl, he felt that her\nexquisiteness was peculiar in a way to her environment, and he was\nassured that no city in the world could have produced her but Chicago. A\npang seized him when he remembered that he must deal so bitter a blow to\nher pride, and anger flamed up in his heart when he thought of Edward\nBarnard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut at last the train steamed in to Chicago and he exulted when he saw\nthe long streets of grey houses. He could hardly bear his impatience at\nthe thought of State and Wabash with their crowded pavements, their\nhustling traffic, and their noise. He was at home. And he was glad that\nhe had been born in the most important city in the United States. San\nFrancisco was provincial, New York was effete; the future of America lay\nin the development of its economic possibilities, and Chicago, by its\nposition and by the energy of its citizens, was destined to become the\nreal capital of the country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess I shall live long enough to see it the biggest city in the\nworld,\" Bateman said to himself as he stepped down to the platform.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis father had come to meet him, and after a hearty handshake, the pair\nof them, tall, slender, and well-made, with the same fine, ascetic\nfeatures and thin lips, walked out of the station. Mr. Hunter's\nautomobile was waiting for them and they got in. Mr. Hunter caught his\nson's proud and happy glance as he looked at the street.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Glad to be back, son?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should just think I was,\" said Bateman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis eyes devoured the restless scene.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess there's a bit more traffic here than in your South Sea island,\"\nlaughed Mr. Hunter. \"Did you like it there?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give me Chicago, dad,\" answered Bateman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You haven't brought Edward Barnard back with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How was he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman was silent for a moment, and his handsome, sensitive face\ndarkened.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd sooner not speak about him, dad,\" he said at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's all right, my son. I guess your mother will be a happy woman\nto-day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey passed out of the crowded streets in the Loop and drove along the\nlake till they came to the imposing house, an exact copy of a château on\nthe Loire, which Mr. Hunter had built himself some years before. As soon\nas Bateman was alone in his room he asked for a number on the telephone.\nHis heart leaped when he heard the voice that answered him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-morning, Isabel,\" he said gaily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-morning, Bateman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did you recognise my voice?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is not so long since I heard it last. Besides, I was expecting you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When may I see you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Unless you have anything better to do perhaps you'll dine with us\nto-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know very well that I couldn't possibly have anything better to\ndo.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose that you're full of news?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe thought he detected in her voice a note of apprehension.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you must tell me to-night. Good-bye.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe rang off. It was characteristic of her that she should be able to\nwait so many unnecessary hours to know what so immensely concerned her.\nTo Bateman there was an admirable fortitude in her restraint.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt dinner, at which beside himself and Isabel no one was present but her\nfather and mother, he watched her guide the conversation into the\nchannels of an urbane small-talk, and it occurred to him that in just\nsuch a manner would a marquise under the shadow of the guillotine toy\nwith the affairs of a day that would know no morrow. Her delicate\nfeatures, the aristocratic shortness of her upper lip, and her wealth of\nfair hair suggested the marquise again, and it must have been obvious,\neven if it were not notorious, that in her veins flowed the best blood\nin Chicago. The dining-room was a fitting frame to her fragile beauty,\nfor Isabel had caused the house, a replica of a palace on the Grand\nCanal at Venice, to be furnished by an English expert in the style of\nLouis XV; and the graceful decoration linked with the name of that\namorous monarch enhanced her loveliness and at the same time acquired\nfrom it a more profound significance. For Isabel's mind was richly\nstored, and her conversation, however light, was never flippant. She\nspoke now of the Musicale to which she and her mother had been in the\nafternoon, of the lectures which an English poet was giving at the\nAuditorium, of the political situation, and of the Old Master which her\nfather had recently bought for fifty thousand dollars in New York. It\ncomforted Bateman to hear her. He felt that he was once more in the\ncivilised world, at the centre of culture and distinction; and certain\nvoices, troubling and yet against his will refusing to still their\nclamour, were at last silent in his heart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gee, but it's good to be back in Chicago,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last dinner was over, and when they went out of the dining-room\nIsabel said to her mother:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going to take Bateman along to my den. We have various things to\ntalk about.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well, my dear,\" said Mrs. Longstaffe. \"You'll find your father and\nme in the Madame du Barry room when you're through.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIsabel led the young man upstairs and showed him into the room of which\nhe had so many charming memories. Though he knew it so well he could not\nrepress the exclamation of delight which it always wrung from him. She\nlooked round with a smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think it's a success,\" she said. \"The main thing is that it's right.\nThere's not even an ash-tray that isn't of the period.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose that's what makes it so wonderful. Like all you do it's so\nsuperlatively right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey sat down in front of a log fire and Isabel looked at him with calm\ngrave eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now what have you to say to me?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hardly know how to begin.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is Edward Barnard coming back?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a long silence before Bateman spoke again, and with each of\nthem it was filled with many thoughts. It was a difficult story he had\nto tell, for there were things in it which were so offensive to her\nsensitive ears that he could not bear to tell them, and yet in justice\nto her, no less than in justice to himself, he must tell her the whole\ntruth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt had all begun long ago when he and Edward Barnard, still at college,\nhad met Isabel Longstaffe at the tea-party given to introduce her to\nsociety. They had both known her when she was a child and they\nlong-legged boys, but for two years she had been in Europe to finish her\neducation and it was with a surprised delight that they renewed\nacquaintance with the lovely girl who returned. Both of them fell\ndesperately in love with her, but Bateman saw quickly that she had eyes\nonly for Edward, and, devoted to his friend, he resigned himself to the\nrole of confidant. He passed bitter moments, but he could not deny that\nEdward was worthy of his good fortune, and, anxious that nothing should\nimpair the friendship he so greatly valued, he took care never by a hint\nto disclose his own feelings. In six months the young couple were\nengaged. But they were very young and Isabel's father decided that they\nshould not marry at least till Edward graduated. They had to wait a\nyear. Bateman remembered the winter at the end of which Isabel and\nEdward were to be married, a winter of dances and theatre-parties and of\ninformal gaieties at which he, the constant third, was always present.\nHe loved her no less because she would shortly be his friend's wife; her\nsmile, a gay word she flung him, the confidence of her affection, never\nceased to delight him; and he congratulated himself, somewhat\ncomplacently, because he did not envy them their happiness. Then an\naccident happened. A great bank failed, there was a panic on the\nexchange, and Edward Barnard's father found himself a ruined man. He\ncame home one night told his wife that he was penniless, and after\ndinner, going into his study, shot himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA week later, Edward Barnard, with a tired, white face, went to Isabel\nand asked her to release him. Her only answer was to throw her arms\nround his neck and burst into tears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't make it harder for me, sweet,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think I can let you go now? I love you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How can I ask you to marry me? The whole thing's hopeless. Your father\nwould never let you. I haven't a cent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do I care? I love you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe told her his plans. He had to earn money at once, and George\nBraunschmidt, an old friend of his family, had offered to take him into\nhis own business. He was a South Sea merchant, and he had agencies in\nmany of the islands of the Pacific. He had suggested that Edward should\ngo to Tahiti for a year or two, where under the best of his managers he\ncould learn the details of that varied trade, and at the end of that\ntime he promised the young man a position in Chicago. It was a wonderful\nopportunity, and when he had finished his explanations Isabel was once\nmore all smiles.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You foolish boy, why have you been trying to make me miserable?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis face lit up at her words and his eyes flashed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Isabel, you don't mean to say you'll wait for me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you think you're worth it?\" she smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, don't laugh at me now. I beseech you to be serious. It may be for\ntwo years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have no fear. I love you, Edward. When you come back I will marry you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEdward's employer was a man who did not like delay and he had told him\nthat if he took the post he offered he must sail that day week from San\nFrancisco. Edward spent his last evening with Isabel. It was after\ndinner that Mr. Longstaffe, saying he wanted a word with Edward, took\nhim into the smoking-room. Mr. Longstaffe had accepted good-naturedly\nthe arrangement which his daughter had told him of and Edward could not\nimagine what mysterious communication he had now to make. He was not a\nlittle perplexed to see that his host was embarrassed. He faltered. He\ntalked of trivial things. At last he blurted it out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess you've heard of Arnold Jackson,\" he said, looking at Edward\nwith a frown.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEdward hesitated. His natural truthfulness obliged him to admit a\nknowledge he would gladly have been able to deny.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I have. But it's a long time ago. I guess I didn't pay very much\nattention.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There are not many people in Chicago who haven't heard of Arnold\nJackson,\" said Mr. Longstaffe bitterly, \"and if there are they'll have\nno difficulty in finding someone who'll be glad to tell them. Did you\nknow he was Mrs. Longstaffe's brother?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I knew that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course we've had no communication with him for many years. He left\nthe country as soon as he was able to, and I guess the country wasn't\nsorry to see the last of him. We understand he lives in Tahiti. My\nadvice to you is to give him a wide berth, but if you do hear anything\nabout him Mrs. Longstaffe and I would be very glad if you'd let us\nknow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sure.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That was all I wanted to say to you. Now I daresay you'd like to join\nthe ladies.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere are few families that have not among their members one whom, if\ntheir neighbours permitted, they would willingly forget, and they are\nfortunate when the lapse of a generation or two has invested his\nvagaries with a romantic glamour. But when he is actually alive, if his\npeculiarities are not of the kind that can be condoned by the phrase,\n\"he is nobody's enemy but his own\", a safe one when the culprit has no\nworse to answer for than alcoholism or wandering affections, the only\npossible course is silence. And it was this which the Longstaffes had\nadopted towards Arnold Jackson. They never talked of him. They would not\neven pass through the street in which he had lived. Too kind to make his\nwife and children suffer for his misdeeds, they had supported them for\nyears, but on the understanding that they should live in Europe. They\ndid everything they could to blot out all recollection of Arnold Jackson\nand yet were conscious that the story was as fresh in the public mind as\nwhen first the scandal burst upon a gaping world. Arnold Jackson was as\nblack a sheep as any family could suffer from. A wealthy banker,\nprominent in his church, a philanthropist, a man respected by all, not\nonly for his connections (in his veins ran the blue blood of Chicago),\nbut also for his upright character, he was arrested one day on a charge\nof fraud; and the dishonesty which the trial brought to light was not of\nthe sort which could be explained by a sudden temptation; it was\ndeliberate and systematic. Arnold Jackson was a rogue. When he was sent\nto the penitentiary for seven years there were few who did not think he\nhad escaped lightly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen at the end of this last evening the lovers separated it was with\nmany protestations of devotion. Isabel, all tears, was consoled a little\nby her certainty of Edward's passionate love. It was a strange feeling\nthat she had. It made her wretched to part from him and yet she was\nhappy because he adored her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis was more than two years ago.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had written to her by every mail since then, twenty-four letters in\nall, for the mail went but once a month, and his letters had been all\nthat a lover's letters should be. They were intimate and charming,\nhumorous sometimes, especially of late, and tender. At first they\nsuggested that he was homesick, they were full of his desire to get back\nto Chicago and Isabel; and, a little anxiously, she wrote begging him to\npersevere. She was afraid that he might throw up his opportunity and\ncome racing back. She did not want her lover to lack endurance and she\nquoted to him the lines:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"<i>I could not love thee, dear, so much,</i>\n<br>\n<i>Loved I not honour more.</i>\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nBut presently he seemed to settle down and it made Isabel very happy to\nobserve his growing enthusiasm to introduce American methods into that\nforgotten corner of the world. But she knew him, and at the end of the\nyear, which was the shortest time he could possibly stay in Tahiti, she\nexpected to have to use all her influence to dissuade him from coming\nhome. It was much better that he should learn the business thoroughly,\nand if they had been able to wait a year there seemed no reason why they\nshould not wait another. She talked it over with Bateman Hunter, always\nthe most generous of friends (during those first few days after Edward\nwent she did not know what she would have done without him), and they\ndecided that Edward's future must stand before everything. It was with\nrelief that she found as the time passed that he made no suggestion of\nreturning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's splendid, isn't he?\" she exclaimed to Bateman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's white, through and through.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Reading between the lines of his letter I know he hates it over there,\nbut he's sticking it out because...\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe blushed a little and Bateman, with the grave smile which was so\nattractive in him, finished the sentence for her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Because he loves you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It makes me feel so humble,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're wonderful, Isabel, you're perfectly wonderful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the second year passed and every month Isabel continued to receive a\nletter from Edward, and presently it began to seem a little strange that\nhe did not speak of coming back. He wrote as though he were settled\ndefinitely in Tahiti, and what was more, comfortably settled. She was\nsurprised. Then she read his letters again, all of them, several times;\nand now, reading between the lines indeed, she was puzzled to notice a\nchange which had escaped her. The later letters were as tender and as\ndelightful as the first, but the tone was different. She was vaguely\nsuspicious of their humour, she had the instinctive mistrust of her sex\nfor that unaccountable quality, and she discerned in them now a\nflippancy which perplexed her. She was not quite certain that the Edward\nwho wrote to her now was the same Edward that she had known. One\nafternoon, the day after a mail had arrived from Tahiti, when she was\ndriving with Bateman he said to her:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did Edward tell you when he was sailing?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, he didn't mention it. I thought he might have said something to you\nabout it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not a word.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know what Edward is,\" she laughed in reply, \"he has no sense of\ntime. If it occurs to you next time you write you might ask him when\nhe's thinking of coming.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer manner was so unconcerned that only Bateman's acute sensitiveness\ncould have discerned in her request a very urgent desire. He laughed\nlightly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. I'll ask him. I can't imagine what he's thinking about.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA few days later, meeting him again, she noticed that something troubled\nhim. They had been much together since Edward left Chicago; they were\nboth devoted to him and each in his desire to talk of the absent one\nfound a willing listener; the consequence was that Isabel knew every\nexpression of Bateman's face, and his denials now were useless against\nher keen instinct. Something told her that his harassed look had to do\nwith Edward and she did not rest till she had made him confess.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The fact is,\" he said at last, \"I heard in a roundabout way that Edward\nwas no longer working for Braunschmidt and Co., and yesterday I took the\nopportunity to ask Mr. Braunschmidt himself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Edward left his employment with them nearly a year ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How strange he should have said nothing about it!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman hesitated, but he had gone so far now that he was obliged to\ntell the rest. It made him feel dreadfully embarrassed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was fired.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In heaven's name what for?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It appears they warned him once or twice, and at last they told him to\nget out. They say he was lazy and incompetent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Edward?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were silent for a while, and then he saw that Isabel was crying.\nInstinctively he seized her hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my dear, don't, don't,\" he said. \"I can't bear to see it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was so unstrung that she let her hand rest in his. He tried to\nconsole her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's incomprehensible, isn't it? It's so unlike Edward. I can't help\nfeeling there must be some mistake.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe did not say anything for a while, and when she spoke it was\nhesitatingly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Has it struck you that there was anything queer in his letters lately?\"\nshe asked, looking away, her eyes all bright with tears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not quite know how to answer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have noticed a change in them,\" he admitted. \"He seems to have lost\nthat high seriousness which I admired so much in him. One would almost\nthink that the things that matter--well, don't matter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIsabel did not reply. She was vaguely uneasy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps in his answer to your letter he'll say when he's coming home.\nAll we can do is to wait for that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnother letter came from Edward for each of them, and still he made no\nmention of his return; but when he wrote he could not have received\nBateman's enquiry. The next mail would bring them an answer to that. The\nnext mail came, and Bateman brought Isabel the letter he had just\nreceived; but the first glance of his face was enough to tell her that\nhe was disconcerted. She read it through carefully and then, with\nslightly tightened lips, read it again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a very strange letter,\" she said. \"I don't quite understand it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One might almost think that he was joshing me,\" said Bateman, flushing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It reads like that, but it must be unintentional. That's so unlike\nEdward.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He says nothing about coming back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If I weren't so confident of his love I should think... I hardly\nknow what I should think.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was then that Bateman had broached the scheme which during the\nafternoon had formed itself in his brain. The firm, founded by his\nfather, in which he was now a partner, a firm which manufactured all\nmanner of motor vehicles, was about to establish agencies in Honolulu,\nSydney, and Wellington; and Bateman proposed that himself should go\ninstead of the manager, who had been suggested. He could return by\nTahiti; in fact, travelling from Wellington, it was inevitable to do so;\nand he could see Edward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's some mystery and I'm going to clear it up. That's the only way\nto do it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Bateman, how can you be so good and kind?\" she exclaimed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know there's nothing in the world I want more than your happiness,\nIsabel.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him and she gave him her hands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're wonderful, Bateman. I didn't know there was anyone in the world\nlike you. How can I ever thank you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want your thanks. I only want to be allowed to help you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe dropped her eyes and flushed a little. She was so used to him that\nshe had forgotten how handsome he was. He was as tall as Edward and as\nwell made, but he was dark and pale of face, while Edward was ruddy. Of\ncourse she knew he loved her. It touched her. She felt very tenderly\ntowards him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was from this journey that Bateman Hunter was now returned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe business part of it took him somewhat longer than he expected and he\nhad much time to think of his two friends. He had come to the conclusion\nthat it could be nothing serious that prevented Edward from coming home,\na pride, perhaps, which made him determined to make good before he\nclaimed the bride he adored; but it was a pride that must be reasoned\nwith. Isabel was unhappy. Edward must come back to Chicago with him and\nmarry her at once. A position could be found for him in the works of the\nHunter Motor Traction and Automobile Company. Bateman, with a bleeding\nheart, exulted at the prospect of giving happiness to the two persons he\nloved best in the world at the cost of his own. He would never marry. He\nwould be godfather to the children of Edward and Isabel, and many years\nlater when they were both dead he would tell Isabel's daughter how long,\nlong ago he had loved her mother. Bateman's eyes were veiled with tears\nwhen he pictured this scene to himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMeaning to take Edward by surprise he had not cabled to announce his\narrival, and when at last he landed at Tahiti he allowed a youth, who\nsaid he was the son of the house, to lead him to the Hotel de la Fleur.\nHe chuckled when he thought of his friend's amazement on seeing him, the\nmost unexpected of visitors, walk into his office.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way,\" he asked, as they went along, \"can you tell me where I\nshall find Mr. Edward Barnard?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Barnard?\" said the youth. \"I seem to know the name.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's an American. A tall fellow with light brown hair and blue eyes.\nHe's been here over two years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course. Now I know who you mean. You mean Mr. Jackson's nephew.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Whose nephew?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Arnold Jackson.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think we're speaking of the same person,\" answered Bateman,\nfrigidly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was startled. It was queer that Arnold Jackson, known apparently to\nall and sundry, should live here under the disgraceful name in which he\nhad been convicted. But Bateman could not imagine whom it was that he\npassed off as his nephew. Mrs. Longstaffe was his only sister and he had\nnever had a brother. The young man by his side talked volubly in an\nEnglish that had something in it of the intonation of a foreign tongue,\nand Bateman, with a sidelong glance, saw, what he had not noticed\nbefore, that there was in him a good deal of native blood. A touch of\nhauteur involuntarily entered into his manner. They reached the hotel.\nWhen he had arranged about his room Bateman asked to be directed to the\npremises of Braunschmidt & Co. They were on the front, facing the\nlagoon, and, glad to feel the solid earth under his feet after eight\ndays at sea, he sauntered down the sunny road to the water's edge.\nHaving found the place he sought, Bateman sent in his card to the\nmanager and was led through a lofty barn-like room, half store and half\nwarehouse, to an office in which sat a stout, spectacled, bald-headed\nman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can you tell me where I shall find Mr. Edward Barnard? I understand he\nwas in this office for some time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is so. I don't know just where he is.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I thought he came here with a particular recommendation from Mr.\nBraunschmidt. I know Mr. Braunschmidt very well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe fat man looked at Bateman with shrewd, suspicious eyes. He called to\none of the boys in the warehouse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Say, Henry, where's Barnard now, d'you know?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's working at Cameron's, I think,\" came the answer from someone who\ndid not trouble to move.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe fat man nodded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you turn to your left when you get out of here you'll come to\nCameron's in about three minutes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman hesitated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I should tell you that Edward Barnard is my greatest friend. I\nwas very much surprised when I heard he'd left Braunschmidt & Co.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe fat man's eyes contracted till they seemed like pin-points, and\ntheir scrutiny made Bateman so uncomfortable that he felt himself\nblushing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess Braunschmidt & Co. and Edward Barnard didn't see eye to eye on\ncertain matters,\" he replied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman did not quite like the fellow's manner, so he got up, not\nwithout dignity, and with an apology for troubling him bade him\ngood-day. He left the place with a singular feeling that the man he had\njust interviewed had much to tell him, but no intention of telling it.\nHe walked in the direction indicated and soon found himself at\nCameron's. It was a trader's store, such as he had passed half a dozen\nof on his way, and when he entered the first person he saw, in his\nshirt-sleeves, measuring out a length of trade cotton, was Edward. It\ngave him a start to see him engaged in so humble an occupation. But he\nhad scarcely appeared when Edward, looking up, caught sight of him, and\ngave a joyful cry of surprise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bateman! Who ever thought of seeing you here?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe stretched his arm across the counter and wrung Bateman's hand. There\nwas no self-consciousness in his manner and the embarrassment was all on\nBateman's side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Just wait till I've wrapped this package.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith perfect assurance he ran his scissors across the stuff, folded it,\nmade it into a parcel, and handed it to the dark-skinned customer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pay at the desk, please.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen, smiling, with bright eyes, he turned to Bateman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did you show up here? Gee, I am delighted to see you. Sit down, old\nman. Make yourself at home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We can't talk here. Come along to my hotel. I suppose you can get\naway?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis he added with some apprehension.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I can get away. We're not so business-like as all that in\nTahiti.\" He called out to a Chinese who was standing behind the opposite\ncounter. \"Ah-Ling, when the boss comes tell him a friend of mine's just\narrived from America and I've gone out to have a dram with him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All-light,\" said the Chinese, with a grin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEdward slipped on a coat and, putting on his hat, accompanied Bateman\nout of the store. Bateman attempted to put the matter facetiously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't expect to find you selling three and a half yards of rotten\ncotton to a greasy nigger,\" he laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Braunschmidt fired me, you know, and I thought that would do as well as\nanything else.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEdward's candour seemed to Bateman very surprising, but he thought it\nindiscreet to pursue the subject.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess you won't make a fortune where you are,\" he answered, somewhat\ndryly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess not. But I earn enough to keep body and soul together, and I'm\nquite satisfied with that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You wouldn't have been two years ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We grow wiser as we grow older,\" retorted Edward, gaily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman took a glance at him. Edward was dressed in a suit of shabby\nwhite ducks, none too clean, and a large straw hat of native make. He\nwas thinner than he had been, deeply burned by the sun, and he was\ncertainly better-looking than ever. But there was something in his\nappearance that disconcerted Bateman. He walked with a new jauntiness;\nthere was a carelessness in his demeanour, a gaiety about nothing in\nparticular, which Bateman could not precisely blame, but which\nexceedingly puzzled him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm blest if I can see what he's got to be so darned cheerful about,\"\nhe said to himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey arrived at the hotel and sat on the terrace. A Chinese boy brought\nthem cocktails. Edward was most anxious to hear all the news of Chicago\nand bombarded his friend with eager questions. His interest was natural\nand sincere. But the odd thing was that it seemed equally divided among\na multitude of subjects. He was as eager to know how Bateman's father\nwas as what Isabel was doing. He talked of her without a shade of\nembarrassment, but she might just as well have been his sister as his\npromised wife; and before Bateman had done analysing the exact meaning\nof Edward's remarks he found that the conversation had drifted to his\nown work and the buildings his father had lately erected. He was\ndetermined to bring the conversation back to Isabel and was looking for\nthe occasion when he saw Edward wave his hand cordially. A man was\nadvancing towards them on the terrace, but Bateman's back was turned to\nhim and he could not see him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come and sit down,\" said Edward gaily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe newcomer approached. He was a very tall, thin man, in white ducks,\nwith a fine head of curly white hair. His face was thin too, long, with\na large, hooked nose and a beautiful, expressive mouth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is my old friend Bateman Hunter. I've told you about him,\" said\nEdward, his constant smile breaking on his lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Hunter. I used to know your father.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe stranger held out his hand and took the young man's in a strong,\nfriendly grasp. It was not till then that Edward mentioned the other's\nname.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Arnold Jackson.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman turned white and he felt his hands grow cold. This was the\nforger, the convict, this was Isabel's uncle. He did not know what to\nsay. He tried to conceal his confusion. Arnold Jackson looked at him\nwith twinkling eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I daresay my name is familiar to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman did not know whether to say yes or no, and what made it more\nawkward was that both Jackson and Edward seemed to be amused. It was bad\nenough to have forced on him the acquaintance of the one man on the\nisland he would rather have avoided, but worse to discern that he was\nbeing made a fool of. Perhaps, however, he had reached this conclusion\ntoo quickly, for Jackson, without a pause, added:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I understand you're very friendly with the Longstaffes. Mary Longstaffe\nis my sister.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow Bateman asked himself if Arnold Jackson could think him ignorant of\nthe most terrible scandal that Chicago had ever known. But Jackson put\nhis hand on Edward's shoulder.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't sit down, Teddie,\" he said. \"I'm busy. But you two boys had\nbetter come up and dine to-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That'll be fine,\" said Edward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's very kind of you, Mr. Jackson,\" said Bateman, frigidly, \"but I'm\nhere for so short a time; my boat sails to-morrow, you know; I think if\nyou'll forgive me, I won't come.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, nonsense. I'll give you a native dinner. My wife's a wonderful\ncook. Teddie will show you the way. Come early so as to see the sunset.\nI can give you both a shake-down if you like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course we'll come,\" said Edward. \"There's always the devil of a row\nin the hotel on the night a boat arrives and we can have a good yarn up\nat the bungalow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't let you off, Mr. Hunter,\" Jackson continued with the utmost\ncordiality. \"I want to hear all about Chicago and Mary.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe nodded and walked away before Bateman could say another word.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We don't take refusals in Tahiti,\" laughed Edward. \"Besides, you'll get\nthe best dinner on the island.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did he mean by saying his wife was a good cook? I happen to know\nhis wife's in Geneva.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's a long way off for a wife, isn't it?\" said Edward. \"And it's a\nlong time since he saw her. I guess it's another wife he's talking\nabout.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor some time Bateman was silent. His face was set in grave lines. But\nlooking up he caught the amused look in Edward's eyes, and he flushed\ndarkly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Arnold Jackson is a despicable rogue,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I greatly fear he is,\" answered Edward, smiling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't see how any decent man can have anything to do with him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps I'm not a decent man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you see much of him, Edward?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, quite a lot. He's adopted me as his nephew.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman leaned forward and fixed Edward with his searching eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you like him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But don't you know, doesn't everyone here know, that he's a forger and\nthat he's been a convict? He ought to be hounded out of civilised\nsociety.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEdward watched a ring of smoke that floated from his cigar into the\nstill, scented air.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose he is a pretty unmitigated rascal,\" he said at last. \"And I\ncan't flatter myself that any repentance for his misdeeds offers one an\nexcuse for condoning them. He was a swindler and a hypocrite. You can't\nget away from it. I never met a more agreeable companion. He's taught me\neverything I know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What has he taught you?\" cried Bateman in amazement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How to live.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman broke into ironical laughter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A fine master. Is it owing to his lessons that you lost the chance of\nmaking a fortune and earn your living now by serving behind a counter in\na ten-cent store?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He has a wonderful personality,\" said Edward, smiling goodnaturedly.\n\"Perhaps you'll see what I mean to-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not going to dine with him if that's what you mean. Nothing would\ninduce me to set foot within that man's house.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come to oblige me, Bateman. We've been friends for so many years, you\nwon't refuse me a favour when I ask it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEdward's tone had in it a quality new to Bateman. Its gentleness was\nsingularly persuasive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you put it like that, Edward, I'm bound to come,\" he smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman reflected, moreover, that it would be as well to learn what he\ncould about Arnold Jackson. It was plain that he had a great ascendency\nover Edward, and if it was to be combated it was necessary to discover\nin what exactly it consisted. The more he talked with Edward the more\nconscious he became that a change had taken place in him. He had an\ninstinct that it behooved him to walk warily, and he made up his mind\nnot to broach the real purport of his visit till he saw his way more\nclearly. He began to talk of one thing and another, of his journey and\nwhat he had achieved by it, of politics in Chicago, of this common\nfriend and that, of their days together at college.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last Edward said he must get back to his work and proposed that he\nshould fetch Bateman at five so that they could drive out together to\nArnold Jackson's house.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, I rather thought you'd be living at this hotel,\" said\nBateman, as he strolled out of the garden with Edward. \"I understand\nit's the only decent one here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not I,\" laughed Edward. \"It's a deal too grand for me. I rent a room\njust outside the town. It's cheap and clean.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If I remember right those weren't the points that seemed most important\nto you when you lived in Chicago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Chicago!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what you mean by that, Edward. It's the greatest city in\nthe world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know,\" said Edward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman glanced at him quickly, but his face was inscrutable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When are you coming back to it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I often wonder,\" smiled Edward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis answer, and the manner of it, staggered Bateman, but before he\ncould ask for an explanation Edward waved to a half-caste who was\ndriving a passing motor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give us a ride down, Charlie,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe nodded to Bateman, and ran after the machine that had pulled up a few\nyards in front. Bateman was left to piece together a mass of perplexing\nimpressions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEdward called for him in a rickety trap drawn by an old mare, and they\ndrove along a road that ran by the sea. On each side of it were\nplantations, coconut and vanilla; and now and then they saw a great\nmango, its fruit yellow and red and purple among the massy green of the\nleaves, now and then they had a glimpse of the lagoon, smooth and blue,\nwith here and there a tiny islet graceful with tall palms. Arnold\nJackson's house stood on a little hill and only a path led to it, so\nthey unharnessed the mare and tied her to a tree, leaving the trap by\nthe side of the road. To Bateman it seemed a happy-go-lucky way of doing\nthings. But when they went up to the house they were met by a tall,\nhandsome native woman, no longer young, with whom Edward cordially shook\nhands. He introduced Bateman to her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is my friend Mr. Hunter. We're going to dine with you, Lavina.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right,\" she said, with a quick smile. \"Arnold ain't back yet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'll go down and bathe. Let us have a couple of pareos.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe woman nodded and went into the house.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is that?\" asked Bateman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, that's Lavina. She's Arnold's wife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman tightened his lips, but said nothing. In a moment the woman\nreturned with a bundle, which she gave to Edward; and the two men,\nscrambling down a steep path, made their way to a grove of coconut trees\non the beach. They undressed and Edward showed his friend how to make\nthe strip of red trade cotton which is called a pareo into a very neat\npair of bathing-drawers. Soon they were splashing in the warm, shallow\nwater. Edward was in great spirits. He laughed and shouted and sang. He\nmight have been fifteen. Bateman had never seen him so gay, and\nafterwards when they lay on the beach, smoking cigarettes, in the limpid\nair, there was such an irresistible light-heartedness in him that\nBateman was taken aback.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You seem to find life mighty pleasant,\" said he.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey heard a soft movement and looking round saw that Arnold Jackson was\ncoming towards them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought I'd come down and fetch you two boys back,\" he said. \"Did you\nenjoy your bath, Mr. Hunter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very much,\" said Bateman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nArnold Jackson, no longer in spruce ducks, wore nothing but a pareo\nround his loins and walked barefoot. His body was deeply browned by the\nsun. With his long, curling white hair and his ascetic face he made a\nfantastic figure in the native dress, but he bore himself without a\ntrace of self-consciousness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you're ready we'll go right up,\" said Jackson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll just put on my clothes,\" said Bateman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, Teddie, didn't you bring a pareo for your friend?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess he'd rather wear clothes,\" smiled Edward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I certainly would,\" answered Bateman, grimly, as he saw Edward gird\nhimself in the loincloth and stand ready to start before he himself had\ngot his shirt on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Won't you find it rough walking without your shoes?\" he asked Edward.\n\"It struck me the path was a trifle rocky.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I'm used to it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a comfort to get into a pareo when one gets back from town,\" said\nJackson. \"If you were going to stay here I should strongly recommend you\nto adopt it. It's one of the most sensible costumes I have ever come\nacross. It's cool, convenient, and inexpensive.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey walked up to the house, and Jackson took them into a large room\nwith white-washed walls and an open ceiling in which a table was laid\nfor dinner. Bateman noticed that it was set for five.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Eva, come and show yourself to Teddie's friend, and then shake us a\ncocktail,\" called Jackson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he led Bateman to a long low window.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look at that,\" he said, with a dramatic gesture. \"Look well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBelow them coconut trees tumbled down steeply to the lagoon, and the\nlagoon in the evening light had the colour, tender and varied, of a\ndove's breast. On a creek, at a little distance, were the clustered huts\nof a native village, and towards the reef was a canoe, sharply\nsilhouetted, in which were a couple of natives fishing. Then, beyond,\nyou saw the vast calmness of the Pacific and twenty miles away, airy and\nunsubstantial like the fabric of a poet's fancy, the unimaginable beauty\nof the island which is called Murea. It was all so lovely that Bateman\nstood abashed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" he said at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nArnold Jackson stood staring in front of him, and in his eyes was a\ndreamy softness. His thin, thoughtful face was very grave. Bateman,\nglancing at it, was once more conscious of its intense spirituality.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Beauty,\" murmured Arnold Jackson. \"You seldom see beauty face to face.\nLook at it well, Mr. Hunter, for what you see now you will never see\nagain, since the moment is transitory, but it will be an imperishable\nmemory in your heart. You touch eternity.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis voice was deep and resonant. He seemed to breathe forth the purest\nidealism, and Bateman had to urge himself to remember that the man who\nspoke was a criminal and a cruel cheat. But Edward, as though he heard a\nsound, turned round quickly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Here is my daughter, Mr. Hunter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman shook hands with her. She had dark, splendid eyes and a red\nmouth tremulous with laughter; but her skin was brown, and her curling\nhair, rippling down her shoulders, was coal-black. She wore but one\ngarment, a Mother Hubbard of pink cotton, her feet were bare, and she\nwas crowned with a wreath of white scented flowers. She was a lovely\ncreature. She was like a goddess of the Polynesian spring.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was a little shy, but not more shy than Bateman, to whom the whole\nsituation was highly embarrassing, and it did not put him at his ease to\nsee this sylph-like thing take a shaker and with a practised hand mix\nthree cocktails.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let us have a kick in them, child,\" said Jackson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe poured them out and smiling delightfully handed one to each of the\nmen. Bateman flattered himself on his skill in the subtle art of shaking\ncocktails and he was not a little astonished, on tasting this one, to\nfind that it was excellent. Jackson laughed proudly when he saw his\nguest's involuntary look of appreciation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not bad, is it? I taught the child myself, and in the old days in\nChicago I considered that there wasn't a bar-tender in the city that\ncould hold a candle to me. When I had nothing better to do in the\npenitentiary I used to amuse myself by thinking out new cocktails, but\nwhen you come down to brass-tacks there's nothing to beat a dry\nMartini.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman felt as though someone had given him a violent blow on the\nfunny-bone and he was conscious that he turned red and then white. But\nbefore he could think of anything to say a native boy brought in a great\nbowl of soup and the whole party sat down to dinner. Arnold Jackson's\nremark seemed to have aroused in him a train of recollections, for he\nbegan to talk of his prison days. He talked quite naturally, without\nmalice, as though he were relating his experiences at a foreign\nuniversity. He addressed himself to Bateman and Bateman was confused and\nthen confounded. He saw Edward's eyes fixed on him and there was in them\na flicker of amusement. He blushed scarlet, for it struck him that\nJackson was making a fool of him, and then because he felt absurd--and\nknew there was no reason why he should--he grew angry. Arnold Jackson\nwas impudent--there was no other word for it--and his callousness,\nwhether assumed or not, was outrageous. The dinner proceeded. Bateman\nwas asked to eat sundry messes, raw fish and he knew not what, which\nonly his civility induced him to swallow, but which he was amazed to\nfind very good eating. Then an incident happened which to Bateman was\nthe most mortifying experience of the evening. There was a little\ncirclet of flowers in front of him, and for the sake of conversation he\nhazarded a remark about it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a wreath that Eva made for you,\" said Jackson, \"but I guess she\nwas too shy to give it you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman took it up in his hand and made a polite little speech of thanks\nto the girl.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must put it on,\" she said, with a smile and a blush.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I? I don't think I'll do that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's the charming custom of the country,\" said Arnold Jackson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was one in front of him and he placed it on his hair. Edward did\nthe same.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess I'm not dressed for the part,\" said Bateman, uneasily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would you like a pareo?\" said Eva quickly. \"I'll get you one in a\nminute.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, thank you. I'm quite comfortable as I am.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Show him how to put it on, Eva,\" said Edward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment Bateman hated his greatest friend. Eva got up from the\ntable and with much laughter placed the wreath on his black hair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It suits you very well,\" said Mrs. Jackson. \"Don't it suit him,\nArnold?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course it does.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman sweated at every pore.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Isn't it a pity it's dark?\" said Eva. \"We could photograph you all\nthree together.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman thanked his stars it was. He felt that he must look prodigiously\nfoolish in his blue serge suit and high collar--very neat and\ngentlemanly--with that ridiculous wreath of flowers on his head. He was\nseething with indignation, and he had never in his life exercised more\nself-control than now when he presented an affable exterior. He was\nfurious with that old man, sitting at the head of the table, half-naked,\nwith his saintly face and the flowers on his handsome white locks. The\nwhole position was monstrous.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen dinner came to an end, and Eva and her mother remained to clear\naway while the three men sat on the verandah. It was very warm and the\nair was scented with the white flowers of the night. The full moon,\nsailing across an unclouded sky, made a pathway on the broad sea that\nled to the boundless realms of Forever. Arnold Jackson began to talk.\nHis voice was rich and musical. He talked now of the natives and of the\nold legends of the country. He told strange stories of the past, stories\nof hazardous expeditions into the unknown, of love and death, of hatred\nand revenge. He told of the adventurers who had discovered those distant\nislands, of the sailors who, settling in them, had married the daughters\nof great chieftains, and of the beach-combers who had led their varied\nlives on those silvery shores. Bateman, mortified and exasperated, at\nfirst listened sullenly, but presently some magic in the words possessed\nhim and he sat entranced. The mirage of romance obscured the light of\ncommon day. Had he forgotten that Arnold Jackson had a tongue of silver,\na tongue by which he had charmed vast sums out of the credulous public,\na tongue which very nearly enabled him to escape the penalty of his\ncrimes? No one had a sweeter eloquence, and no one had a more acute\nsense of climax. Suddenly he rose.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you two boys haven't seen one another for a long time. I shall\nleave you to have a yarn. Teddie will show you your quarters when you\nwant to go to bed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, but I wasn't thinking of spending the night, Mr. Jackson,\" said\nBateman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll find it more comfortable. We'll see that you're called in good\ntime.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen with a courteous shake of the hand, stately as though he were a\nbishop in canonicals, Arnold Jackson took leave of his guest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I'll drive you back to Papeete if you like,\" said Edward,\n\"but I advise you to stay. It's bully driving in the early morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a few minutes neither of them spoke. Bateman wondered how he should\nbegin on the conversation which all the events of the day made him think\nmore urgent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When are you coming back to Chicago?\" he asked, suddenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a moment Edward did not answer. Then he turned rather lazily to look\nat his friend and smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. Perhaps never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What in heaven's name do you mean?\" cried Bateman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm very happy here. Wouldn't it be folly to make a change?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Man alive, you can't live here all your life. This is no life for a\nman. It's a living death. Oh, Edward, come away at once, before it's too\nlate. I've felt that something was wrong. You're infatuated with the\nplace, you've succumbed to evil influences, but it only requires a\nwrench, and when you're free from these surroundings you'll thank all\nthe gods there be. You'll be like a dope-fiend when he's broken from his\ndrug. You'll see then that for two years you've been breathing poisoned\nair. You can't imagine what a relief it will be when you fill your lungs\nonce more with the fresh, pure air of your native country.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe spoke quickly, the words tumbling over one another in his excitement,\nand there was in his voice sincere and affectionate emotion. Edward was\ntouched.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is good of you to care so much, old friend.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come with me to-morrow, Edward. It was a mistake that you ever came to\nthis place. This is no life for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You talk of this sort of life and that. How do you think a man gets the\nbest out of life?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, I should have thought there could be no two answers to that. By\ndoing his duty, by hard work, by meeting all the obligations of his\nstate and station.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what is his reward?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"His reward is the consciousness of having achieved what he set out to\ndo.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It all sounds a little portentous to me,\" said Edward, and in the\nlightness of the night Bateman could see that he was smiling. \"I'm\nafraid you'll think I've degenerated sadly. There are several things I\nthink now which I daresay would have seemed outrageous to me three years\nago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you learnt them from Arnold Jackson?\" asked Bateman, scornfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't like him? Perhaps you couldn't be expected to. I didn't when\nI first came. I had just the same prejudice as you. He's a very\nextraordinary man. You saw for yourself that he makes no secret of the\nfact that he was in a penitentiary. I do not know that he regrets it or\nthe crimes that led him there. The only complaint he ever made in my\nhearing was that when he came out his health was impaired. I think he\ndoes not know what remorse is. He is completely unmoral. He accepts\neverything and he accepts himself as well. He's generous and kind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He always was,\" interrupted Bateman, \"on other people's money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've found him a very good friend. Is it unnatural that I should take a\nman as I find him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The result is that you lose the distinction between right and wrong.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, they remain just as clearly divided in my mind as before, but what\nhas become a little confused in me is the distinction between the bad\nman and the good one. Is Arnold Jackson a bad man who does good things\nor a good man who does bad things? It's a difficult question to answer.\nPerhaps we make too much of the difference between one man and another.\nPerhaps even the best of us are sinners and the worst of us are saints.\nWho knows?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You will never persuade me that white is black and that black is\nwhite,\" said Bateman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sure I shan't, Bateman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman could not understand why the flicker of a smile crossed Edward's\nlips when he thus agreed with him. Edward was silent for a minute.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When I saw you this morning, Bateman,\" he said then, \"I seemed to see\nmyself as I was two years ago. The same collar, and the same shoes, the\nsame blue suit, the same energy. The same determination. By God, I was\nenergetic. The sleepy methods of this place made my blood tingle. I went\nabout and everywhere I saw possibilities for development and enterprise.\nThere were fortunes to be made here. It seemed to me absurd that the\ncopra should be taken away from here in sacks and the oil extracted in\nAmerica. It would be far more economical to do all that on the spot,\nwith cheap labour, and save freight, and I saw already the vast\nfactories springing up on the island. Then the way they extracted it\nfrom the coconut seemed to me hopelessly inadequate, and I invented a\nmachine which divided the nut and scooped out the meat at the rate of\ntwo hundred and forty an hour. The harbour was not large enough. I made\nplans to enlarge it, then to form a syndicate to buy land, put up two or\nthree large hotels, and bungalows for occasional residents; I had a\nscheme for improving the steamer service in order to attract visitors\nfrom California. In twenty years, instead of this half-French, lazy\nlittle town of Papeete I saw a great American city with ten-storey\nbuildings and street-cars, a theatre and an opera house, a stock\nexchange and a mayor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But go ahead, Edward,\" cried Bateman, springing up from the chair in\nexcitement. \"You've got the ideas and the capacity. Why, you'll become\nthe richest man between Australia and the States.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEdward chuckled softly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I don't want to,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean to say you don't want money, big money, money running into\nmillions? Do you know what you can do with it? Do you know the power it\nbrings? And if you don't care about it for yourself think what you can\ndo, opening new channels for human enterprise, giving occupation to\nthousands. My brain reels at the visions your words have conjured up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sit down, then, my dear Bateman,\" laughed Edward. \"My machine for\ncutting the coconuts will always remain unused, and so far as I'm\nconcerned street-cars shall never run in the idle streets of Papeete.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman sank heavily into his chair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't understand you,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It came upon me little by little. I came to like the life here, with\nits ease and its leisure, and the people, with their good-nature and\ntheir happy smiling faces. I began to think. I'd never had time to do\nthat before. I began to read.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You always read.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I read for examinations. I read in order to be able to hold my own in\nconversation. I read for instruction. Here I learned to read for\npleasure. I learned to talk. Do you know that conversation is one of the\ngreatest pleasures in life? But it wants leisure. I'd always been too\nbusy before. And gradually all the life that had seemed so important to\nme began to seem rather trivial and vulgar. What is the use of all this\nhustle and this constant striving? I think of Chicago now and I see a\ndark, grey city, all stone--it is like a prison--and a ceaseless\nturmoil. And what does all that activity amount to? Does one get there\nthe best out of life? Is that what we come into the world for, to hurry\nto an office, and work hour after hour till night, then hurry home and\ndine and go to a theatre? Is that how I must spend my youth? Youth lasts\nso short a time, Bateman. And when I am old, what have I to look forward\nto? To hurry from my home in the morning to my office and work hour\nafter hour till night, and then hurry home again, and dine and go to a\ntheatre? That may be worth while if you make a fortune; I don't know, it\ndepends on your nature; but if you don't, is it worth while then? I want\nto make more out of my life than that, Bateman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you value in life then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid you'll laugh at me. Beauty, truth, and goodness.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you think you can have those in Chicago?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Some men can, perhaps, but not I.\" Edward sprang up now. \"I tell you\nwhen I think of the life I led in the old days I am filled with horror,\"\nhe cried violently. \"I tremble with fear when I think of the danger I\nhave escaped. I never knew I had a soul till I found it here. If I had\nremained a rich man I might have lost it for good and all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know how you can say that,\" cried Baseman indignantly. \"We\noften used to have discussions about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I know. They were about as effectual as the discussions of deaf\nmutes about harmony. I shall never come back to Chicago, Bateman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what about Isabel?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEdward walked to the edge of the verandah and leaning over looked\nintently at the blue magic of the night. There was a slight smile on his\nface when he turned back to Bateman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Isabel is infinitely too good for me. I admire her more than any woman\nI have ever known. She has a wonderful brain and she's as good as she's\nbeautiful. I respect her energy and her ambition. She was born to make a\nsuccess of life. I am entirely unworthy of her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She doesn't think so.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But you must tell her so, Bateman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I?\" cried Bateman. \"I'm the last person who could ever do that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEdward had his back to the vivid light of the moon and his face could\nnot be seen. Is it possible that he smiled again?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's no good your trying to conceal anything from her, Bateman. With\nher quick intelligence she'll turn you inside out in five minutes. You'd\nbetter make a clean breast of it right away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what you mean. Of course I shall tell her I've seen you.\"\nBateman spoke in some agitation. \"Honestly I don't know what to say to\nher.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell her that I haven't made good. Tell her that I'm not only poor, but\nthat I'm content to be poor. Tell her I was fired from my job because I\nwas idle and inattentive. Tell her all you've seen to-night and all I've\ntold you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe idea which on a sudden flashed through Bateman's brain brought him\nto his feet and in uncontrollable perturbation he faced Edward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Man alive, don't you want to marry her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEdward looked at him gravely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can never ask her to release me. If she wishes to hold me to my word\nI will do my best to make her a good and loving husband.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you wish me to give her that message, Edward? Oh, I can't. It's\nterrible. It's never dawned on her for a moment that you don't want to\nmarry her. She loves you. How can I inflict such a mortification on\nher?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEdward smiled again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why don't you marry her yourself, Bateman? You've been in love with her\nfor ages. You're perfectly suited to one another. You'll make her very\nhappy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't talk to me like that. I can't bear it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I resign in your favour, Bateman. You are the better man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was something in Edward's tone that made Bateman look up quickly,\nbut Edward's eyes were grave and unsmiling. Bateman did not know what to\nsay. He was disconcerted. He wondered whether Edward could possibly\nsuspect that he had come to Tahiti on a special errand. And though he\nknew it was horrible he could not prevent the exultation in his heart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What will you do if Isabel writes and puts an end to her engagement\nwith you?\" he said, slowly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Survive,\" said Edward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman was so agitated that he did not hear the answer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish you had ordinary clothes on,\" he said, somewhat irritably. \"It's\nsuch a tremendously serious decision you're taking. That fantastic\ncostume of yours makes it seem terribly casual.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I assure you, I can be just as solemn in a pareo and a wreath of roses,\nas in a high hat and a cut-away coat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen another thought struck Bateman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Edward, it's not for my sake you're doing this? I don't know, but\nperhaps this is going to make a tremendous difference to my future.\nYou're not sacrificing yourself for me? I couldn't stand for that, you\nknow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, Bateman, I have learnt not to be silly and sentimental here. I\nshould like you and Isabel to be happy, but I have not the least wish to\nbe unhappy myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe answer somewhat chilled Bateman. It seemed to him a little cynical.\nHe would not have been sorry to act a noble part.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean to say you're content to waste your life here? It's nothing\nless than suicide. When I think of the great hopes you had when we left\ncollege it seems terrible that you should be content to be no more than\na salesman in a cheap-John store.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I'm only doing that for the present, and I'm gaining a great deal\nof valuable experience. I have another plan in my head. Arnold Jackson\nhas a small island in the Paumotas, about a thousand miles from here, a\nring of land round a lagoon. He's planted coconut there. He's offered to\ngive it to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why should he do that?\" asked Bateman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Because if Isabel releases me I shall marry his daughter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You?\" Bateman was thunderstuck. \"You can't marry a half-caste. You\nwouldn't be so crazy as that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's a good girl, and she has a sweet and gentle nature. I think she\nwould make me very happy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you in love with her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know,\" answered Edward reflectively. \"I'm not in love with her\nas I was in love with Isabel. I worshipped Isabel. I thought she was the\nmost wonderful creature I had ever seen. I was not half good enough for\nher. I don't feel like that with Eva. She's like a beautiful exotic\nflower that must be sheltered from bitter winds. I want to protect her.\nNo one ever thought of protecting Isabel. I think she loves me for\nmyself and not for what I may become. Whatever happens to me I shall\nnever disappoint her. She suits me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman was silent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We must turn out early in the morning,\" said Edward at last. \"It's\nreally about time we went to bed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen Bateman spoke and his voice had in it a genuine distress.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm so bewildered, I don't know what to say. I came here because I\nthought something was wrong. I thought you hadn't succeeded in what you\nset out to do and were ashamed to come back when you'd failed. I never\nguessed I should be faced with this. I'm so desperately sorry, Edward.\nI'm so disappointed. I hoped you would do great things. It's almost more\nthan I can bear to think of you wasting your talents and your youth and\nyour chance in this lamentable way.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be grieved, old friend,\" said Edward. \"I haven't failed. I've\nsucceeded. You can't think with what zest I look forward to life, how\nfull it seems to me and how significant. Sometimes, when you are married\nto Isabel, you will think of me. I shall build myself a house on my\ncoral island and I shall live there, looking after my trees--getting the\nfruit out of the nuts in the same old way that they have done for\nunnumbered years--I shall grow all sorts of things in my garden, and I\nshall fish. There will be enough work to keep me busy and not enough to\nmake me dull. I shall have my books and Eva, children, I hope, and above\nall, the infinite variety of the sea and the sky, the freshness of the\ndawn and the beauty of the sunset, and the rich magnificence of the\nnight. I shall make a garden out of what so short a while ago was a\nwilderness. I shall have created something. The years will pass\ninsensibly, and when I am an old man I hope that I shall be able to look\nback on a happy, simple, peaceful life. In my small way I too shall have\nlived in beauty. Do you think it is so little to have enjoyed\ncontentment? We know that it will profit a man little if he gain the\nwhole world and lose his soul. I think I have won mine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEdward led him to a room in which there were two beds and he threw\nhimself on one of them. In ten minutes Bateman knew by his regular\nbreathing, peaceful as a child's, that Edward was asleep. But for his\npart he had no rest, he was disturbed in mind, and it was not till the\ndawn crept into the room, ghostlike and silent, that he fell asleep.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman finished telling Isabel his long story. He had hidden nothing\nfrom her except what he thought would wound her or what made himself\nridiculous. He did not tell her that he had been forced to sit at dinner\nwith a wreath of flowers round his head and he did not tell her that\nEdward was prepared to marry her uncle's half-caste daughter the moment\nshe set him free. But perhaps Isabel had keener intuitions than he knew,\nfor as he went on with his tale her eyes grew colder and her lips closed\nupon one another more tightly. Now and then she looked at him closely,\nand if he had been less intent on his narrative he might have wondered\nat her expression.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What was this girl like?\" she asked when he finished. \"Uncle Arnold's\ndaughter. Would you say there was any resemblance between her and me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBateman was surprised at the question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It never struck me. You know I've never had eyes for anyone but you and\nI could never think that anyone was like you. Who could resemble you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Was she pretty?\" said Isabel, smiling slightly at his words.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose so. I daresay some men would say she was very beautiful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it's of no consequence. I don't think we need give her any more\nof our attention.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do, Isabel?\" he asked then.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIsabel looked down at the hand which still bore the ring Edward had\ngiven her on their betrothal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't let Edward break our engagement because I thought it would\nbe an incentive to him. I wanted to be an inspiration to him. I thought\nif anything could enable him to achieve success it was the thought that\nI loved him. I have done all I could. It's hopeless. It would only be\nweakness on my party not to recognise the facts. Poor Edward, he's\nnobody's enemy but his own. He was a dear, nice fellow, but there was\nsomething lacking in him, I suppose it was backbone. I hope he'll be\nhappy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe slipped the ring off her finger and placed it on the table. Bateman\nwatched her with a heart beating so rapidly that he could hardly\nbreathe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're wonderful, Isabel, you're simply wonderful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe smiled, and, standing up, held out her hand to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How can I ever thank you for what you've done for me?\" she said. \"You\nhave done me a great service. I knew I could trust you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took her hand and held it. She had never looked more beautiful.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Isabel, I would do so much more for you than that. You know that I\nonly ask to be allowed to love and serve you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're so strong, Bateman,\" she sighed. \"It gives me such a delicious\nfeeling of confidence.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Isabel, I adore you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe hardly knew how the inspiration had come to him, but suddenly he\nclasped her in his arms; she, all unresisting, smiled into his eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Isabel, you know I wanted to marry you the very first day I saw you,\"\nhe cried passionately.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then why on earth didn't you ask me?\" she replied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe loved him. He could hardly believe it was true. She gave him her\nlovely lips to kiss. And as he held her in his arms he had a vision of\nthe works of the Hunter Motor Traction and Automobile Company growing in\nsize and importance till they covered a hundred acres, and of the\nmillions of motors they would turn out, and of the great collection of\npictures he would form which should beat anything they had in New York.\nHe would wear horn spectacles. And she, with the delicious pressure of\nhis arms about her, sighed with happiness, for she thought of the\nexquisite house she would have, full of antique furniture, and of the\nconcerts she would give, and of the <i>thés dansants</i>, and the dinners to\nwhich only the most cultured people would come.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor Edward,\" she sighed.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThe wise traveller travels only in imagination. An old Frenchman (he was\nreally a Savoyard) once wrote a book called <i>Voyage autour de ma\nChambre</i>. I have not read it and do not even know what it is about, but\nthe title stimulates my fancy. In such a journey I could circumnavigate\nthe globe. An eikon by the chimneypiece can take me to Russia with its\ngreat forests of birch and its white, domed churches. The Volga is wide,\nand at the end of a straggling village, in the wine-shop, bearded men in\nrough sheepskin coats sit drinking. I stand on the little hill from\nwhich Napoleon first saw Moscow and I look upon the vastness of the\ncity. I will go down and see the people whom I know more intimately than\nso many of my friends, Alyosha, and Vronsky, and a dozen more. But my\neyes fall on a piece of porcelain and I smell the acrid odours of China.\nI am borne in a chair along a narrow causeway between the padi fields,\nor else I skirt a tree-clad mountain. My bearers chat gaily as they\ntrudge along in the bright morning and every now and then, distant and\nmysterious, I hear the deep sound of a monastery bell. In the streets of\nPeking there is a motley crowd and it scatters to allow passage to a\nstring of camels, stepping delicately, that bring skins and strange\ndrugs from the stony deserts of Mongolia. In England, in London, there\nare certain afternoons in winter when the clouds hang heavy and low and\nthe light is so bleak that your heart sinks, but then you can look out\nof your window, and you see the coconut trees crowded upon the beach of\na coral island. The strand is silvery and when you walk along in the\nsunshine it is so dazzling that you can hardly bear to look at it.\nOverhead the mynah birds are making a great to-do, and the surf beats\nceaselessly against the reef. Those are the best journeys, the journeys\nthat you take at your own fireside, for then you lose none of your\nillusions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut there are people who take salt in their coffee. They say it gives it\na tang, a savour, which is peculiar and fascinating. In the same way\nthere are certain places, surrounded by a halo of romance, to which the\ninevitable disillusionment which you must experience on seeing them\ngives a singular spice. You had expected something wholly beautiful and\nyou get an impression which is infinitely more complicated than any that\nbeauty can give you. It is like the weakness in the character of a great\nman which may make him less admirable but certainly makes him more\ninteresting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNothing had prepared me for Honolulu. It is so far away from Europe, it\nis reached after so long a journey from San Francisco, so strange and so\ncharming associations are attached to the name, that at first I could\nhardly believe my eyes. I do not know that I had formed in my mind any\nvery exact picture of what I expected, but what I found caused me a\ngreat surprise. It is a typical western city. Shacks are cheek by jowl\nwith stone mansions: dilapidated frame houses stand next door to smart\nstores with plate-glass windows; electric cars rumble noisily along the\nstreets; and motors, Fords, Buicks, Packards, line the pavement. The\nshops are filled with all the necessities of American civilisation.\nEvery third house is a bank and every fifth the agency of a steamship\ncompany.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlong the streets crowd an unimaginable assortment of people. The\nAmericans, ignoring the climate, wear black coats and high, starched\ncollars, straw hats, soft hats, and bowlers. The Kanakas, pale brown,\nwith crisp hair, have nothing on but a shirt and a pair of trousers; but\nthe half-breeds are very smart with flaring ties and patent-leather\nboots. The Japanese, with their obsequious smile, are neat and trim in\nwhite duck, while their women walk a step or two behind them, in native\ndress, with a baby on their backs. The Japanese children, in bright\ncoloured frocks, their little heads shaven, look like quaint dolls. Then\nthere are the Chinese. The men, fat and prosperous, wear their American\nclothes oddly, but the women are enchanting with their tightly-dressed\nblack hair, so neat that you feel it can never be disarranged, and they\nare very clean in their tunics and trousers, white, or powder-blue, or\nblack. Lastly there are the Filipinos, the men in huge straw hats, the\nwomen in bright yellow muslin with great puffed sleeves.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt is the meeting-place of East and West. The very new rubs shoulders\nwith the immeasurably old. And if you have not found the romance you\nexpected you have come upon something singularly intriguing. All these\nstrange people live close to each other, with different languages and\ndifferent thoughts; they believe in different gods and they have\ndifferent values; two passions alone they share, love and hunger. And\nsomehow as you watch them you have an impression of extraordinary\nvitality. Though the air is so soft and the sky so blue, you have, I\nknow not why, a feeling of something hotly passionate that beats like a\nthrobbing pulse through the crowd. Though the native policeman at the\ncorner, standing on a platform, with a white club to direct the traffic,\ngives the scene an air of respectability, you cannot but feel that it is\na respectability only of the surface; a little below there is darkness\nand mystery. It gives you just that thrill, with a little catch at the\nheart, that you have when at night in the forest the silence trembles on\na sudden with the low, insistent beating of a drum. You are all\nexpectant of I know not what.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIf I have dwelt on the incongruity of Honolulu, it is because just this,\nto my mind, gives its point to the story I want to tell. It is a story\nof primitive superstition, and it startles me that anything of the sort\nshould survive in a civilisation which, if not very distinguished, is\ncertainly very elaborate. I cannot get over the fact that such\nincredible things should happen, or at least be thought to happen, right\nin the middle, so to speak, of telephones, tram-cars, and daily papers.\nAnd the friend who showed me Honolulu had the same incongruity which I\nfelt from the beginning was its most striking characteristic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was an American named Winter and I had brought a letter of\nintroduction to him from an acquaintance in New York. He was a man\nbetween forty and fifty, with scanty black hair, grey at the temples,\nand a sharp-featured, thin face. His eyes had a twinkle in them and his\nlarge horn spectacles gave him a demureness which was not a little\ndiverting. He was tall rather than otherwise and very spare. He was born\nin Honolulu and his father had a large store which sold hosiery and all\nsuch goods, from tennis racquets to tarpaulins, as a man of fashion\ncould require. It was a prosperous business and I could well understand\nthe indignation of Winter <i>père</i> when his son, refusing to go into it,\nhad announced his determination to be an actor. My friend spent twenty\nyears on the stage, sometimes in New York, but more often on the road,\nfor his gifts were small; but at last, being no fool, he came to the\nconclusion that it was better to sell sock-suspenders in Honolulu than\nto play small parts in Cleveland, Ohio. He left the stage and went into\nthe business. I think after the hazardous existence he had lived so\nlong, he thoroughly enjoyed the luxury of driving a large car and living\nin a beautiful house near the golf-course, and I am quite sure, since he\nwas a man of parts, he managed the business competently. But he could\nnot bring himself entirely to break his connection with the arts and\nsince he might no longer act he began to paint. He took me to his studio\nand showed me his work. It was not at all bad, but not what I should\nhave expected from him. He painted nothing but still life, very small\npictures, perhaps eight by ten; and he painted very delicately, with the\nutmost finish. He had evidently a passion for detail. His fruit pieces\nreminded you of the fruit in a picture by Ghirlandajo. While you\nmarvelled a little at his patience, you could not help being impressed\nby his dexterity. I imagine that he failed as an actor because his\neffects, carefully studied, were neither bold nor broad enough to get\nacross the footlights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was entertained by the proprietary, yet ironical air with which he\nshowed me the city. He thought in his heart that there was none in the\nUnited States to equal it, but he saw quite clearly that his attitude\nwas comic. He drove me round to the various buildings and swelled with\nsatisfaction when I expressed a proper admiration for their\narchitecture. He showed me the houses of rich men.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's the Stubbs' house,\" he said. \"It cost a hundred thousand dollars\nto build. The Stubbses are one of our best families. Old man Stubbs came\nhere as a missionary more than seventy years ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe hesitated a little and looked at me with twinkling eyes through his\nbig round spectacles.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All our best families are missionary families,\" he said. \"You're not\nvery much in Honolulu unless your father or your grandfather converted\nthe heathen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is that so?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you know your Bible?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fairly,\" I answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is a text which says: The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the\nchildren's teeth are set on edge. I guess it runs differently in\nHonolulu. The fathers brought Christianity to the Kanaka and the\nchildren jumped his land.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Heaven helps those who help themselves,\" I murmured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It surely does. By the time the natives of this island had embraced\nChristianity they had nothing else they could afford to embrace. The\nkings gave the missionaries land as a mark of esteem, and the\nmissionaries bought land by way of laying up treasure in heaven. It\nsurely was a good investment. One missionary left the business--I think\none may call it a business without offence--and became a land agent, but\nthat is an exception. Mostly it was their sons who looked after the\ncommercial side of the concern. Oh, it's a fine thing to have a father\nwho came here fifty years ago to spread the faith.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he looked at his watch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gee, it's stopped. That means it's time to have a cocktail.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe sped along an excellent road, bordered with red hibiscus, and came\nback into the town.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you been to the Union Saloon?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not yet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'll go there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI knew it was the most famous spot in Honolulu and I entered it with a\nlively curiosity. You get to it by a narrow passage from King Street,\nand in the passage are offices, so that thirsty souls may be supposed\nbound for one of these just as well as for the saloon. It is a large\nsquare room, with three entrances, and opposite the bar, which runs the\nlength of it, two corners have been partitioned off into little\ncubicles. Legend states that they were built so that King Kalakaua might\ndrink there without being seen by his subjects, and it is pleasant to\nthink that in one or other of these he may have sat over his bottle, a\ncoal-black potentate, with Robert Louis Stevenson. There is a portrait\nof him, in oils, in a rich gold frame; but there are also two prints of\nQueen Victoria. On the walls, besides, are old line engravings of the\neighteenth century, one of which, and heaven knows how it got there, is\nafter a theatrical picture by De Wilde; and there are oleographs from\nthe Christmas supplements of the <i>Graphic</i> and the <i>Illustrated London\nNews</i> of twenty years ago. Then there are advertisements of whisky, gin,\nchampagne, and beer; and photographs of baseball teams and of native\norchestras.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe place seemed to belong not to the modern, hustling world that I had\nleft in the bright street outside, but to one that was dying. It had the\nsavour of the day before yesterday. Dingy and dimly lit, it had a\nvaguely mysterious air and you could imagine that it would be a fit\nscene for shady transactions. It suggested a more lurid time, when\nruthless men carried their lives in their hands, and violent deeds\ndiapered the monotony of life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen I went in, the saloon was fairly full. A group of business men\nstood together at the bar, discussing affairs, and in a corner two\nKanakas were drinking. Two or three men who might have been\nstore-keepers were shaking dice. The rest of the company plainly\nfollowed the sea; they were captains of tramps, first mates, and\nengineers. Behind the bar, busily making the Honolulu cocktail for which\nthe place was famous, served two large half-castes, in white, fat,\nclean-shaven and dark-skinned, with thick, curly hair and large bright\neyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWinter seemed to know more than half the company, and when we made our\nway to the bar a little fat man in spectacles, who was standing by\nhimself, offered him a drink.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, you have one with me, Captain,\" said Winter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want you to know Captain Butler.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe little man shook hands with me. We began to talk, but, my attention\ndistracted by my surroundings, I took small notice of him, and after we\nhad each ordered a cocktail we separated. When we had got into the motor\nagain and were driving away, Winter said to me:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm glad we ran up against Butler. I wanted you to meet him. What did\nyou think of him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know that I thought very much of him at all,\" I answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you believe in the supernatural?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't exactly know that I do,\" I smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A very queer thing happened to him a year or two ago. You ought to have\nhim tell you about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What sort of thing?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWinter did not answer my question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have no explanation of it myself,\" he said. \"But there's no doubt\nabout the facts. Are you interested in things like that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Things like what?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Spells and magic and all that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've never met anyone who wasn't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWinter paused for a moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess I won't tell you myself. You ought to hear it from his own lips\nso that you can judge. How are you fixed up for to-night?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got nothing on at all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'll get hold of him between now and then and see if we can't go\ndown to his ship.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWinter told me something about him. Captain Butler had spent all his\nlife on the Pacific. He had been in much better circumstances than he\nwas now, for he had been first officer and then captain of a\npassenger-boat plying along the coast of California, but he had lost his\nship and a number of passengers had been drowned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Drink, I guess,\" said Winter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course there had been an enquiry, which had cost him his certificate,\nand then he drifted further afield. For some years he had knocked about\nthe South Seas, but he was now in command of a small schooner which\nsailed between Honolulu and the various islands of the group. It\nbelonged to a Chinese to whom the fact that his skipper had no\ncertificate meant only that he could be had for lower wages, and to have\na white man in charge was always an advantage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd now that I had heard this about him I took the trouble to remember\nmore exactly what he was like. I recalled his round spectacles and the\nround blue eyes behind them, and so gradually reconstructed him before\nmy mind. He was a little man, without angles, plump, with a round face\nlike the full moon and a little fat round nose. He had fair short hair,\nand he was red-faced and clean-shaven. He had plump hands, dimpled on\nthe knuckles, and short fat legs. He was a jolly soul, and the tragic\nexperience he had gone through seemed to have left him unscarred. Though\nhe must have been thirty-four or thirty-five he looked much younger. But\nafter all I had given him but a superficial attention, and now that I\nknew of this catastrophe, which had obviously ruined his life, I\npromised myself that when I saw him again I would take more careful note\nof him. It is very curious to observe the differences of emotional\nresponse that you find in different people. Some can go through terrible\nbattles, the fear of imminent death and unimaginable horrors, and\npreserve their soul unscathed, while with others the trembling of the\nmoon on a solitary sea or the song of a bird in a thicket will cause a\nconvulsion great enough to transform their entire being. Is it due to\nstrength or weakness, want of imagination or instability of character? I\ndo not know. When I called up in my fancy that scene of shipwreck, with\nthe shrieks of the drowning and the terror, and then later, the ordeal\nof the enquiry, the bitter grief of those who sorrowed for the lost, and\nthe harsh things he must have read of himself in the papers, the shame\nand the disgrace, it came to me with a shock to remember that Captain\nButler had talked with the frank obscenity of a schoolboy of the\nHawaiian girls and of Iwelei, the Red Light district, and of his\nsuccessful adventures. He laughed readily, and one would have thought he\ncould never laugh again. I remembered his shining, white teeth; they\nwere his best feature. He began to interest me, and thinking of him and\nof his gay insouciance I forgot the particular story, to hear which I\nwas to see him again. I wanted to see him rather to find out if I could\na little more what sort of man he was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWinter made the necessary arrangements and after dinner we went down to\nthe water front. The ship's boat was waiting for us and we rowed out.\nThe schooner was anchored some way across the harbour, not far from the\nbreakwater. We came alongside, and I heard the sound of a ukalele. We\nclambered up the ladder.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess he's in the cabin,\" said Winter, leading the way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a small cabin, bedraggled and dirty, with a table against one\nside and a broad bench all round upon which slept, I supposed, such\npassengers as were ill-advised enough to travel in such a ship. A\npetroleum lamp gave a dim light. The ukalele was being played by a\nnative girl and Butler was lolling on the seat, half lying, with his\nhead on her shoulder and an arm round her waist.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't let us disturb you, Captain,\" said Winter, facetiously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come right in,\" said Butler, getting up and shaking hands with us.\n\"What'll you have?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a warm night, and through the open door you saw countless stars\nin a heaven that was still almost blue. Captain Butler wore a sleeveless\nundershirt, showing his fat white arms, and a pair of incredibly dirty\ntrousers. His feet were bare, but on his curly head he wore a very old,\na very shapeless felt hat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me introduce you to my girl. Ain't she a peach?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe shook hands with a very pretty person. She was a good deal taller\nthan the captain, and even the Mother Hubbard, which the missionaries of\na past generation had, in the interests of decency, forced on the\nunwilling natives, could not conceal the beauty of her form. One could\nnot but suspect that age would burden her with a certain corpulence, but\nnow she was graceful and alert. Her brown skin had an exquisite\ntranslucency and her eyes were magnificent. Her black hair, very thick\nand rich, was coiled round her head in a massive plait. When she smiled\nin a greeting that was charmingly natural, she showed teeth that were\nsmall, even, and white. She was certainly a most attractive creature. It\nwas easy to see that the captain was madly in love with her. He could\nnot take his eyes off her; he wanted to touch her all the time. That was\nvery easy to understand; but what seemed to me stranger was that the\ngirl was apparently in love with him. There was a light in her eyes that\nwas unmistakable, and her lips were slightly parted as though in a sigh\nof desire. It was thrilling. It was even a little moving, and I could\nnot help feeling somewhat in the way. What had a stranger to do with\nthis lovesick pair? I wished that Winter had not brought me. And it\nseemed to me that the dingy cabin was transfigured and now it seemed a\nfit and proper scene for such an extremity of passion. I thought I\nshould never forget that schooner in the harbour of Honolulu, crowded\nwith shipping, and yet, under the immensity of the starry sky, remote\nfrom all the world. I liked to think of those lovers sailing off\ntogether in the night over the empty spaces of the Pacific from one\ngreen, hilly island to another. A faint breeze of romance softly fanned\nmy cheek.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd yet Butler was the last man in the world with whom you would have\nassociated romance, and it was hard to see what there was in him to\narouse love. In the clothes he wore now he looked podgier than ever, and\nhis round spectacles gave his round face the look of a prim cherub. He\nsuggested rather a curate who had gone to the dogs. His conversation was\npeppered with the quaintest Americanisms, and it is because I despair of\nreproducing these that, at whatever loss of vividness, I mean to narrate\nthe story he told me a little later in my own words. Moreover he was\nunable to frame a sentence without an oath, though a good-natured one,\nand his speech, albeit offensive only to prudish ears, in print would\nseem coarse. He was a mirth-loving man, and perhaps that accounted not a\nlittle for his successful amours; since women, for the most part\nfrivolous creatures, are excessively bored by the seriousness with which\nmen treat them, and they can seldom resist the buffoon who makes them\nlaugh. Their sense of humour is crude. Diana of Ephesus is always\nprepared to fling prudence to the winds for the red-nosed comedian who\nsits on his hat. I realised that Captain Butler had charm. If I had not\nknown the tragic story of the shipwreck I should have thought he had\nnever had a care in his life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOur host had rung the bell on our entrance and now a Chinese cook came\nin with more glasses and several bottles of soda. The whisky and the\ncaptain's empty glass stood already on the table. But when I saw the\nChinese I positively started, for he was certainly the ugliest man I had\never seen. He was very short, but thick-set, and he had a bad limp. He\nwore a singlet and a pair of trousers that had been white, but were now\nfilthy, and, perched on a shock of bristly, grey hair, an old tweed\ndeer-stalker. It would have been grotesque on any Chinese, but on him it\nwas outrageous. His broad, square face was very flat as though it had\nbeen bashed in by a mighty fist, and it was deeply pitted with smallpox;\nbut the most revolting thing in him was a very pronounced harelip which\nhad never been operated on, so that his upper lip, cleft, went up in an\nangle to his nose, and in the opening was a huge yellow fang. It was\nhorrible. He came in with the end of a cigarette at the corner of his\nmouth and this, I do not know why, gave him a devilish expression.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe poured out the whisky and opened a bottle of soda.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't drown it, John,\" said the captain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe said nothing, but handed a glass to each of us. Then he went out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I saw you lookin' at my Chink,\" said Butler, with a grin on his fat,\nshining face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should hate to meet him on a dark night,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He sure is homely,\" said the captain, and for some reason he seemed to\nsay it with a peculiar satisfaction. \"But he's fine for one thing, I'll\ntell the world; you just have to have a drink every time you look at\nhim.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut my eyes fell on a calabash that hung against the wall over the\ntable, and I got up to look at it. I had been hunting for an old one and\nthis was better than any I had seen outside the museum.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was given me by a chief over on one of the islands,\" said the\ncaptain, watching me. \"I done him a good turn and he wanted to give me\nsomething good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He certainly did,\" I answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was wondering whether I could discreetly make Captain Butler an offer\nfor it, I could not imagine that he set any store on such an article,\nwhen, as though he read my thoughts, he said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't sell that for ten thousand dollars.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess not,\" said Winter. \"It would be a crime to sell it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That comes into the story,\" returned Winter. \"Doesn't it, Captain?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It surely does.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let's hear it then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The night's young yet,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe night distinctly lost its youth before he satisfied my curiosity,\nand meanwhile we drank a great deal too much whisky while Captain Butler\nnarrated his experiences of San Francisco in the old days and of the\nSouth Seas. At last the girl fell asleep. She lay curled up on the seat,\nwith her face on her brown arm, and her bosom rose and fell gently with\nher breathing. In sleep she looked sullen, but darkly beautiful.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had found her on one of the islands in the group among which,\nwhenever there was cargo to be got, he wandered with his crazy old\nschooner. The Kanakas have little love for work, and the laborious\nChinese, the cunning Japs, have taken the trade out of their hands. Her\nfather had a strip of land on which he grew taro and bananas and he had\na boat in which he went fishing. He was vaguely related to the mate of\nthe schooner, and it was he who took Captain Butler up to the shabby\nlittle frame house to spend an idle evening. They took a bottle of\nwhisky with them and the ukalele. The captain was not a shy man and when\nhe saw a pretty girl he made love to her. He could speak the native\nlanguage fluently and it was not long before he had overcome the girl's\ntimidity. They spent the evening singing and dancing, and by the end of\nit she was sitting by his side and he had his arm round her waist. It\nhappened that they were delayed on the island for several days and the\ncaptain, at no time a man to hurry, made no effort to shorten his stay.\nHe was very comfortable in the snug little harbour and life was long. He\nhad a swim round his ship in the morning and another in the evening.\nThere was a chandler's shop on the water front where sailormen could get\na drink of whisky, and he spent the best part of the day there, playing\ncribbage with the half-caste who owned it. At night the mate and he went\nup to the house where the pretty girl lived and they sang a song or two\nand told stories. It was the girl's father who suggested that he should\ntake her away with him. They discussed the matter in a friendly fashion,\nwhile the girl, nestling against the captain, urged him by the pressure\nof her hands and her soft smiling glances. He had taken a fancy to her\nand he was a domestic man. He was a little dull sometimes at sea and it\nwould be very pleasant to have a pretty little creature like that about\nthe old ship. He was of a practical turn too, and he recognised that it\nwould be useful to have someone around to darn his socks and look after\nhis linen. He was tired of having his things washed by a Chink who tore\neverything to pieces; the natives washed much better, and now and then\nwhen the captain went ashore at Honolulu he liked to cut a dash in a\nsmart duck suit. It was only a matter of arranging a price. The father\nwanted two hundred and fifty dollars, and the captain, never a thrifty\nman, could not put his hand on such a sum. But he was a generous one,\nand with the girl's soft face against his, he was not inclined to\nhaggle. He offered to give a hundred and fifty dollars there and then\nand another hundred in three months. There was a good deal of argument\nand the parties could not come to any agreement that night, but the idea\nhad fired the captain, and he could not sleep as well as usual. He kept\ndreaming of the lovely girl and each time he awoke it was with the\npressure of her soft, sensual lips on his. He cursed himself in the\nmorning because a bad night at poker the last time he was at Honolulu\nhad left him so short of ready money. And if the night before he had\nbeen in love with the girl, this morning he was crazy about her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"See here, Bananas,\" he said to the mate, \"I've got to have that girl.\nYou go and tell the old man I'll bring the dough up to-night and she can\nget fixed up. I figure we'll be ready to sail at dawn.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI have no idea why the mate was known by that eccentric name. He was\ncalled Wheeler, but though he had that English surname there was not a\ndrop of white blood in him. He was a tall man, and well-made though\ninclined to stoutness, but much darker than is usual in Hawaii. He was\nno longer young, and his crisply curling, thick hair was grey. His upper\nfront teeth were cased in gold. He was very proud of them. He had a\nmarked squint and this gave him a saturnine expression. The captain, who\nwas fond of a joke, found in it a constant source of humour and\nhesitated the less to rally him on the defect because he realised that\nthe mate was sensitive about it. Bananas, unlike most of the natives,\nwas a taciturn fellow and Captain Butler would have disliked him if it\nhad been possible for a man of his good nature to dislike anyone. He\nliked to be at sea with someone he could talk to, he was a chatty,\nsociable creature, and it was enough to drive a missionary to drink to\nlive there day after day with a chap who never opened his mouth. He did\nhis best to wake the mate up, that is to say, he chaffed him without\nmercy, but it was poor fun to laugh by oneself, and he came to the\nconclusion that, drunk or sober, Bananas was no fit companion for a\nwhite man. But he was a good seaman and the captain was shrewd enough to\nknow the value of a mate he could trust. It was not rare for him to come\naboard, when they were sailing, fit for nothing but to fall into his\nbunk, and it was worth something to know that he could stay there till\nhe had slept his liquor off, since Bananas could be relied on. But he\nwas an unsociable devil, and it would be a treat to have someone he\ncould talk to. That girl would be fine. Besides, he wouldn't be so\nlikely to get drunk when he went ashore if he knew there was a little\ngirl waiting for him when he came on board again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went to his friend the chandler and over a peg of gin asked him for a\nloan. There were one or two useful things a ship's captain could do for\na ship's chandler, and after a quarter of an hour's conversation in low\ntones (there is no object in letting all and sundry know your business),\nthe captain crammed a wad of notes in his hip-pocket, and that night,\nwhen he went back to his ship, the girl went with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhat Captain Butler, seeking for reasons to do what he had already made\nup his mind to, had anticipated, actually came to pass. He did not give\nup drinking, but he ceased to drink to excess. An evening with the boys,\nwhen he had been away from town two or three weeks, was pleasant enough,\nbut it was pleasant too to get back to his little girl; he thought of\nher, sleeping so softly, and how, when he got into his cabin and leaned\nover her, she would open her eyes lazily and stretch out her arms for\nhim: it was as good as a full hand. He found he was saving money, and\nsince he was a generous man he did the right thing by the little girl:\nhe gave her some silver-backed brushes for her long hair, and a gold\nchain, and a reconstructed ruby for her finger. Gee, but it was good to\nbe alive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA year went by, a whole year, and he was not tired of her yet. He was\nnot a man who analysed his feelings, but this was so surprising that it\nforced itself upon his attention. There must be something very wonderful\nabout that girl. He couldn't help seeing that he was more wrapped up in\nher than ever, and sometimes the thought entered his mind that it might\nnot be a bad thing if he married her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen, one day the mate did not come in to dinner or to tea. Butler did\nnot bother himself about his absence at the first meal, but at the\nsecond he asked the Chinese cook:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where's the mate? He no come tea?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No wantchee,\" said the Chink.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He ain't sick?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No savvy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext day Bananas turned up again, but he was more sullen than ever, and\nafter dinner the captain asked the girl what was the matter with him.\nShe smiled and shrugged her pretty shoulders. She told the captain that\nBananas had taken a fancy to her and he was sore because she had told\nhim off. The captain was a good-humoured man and he was not of a jealous\nnature; it struck him as exceeding funny that Bananas should be in love.\nA man who had a squint like that had a precious poor chance. When tea\ncame round he chaffed him gaily. He pretended to speak in the air, so\nthat the mate should not be certain that he knew anything, but he dealt\nhim some pretty shrewd blows. The girl did not think him as funny as he\nthought himself, and afterwards she begged him to say nothing more. He\nwas surprised at her seriousness. She told him he did not know her\npeople. When their passion was aroused they were capable of anything.\nShe was a little frightened. This was so absurd to him that he laughed\nheartily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If he comes bothering round you, you just threaten to tell me. That'll\nfix him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Better fire him, I think.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not on your sweet life. I know a good sailor when I see one. But if he\ndon't leave you alone I'll give him the worst licking he's ever had.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPerhaps the girl had a wisdom unusual in her sex. She knew that it was\nuseless to argue with a man when his mind was made up, for it only\nincreased his stubbornness, and she held her peace. And now on the\nshabby schooner, threading her way across the silent sea, among those\nlovely islands, was enacted a dark, tense drama of which the fat little\ncaptain remained entirely ignorant. The girl's resistance fired Bananas\nso that he ceased to be a man, but was simply blind desire. He did not\nmake love to her gently or gaily, but with a black and savage ferocity.\nHer contempt now was changed to hatred and when he besought her she\nanswered him with bitter, angry taunts. But the struggle went on\nsilently, and when the captain asked her after a little while whether\nBananas was bothering her, she lied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut one night, when they were in Honolulu, he came on board only just in\ntime. They were sailing at dawn. Bananas had been ashore, drinking some\nnative spirit, and he was drunk. The captain, rowing up, heard sounds\nthat surprised him. He scrambled up the ladder. He saw Bananas, beside\nhimself, trying to wrench open the cabin door. He was shouting at the\ngirl. He swore he would kill her if she did not let him in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What in hell are you up to?\" cried Butler.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe mate let go the handle, gave the captain a look of savage hate, and\nwithout a word turned away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Stop here. What are you doing with that door?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe mate still did not answer. He looked at him with sullen, bootless\nrage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll teach you not to pull any of your queer stuff with me, you dirty,\ncross-eyed nigger,\" said the captain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was a good foot shorter than the mate and no match for him, but he\nwas used to dealing with native crews, and he had his knuckle-duster\nhandy. Perhaps it was not an instrument that a gentleman would use, but\nthen Captain Butler was not a gentleman. Nor was he in the habit of\ndealing with gentlemen. Before Bananas knew what the captain was at, his\nright arm had shot out and his fist, with its ring of steel, caught him\nfair and square on the jaw. He fell like a bull under the pole-axe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That'll learn him,\" said the captain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBananas did not stir. The girl unlocked the cabin door and came out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is he dead?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He ain't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe called a couple of men and told them to carry the mate to his bunk.\nHe rubbed his hands with satisfaction and his round blue eyes gleamed\nbehind his spectacles. But the girl was strangely silent. She put her\narms round him as though to protect him from invisible harm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was two or three days before Bananas was on his feet again, and when\nhe came out of his cabin his face was torn and swollen. Through the\ndarkness of his skin you saw the livid bruise. Butler saw him slinking\nalong the deck and called him. The mate went to him without a word.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"See here, Bananas,\" he said to him, fixing his spectacles on his\nslippery nose, for it was very hot. \"I ain't going to fire you for this,\nbut you know now that when I hit, I hit hard. Don't forget it and don't\nlet me have any more funny business.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he held out his hand and gave the mate that good-humoured, flashing\nsmile of his which was his greatest charm. The mate took the\noutstretched hand and twitched his swollen lips into a devilish grin.\nThe incident in the captain's mind was so completely finished that when\nthe three of them sat at dinner he chaffed Bananas on his appearance. He\nwas eating with difficulty and, his swollen face still more distorted by\npain, he looked truly a repulsive object.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat evening, when he was sitting on the upper deck, smoking his pipe, a\nshiver passed through the captain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what I should be shiverin' for on a night like this,\" he\ngrumbled. \"Maybe I've gotten a dose of fever. I've been feelin' a bit\nqueer all day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen he went to bed he took some quinine, and next morning he felt\nbetter, but a little washed out, as though he were recovering from a\ndebauch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess my liver's out of order,\" he said, and he took a pill.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had not much appetite that day and towards evening he began to feel\nvery unwell. He tried the next remedy he knew, which was to drink two or\nthree hot whiskies, but that did not seem to help him much, and when in\nthe morning he surveyed himself in the glass he thought he was not\nlooking quite the thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If I ain't right by the time we get back to Honolulu I'll just give Dr.\nDenby a call. He'll sure fix me up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe could not eat. He felt a great lassitude in all his limbs. He slept\nsoundly enough, but he awoke with no sense of refreshment; on the\ncontrary he felt a peculiar exhaustion. And the energetic little man,\nwho could not bear the thought of lying in bed, had to make an effort to\nforce himself out of his bunk. After a few days he found it impossible\nto resist the languor that oppressed him, and he made up his mind not to\nget up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bananas can look after the ship,\" he said. \"He has before now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe laughed a little to himself as he thought how often he had lain\nspeechless in his bunk after a night with the boys. That was before he\nhad his girl. He smiled at her and pressed her hand. She was puzzled and\nanxious. He saw that she was concerned about him and tried to reassure\nher. He had never had a day's illness in his life and in a week at the\noutside he would be as right as rain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish you'd fired Bananas,\" she said. \"I've got a feeling that he's at\nthe bottom of this.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damned good thing I didn't, or there'd be no one to sail the ship. I\nknow a good sailor when I see one.\" His blue eyes, rather pale now, with\nthe whites all yellow, twinkled. \"You don't think he's trying to poison\nme, little girl?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe did not answer, but she had one or two talks with the Chinese cook,\nand she took great care with the captain's food. But he ate little\nenough now, and it was only with the greatest difficulty that she\npersuaded him to drink a cup of soup two or three times a day. It was\nclear that he was very ill, he was losing weight quickly, and his chubby\nface was pale and drawn. He suffered no pain, but merely grew every day\nweaker and more languid. He was wasting away. The round trip on this\noccasion lasted about four weeks and by the time they came to Honolulu\nthe captain was a little anxious about himself. He had not been out of\nhis bed for more than a fortnight and really he felt too weak to get up\nand go to the doctor. He sent a message asking him to come on board. The\ndoctor examined him, but could find nothing to account for his\ncondition. His temperature was normal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"See here, Captain,\" he said, \"I'll be perfectly frank with you. I don't\nknow what's the matter with you, and just seeing you like this don't\ngive me a chance. You come into the hospital so that we can keep you\nunder observation. There's nothing organically wrong with you, I know\nthat, and my impression is that a few weeks in hospital ought to put you\nto rights.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I ain't going to leave my ship.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nChinese owners were queer customers, he said; if he left his ship\nbecause he was sick, his owner might fire him, and he couldn't afford to\nlose his job. So long as he stayed where he was his contract safeguarded\nhim, and he had a first-rate mate. Besides, he couldn't leave his girl.\nNo man could want a better nurse; if anyone could pull him through she\nwould. Every man had to die once and he only wished to be left in peace.\nHe would not listen to the doctor's expostulations, and finally the\ndoctor gave in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll write you a prescription,\" he said doubtfully, \"and see if it does\nyou any good. You'd better stay in bed for a while.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There ain't much fear of my getting up, doc,\" answered the captain. \"I\nfeel as weak as a cat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he believed in the doctor's prescription as little as did the doctor\nhimself, and when he was alone amused himself by lighting his cigar with\nit. He had to get amusement out of something, for his cigar tasted like\nnothing on earth, and he smoked only to persuade himself that he was not\ntoo ill to. That evening a couple of friends of his, masters of tramp\nsteamers, hearing he was sick came to see him. They discussed his case\nover a bottle of whisky and a box of Philippine cigars. One of them\nremembered how a mate of his had been taken queer just like that and not\na doctor in the United States had been able to cure him. He had seen in\nthe paper an advertisement of a patent medicine, and thought there'd be\nno harm in trying it. That man was as strong as ever he'd been in his\nlife after two bottles. But his illness had given Captain Butler a\nlucidity which was new and strange, and while they talked he seemed to\nread their minds. They thought he was dying. And when they left him he\nwas afraid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe girl saw his weakness. This was her opportunity. She had been urging\nhim to let a native doctor see him, and he had stoutly refused; but now\nshe entreated him. He listened with harassed eyes. He wavered. It was\nvery funny that the American doctor could not tell what was the matter\nwith him. But he did not want her to think that he was scared. If he let\na damned nigger come along and look at him, it was to comfort <i>her</i>. He\ntold her to do what she liked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe native doctor came the next night. The captain was lying alone, half\nawake, and the cabin was dimly lit by an oil lamp. The door was softly\nopened and the girl came in on tip-toe. She held the door open and\nsomeone slipped in silently behind her. The captain smiled at this\nmystery, but he was so weak now, the smile was no more than a glimmer in\nhis eyes. The doctor was a little, old man, very thin and very wrinkled,\nwith a completely bald head, and the face of a monkey. He was bowed and\ngnarled like an old tree. He looked hardly human, but his eyes were very\nbright, and in the half darkness they seemed to glow with a reddish\nlight. He was dressed filthily in a pair of ragged dungarees, and the\nupper part of his body was naked. He sat down on his haunches and for\nten minutes looked at the captain. Then he felt the palms of his hands\nand the soles of his feet. The girl watched him with frightened eyes. No\nword was spoken. Then he asked for something that the captain had worn.\nThe girl gave him the old felt hat which the captain used constantly and\ntaking it he sat down again on the floor, clasping it firmly with both\nhands; and rocking backwards and forwards slowly he muttered some\ngibberish in a very low tone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last he gave a little sigh and dropped the hat. He took an old pipe\nout of his trouser pocket and lit it. The girl went over to him and sat\nby his side. He whispered something to her, and she started violently.\nFor a few minutes they talked in hurried undertones, and then they stood\nup. She gave him money and opened the door for him. He slid out as\nsilently as he had come in. Then she went over to the captain and leaned\nover him so that she could speak into his ear.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's an enemy praying you to death.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't talk fool stuff, girlie,\" he said impatiently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's truth. It's God's truth. That's why the American doctor couldn't\ndo anything. Our people can do that. I've seen it done. I thought you\nwere safe because you were a white man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't an enemy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bananas.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's he want to pray me to death for?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You ought to have fired him before he had a chance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess if I ain't got nothing more the matter with me than Bananas'\nhoodoo I shall be sitting up and taking nourishment in a very few days.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was silent for a while and she looked at him intently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you know you're dying?\" she said to him at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat was what the two skippers had thought, but they hadn't said it. A\nshiver passed across the captain's wan face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The doctor says there ain't nothing really the matter with me. I've\nonly to lie quiet for a bit and I shall be all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe put her lips to his ear as if she were afraid that the air itself\nmight hear.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're dying, dying, dying. You'll pass out with the old moon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's something to know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll pass out with the old moon unless Bananas dies before.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was not a timid man and he had recovered already from the shock her\nwords, and still more her vehement, silent manner, had given him. Once\nmore a smile flickered in his eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess I'll take my chance, girlie.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's twelve days before the new moon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was something in her tone that gave him an idea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"See here, my girl, this is all bunk. I don't believe a word of it. But\nI don't want you to try any of your monkey tricks with Bananas. He ain't\na beauty, but he's a first-rate mate.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe would have said a good deal more, but he was tired out. He suddenly\nfelt very weak and faint. It was always at that hour that he felt worse.\nHe closed his eyes. The girl watched him for a minute and then slipped\nout of the cabin. The moon, nearly full, made a silver pathway over the\ndark sea. It shone from an unclouded sky. She looked at it with terror,\nfor she knew that with its death the man she loved would die. His life\nwas in her hands. She could save him, she alone could save him, but the\nenemy was cunning, and she must be cunning too. She felt that someone\nwas looking at her, and without turning, by the sudden fear that seized\nher, knew that from the shadow the burning eyes of the mate were fixed\nupon her. She did not know what he could do; if he could read her\nthoughts she was defeated already, and with a desperate effort she\nemptied her mind of all content. His death alone could save her lover,\nand she could bring his death about. She knew that if he could be\nbrought to look into a calabash in which was water so that a reflection\nof him was made, and the reflection were broken by hurtling the water,\nhe would die as though he had been struck by lightning; for the\nreflection was his soul. But none knew better than he the danger, and he\ncould be made to look only by a guile which had lulled his least\nsuspicion. He must never think that he had an enemy who was on the watch\nto cause his destruction. She knew what she had to do. But the time was\nshort, the time was terribly short. Presently she realised that the mate\nhad gone. She breathed more freely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTwo days later they sailed, and there were ten now before the new moon.\nCaptain Butler was terrible to see. He was nothing but skin and bone,\nand he could not move without help. He could hardly speak. But she dared\ndo nothing yet. She knew that she must be patient. The mate was cunning,\ncunning. They went to one of the smaller islands of the group and\ndischarged cargo, and now there were only seven days more. The moment\nhad come to start. She brought some things out of the cabin she shared\nwith the captain and made them into a bundle. She put the bundle in the\ndeck cabin where she and Bananas ate their meals, and at dinner time,\nwhen she went in, he turned quickly and she saw that he had been looking\nat it. Neither of them spoke, but she knew what he suspected. She was\nmaking her preparations to leave the ship. He looked at her mockingly.\nGradually, as though to prevent the captain from knowing what she was\nabout, she brought everything she owned into the cabin, and some of the\ncaptain's clothes, and made them all into bundles. At last Bananas could\nkeep silence no longer. He pointed to a suit of ducks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do with that?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going back to my island.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave a laugh that distorted his grim face. The captain was dying and\nshe meant to get away with all she could lay hands on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What'll you do if I say you can't take those things? They're the\ncaptain's.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're no use to you,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a calabash hanging on the wall. It was the very calabash I had\nseen when I came into the cabin and which we had talked about. She took\nit down. It was all dusty, so she poured water into it from the\nwater-bottle, and rinsed it with her fingers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you doing with that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can sell it for fifty dollars,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you want to take it you'll have to pay me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What d'you want?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know what I want.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe allowed a fleeting smile to play on her lips. She flashed a quick\nlook at him and quickly turned away. He gave a gasp of desire. She\nraised her shoulders in a little shrug. With a savage bound he sprang\nupon her and seized her in his arms. Then she laughed. She put her arms,\nher soft, round arms, about his neck, and surrendered herself to him\nvoluptuously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen the morning came she roused him out of a deep sleep. The early rays\nof the sun slanted into the cabin. He pressed her to his heart. Then he\ntold her that the captain could not last more than a day or two, and the\nowner wouldn't so easily find another white man to command the ship. If\nBananas offered to take less money he would get the job and the girl\ncould stay with him. He looked at her with lovesick eyes. She nestled up\nagainst him. She kissed his lips, in the foreign way, in the way the\ncaptain had taught her to kiss. And she promised to stay. Bananas was\ndrunk with happiness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was now or never.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe got up and went to the table to arrange her hair. There was no\nmirror and she looked into the calabash, seeking for her reflection. She\ntidied her beautiful hair. Then she beckoned to Bananas to come to her.\nShe pointed to the calabash.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's something in the bottom of it,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nInstinctively, without suspecting anything, Bananas looked full into the\nwater. His face was reflected in it. In a flash she beat upon it\nviolently, with both her hands, so that they pounded on the bottom and\nthe water splashed up. The reflection was broken in pieces. Bananas\nstarted back with a sudden hoarse cry and he looked at the girl. She was\nstanding there with a look of triumphant hatred on her face. A horror\ncame into his eyes. His heavy features were twisted in agony, and with a\nthud, as though he had taken a violent poison, he crumpled up on the\nground. A great shudder passed through his body and he was still. She\nleaned over him callously. She put her hand on his heart and then she\npulled down his lower eye-lid. He was quite dead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe went into the cabin in which lay Captain Butler. There was a faint\ncolour in his cheeks and he looked at her in a startled way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's happened?\" he whispered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were the first words he had spoken for forty-eight hours.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing's happened,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I feel all funny.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen his eyes closed and he fell asleep. He slept for a day and a night,\nand when he awoke he asked for food. In a fortnight he was well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was past midnight when Winter and I rowed back to shore and we had\ndrunk innumerable whiskies and sodas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you think of it all?\" asked Winter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a question! If you mean, have I any explanation to suggest, I\nhaven't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The captain believes every word of it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's obvious; but, you know, that's not the part that interests me\nmost: whether it's true or not, and what it all means; the part that\ninterests me is that such things should happen to such people. I wonder\nwhat there is in that common-place little man to arouse such a passion\nin that lovely creature. As I watched her, asleep there, while he was\ntelling the story I had some fantastic idea about the power of love\nbeing able to work miracles.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But that's not the girl,\" said Winter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What on earth do you mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Didn't you notice the cook?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I did. He's the ugliest man I ever saw.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's why Butler took him. The girl ran away with the Chinese cook\nlast year. This is a new one. He's only had her there about two months.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'm hanged.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He thinks this cook is safe. But I wouldn't be too sure in his place.\nThere's something about a Chink, when he lays himself out to please a\nwoman she can't resist him.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI caught sight of her at the play and in answer to her beckoning I went\nover during the interval and sat down beside her. It was long since I\nhad last seen her and if someone had not mentioned her name I hardly\nthink I would have recognised her. She addressed me brightly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it's many years since we first met. How time does fly! We're none\nof us getting any younger. Do you remember the first time I saw you? You\nasked me to luncheon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDid I remember?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was twenty years ago and I was living in Paris. I had a tiny\napartment in the Latin Quarter overlooking a cemetery and I was earning\nbarely enough money to keep body and soul together. She had read a book\nof mine and had written to me about it. I answered, thanking her, and\npresently I received from her another letter saying that she was passing\nthrough Paris and would like to have a chat with me; but her time was\nlimited and the only free moment she had was on the following Thursday;\nshe was spending the morning at the Luxembourg and would I give her a\nlittle luncheon at Foyot's afterwards? Foyot's is a restaurant at which\nthe French senators eat and it was so far beyond my means that I had\nnever even thought of going there. But I was flattered and I was too\nyoung to have learned to say no to a woman. (Few men, I may add, learn\nthis until they are too old to make it of any consequence to a woman\nwhat they say.) I had eighty francs (gold francs) to last me the rest of\nthe month and a modest luncheon should not cost more than fifteen. If I\ncut out coffee for the next two weeks I could manage well enough.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI answered that I would meet my friend--by correspondence--at Foyot's on\nThursday at half-past twelve. She was not so young as I expected and in\nappearance imposing rather than attractive. She was in fact a woman of\nforty (a charming age, but not one that excites a sudden and devastating\npassion at first sight), and she gave me the impression of having more\nteeth, white and large and even, than were necessary for any practical\npurpose. She was talkative, but since she seemed inclined to talk about\nme I was prepared to be an attentive listener.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was startled when the bill of fare was brought, for the prices were a\ngreat deal higher than I had anticipated. But she reassured me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never eat anything for luncheon,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, don't say that!\" I answered generously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never eat more than one thing. I think people eat far too much\nnowadays. A little fish, perhaps. I wonder if they have any salmon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWell, it was early in the year for salmon and it was not on the bill of\nfare, but I asked the waiter if there was any. Yes, a beautiful salmon\nhad just come in, it was the first they had had. I ordered it for my\nguest. The waiter asked her if she would have something while it was\nbeing cooked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No,\" she answered, \"I never eat more than one thing. Unless you had a\nlittle caviare. I never mind caviare.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy heart sank a little. I knew I could not afford caviare, but I could\nnot very well tell her that. I told the waiter by all means to bring\ncaviare. For myself I chose the cheapest dish on the menu and that was a\nmutton chop.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think you're unwise to eat meat,\" she said. \"I don't know how you can\nexpect to work after eating heavy things like chops. I don't believe in\noverloading my stomach.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen came the question of drink.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never drink anything for luncheon,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Neither do I,\" I answered promptly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Except white wine,\" she proceeded as though I had not spoken. \"These\nFrench white wines are so light. They're wonderful for the digestion.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What would you like?\" I asked, hospitable still, but not exactly\neffusive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave me a bright and amicable flash of her white teeth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My doctor won't let me drink anything but champagne.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI fancy I turned a trifle pale. I ordered half a bottle. I mentioned\ncasually that my doctor had absolutely forbidden me to drink champagne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to drink, then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Water.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe ate the caviare and she ate the salmon. She talked gaily of art and\nliterature and music. But I wondered what the bill would come to. When\nmy mutton chop arrived she took me quite seriously to task.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see that you're in the habit of eating a heavy luncheon. I'm sure\nit's a mistake. Why don't you follow my example and just eat one thing?\nI'm sure you'd feel ever so much better for it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I <i>am</i> only going to eat one thing,\" I said, as the waiter came again\nwith the bill of fare.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe waved him aside with an airy gesture.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, no, I never eat anything for luncheon. Just a bite, I never want\nmore than that, and I eat that more as an excuse for conversation than\nanything else. I couldn't possibly eat anything more--unless they had\nsome of those giant asparagus. I should be sorry to leave Paris without\nhaving some of them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy heart sank. I had seen them in the shops and I knew that they were\nhorribly expensive. My mouth had often watered at the sight of them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Madame wants to know if you have any of those giant asparagus,\" I asked\nthe waiter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI tried with all my might to will him to say no. A happy smile spread\nover his broad, priest-like face, and he assured me that they had some\nso large, so splendid, so tender, that it was a marvel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not in the least hungry,\" my guest sighed, \"but if you insist I\ndon't mind having some asparagus.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI ordered them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Aren't you going to have any?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I never eat asparagus.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know there are people who don't like them. The fact is, you ruin your\npalate by all the meat you eat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe waited for the asparagus to be cooked. Panic seized me. It was not a\nquestion now how much money I should have left over for the rest of the\nmonth, but whether I had enough to pay the bill. It would be mortifying\nto find myself ten francs short and be obliged to borrow from my guest.\nI could not bring myself to do that. I knew exactly how much I had and\nif the bill came to more I made up my mind that I would put my hand in\nmy pocket and with a dramatic cry start up and say it had been picked.\nOf course it would be awkward if she had not money enough either to pay\nthe bill. Then the only thing would be to leave my watch and say I would\ncome back and pay later.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe asparagus appeared. They were enormous, succulent and appetising.\nThe smell of the melted butter tickled my nostrils as the nostrils of\nJehovah were tickled by the burned offerings of the virtuous Semites. I\nwatched the abandoned woman thrust them down her throat in large\nvoluptuous mouthfuls and in my polite way I discoursed on the condition\nof the drama in the Balkans. At last she finished.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Coffee?\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, just an ice-cream and coffee,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was past caring now, so I ordered coffee for myself and an ice-cream\nand coffee for her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, there's one thing I thoroughly believe in,\" she said, as she\nate the ice-cream. \"One should always get up from a meal feeling one\ncould eat a little more.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you still hungry?\" I asked faintly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, no, I'm not hungry; you see, I don't eat luncheon. I have a cup of\ncoffee in the morning and then dinner, but I never eat more than one\nthing for luncheon. I was speaking for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I see!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen a terrible thing happened. While we were waiting for the coffee,\nthe head waiter, with an ingratiating smile on his false face, came up\nto us bearing a large basket full of huge peaches. They had the blush of\nan innocent girl; they had the rich tone of an Italian landscape. But\nsurely peaches were not in season then? Lord knew what they cost. I knew\ntoo--a little later, for my guest, going on with her conversation,\nabsentmindedly took one.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see, you've filled your stomach with a lot of meat\"--my one\nmiserable little chop--\"and you can't eat any more. But I've just had a\nsnack and I shall enjoy a peach.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe bill came and when I paid it I found that I had only enough for a\nquite inadequate tip. Her eyes rested for an instant on the three francs\nI left for the waiter and I knew that she thought me mean. But when I\nwalked out of the restaurant I had the whole month before me and not a\npenny in my pocket.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Follow my example,\" she said as we shook hands, \"and never eat more\nthan one thing for luncheon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll do better than that,\" I retorted. \"I'll eat nothing for dinner\nto-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Humorist!\" she cried gaily, jumping into a cab, \"You're quite a\nhumorist!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut I have had my revenge at last. I do not believe that I am a\nvindictive man, but when the immortal gods take a hand in the matter it\nis pardonable to observe the result with complacency. To-day she weighs\ntwenty-one stone.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nWhen I was a very small boy I was made to learn by heart certain of the\nfables of La Fontaine, and the moral of each was carefully explained to\nme. Among those I learnt was <i>The Ant and The Grasshopper</i>, which is\ndevised to bring home to the young the useful lesson that in an\nimperfect world industry is rewarded and giddiness punished. In this\nadmirable fable (I apologise for telling something which everyone is\npolitely, but inexactly, supposed to know) the ant spends a laborious\nsummer gathering its winter store, while the grasshopper sits on a blade\nof grass singing to the sun. Winter comes and the ant is comfortably\nprovided for, but the grasshopper has an empty larder: he goes to the\nant and begs for a little food. Then the ant gives him her classic\nanswer:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What were you doing in the summer time?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Saving your presence, I sang, I sang all day, all night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You sang. Why, then go and dance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI do not ascribe it to perversity on my part, but rather to the\ninconsequence of childhood, which is deficient in moral sense, that I\ncould never quite reconcile myself to the lesson. My sympathies were\nwith the grasshopper and for some time I never saw an ant without\nputting my foot on it. In this summary (and as I have discovered since,\nentirely human) fashion I sought to express my disapproval of prudence\nand commonsense.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI could not help thinking of this fable when the other day I saw George\nRamsay lunching by himself in a restaurant. I never saw anyone wear an\nexpression of such deep gloom. He was staring into space. He looked as\nthough the burden of the whole world sat on his shoulders. I was sorry\nfor him: I suspected at once that his unfortunate brother had been\ncausing trouble again. I went up to him and held out my hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How are you?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not in hilarious spirits,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it Tom again?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, it's Tom again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why don't you chuck him? You've done everything in the world for him.\nYou must know by now that he's quite hopeless.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI suppose every family has a black sheep. Tom had been a sore trial to\nhis for twenty years. He had begun life decently enough: he went into\nbusiness, married and had two children. The Ramsays were perfectly\nrespectable people and there was every reason to suppose that Tom Ramsay\nwould have a useful and honourable career. But one day, without warning,\nhe announced that he didn't like work and that he wasn't suited for\nmarriage. He wanted to enjoy himself. He would listen to no\nexpostulations. He left his wife and his office. He had a little money\nand he spent two happy years in the various capitals of Europe. Rumours\nof his doings reached his relations from time to time and they were\nprofoundly shocked. He certainly had a very good time. They shook their\nheads and asked what would happen when his money was spent. They soon\nfound out: he borrowed. He was charming and unscrupulous. I have never\nmet anyone to whom it was more difficult to refuse a loan. He made a\nsteady income from his friends and he made friends easily. But he always\nsaid that the money you spent on necessities was boring; the money that\nwas amusing to spend was the money you spent on luxuries. For this he\ndepended on his brother George. He did not waste his charm on him.\nGeorge was a serious man and insensible to such enticements. George was\nrespectable. Once or twice he fell to Tom's promises of amendment and\ngave him considerable sums in order that he might make a fresh start. On\nthese Tom bought a motor-car and some very nice jewellery. But when\ncircumstances forced George to realise that his brother would never\nsettle down and he washed his hands of him, Tom, without a qualm, began\nto blackmail him. It was not very nice for a respectable lawyer to find\nhis brother shaking cocktails behind the bar of his favourite restaurant\nor to see him waiting on the box-seat of a taxi outside his club. Tom\nsaid that to serve in a bar or to drive a taxi was a perfectly decent\noccupation, but if George could oblige him with a couple of hundred\npounds he didn't mind for the honour of the family giving it up. George\npaid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOnce Tom nearly went to prison. George was terribly upset. He went into\nthe whole discreditable affair. Really Tom had gone too far. He had been\nwild, thoughtless and selfish, but he had never before done anything\ndishonest, by which George meant illegal; and if he were prosecuted he\nwould assuredly be convicted. But you cannot allow your only brother to\ngo to gaol. The man Tom had cheated, a man called Cronshaw, was\nvindictive. He was determined to take the matter into court; he said Tom\nwas a scoundrel and should be punished. It cost George an infinite deal\nof trouble and five hundred pounds to settle the affair. I have never\nseen him in such a rage as when he heard that Tom and Cronshaw had gone\noff together to Monte Carlo the moment they cashed the cheque. They\nspent a happy month there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor twenty years Tom raced and gambled, philandered with the prettiest\ngirls, danced, ate in the most expensive restaurants, and dressed\nbeautifully. He always looked as if he had just stepped out of a\nbandbox. Though he was forty-six you would never have taken him for more\nthan thirty-five. He was a most amusing companion and though you knew he\nwas perfectly worthless you could not but enjoy his society. He had high\nspirits, an unfailing gaiety and incredible charm. I never grudged the\ncontributions he regularly levied on me for the necessities of his\nexistence. I never lent him fifty pounds without feeling that I was in\nhis debt. Tom Ramsay knew everyone and everyone knew Tom Ramsay. You\ncould not approve of him, but you could not help liking him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPoor George, only a year older than his scapegrace brother, looked\nsixty. He had never taken more than a fortnight's holiday in the year\nfor a quarter of a century. He was in his office every morning at\nnine-thirty and never left it till six. He was honest, industrious and\nworthy. He had a good wife, to whom he had never been unfaithful even in\nthought, and four daughters to whom he was the best of fathers. He made\na point of saving a third of his income and his plan was to retire at\nfifty-five to a little house in the country where he proposed to\ncultivate his garden and play golf. His life was blameless. He was glad\nthat he was growing old because Tom was growing old too. He rubbed his\nhands and said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was all very well when Tom was young and good-looking, but he's only\na year younger than I am. In four years he'll be fifty. He won't find\nlife so easy then. I shall have thirty thousand pounds by the time I'm\nfifty. For twenty-five years I've said that Tom would end in the gutter.\nAnd we shall see how he likes that. We shall see if it really pays best\nto work or be idle.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPoor George! I sympathised with him. I wondered now as I sat down beside\nhim what infamous thing Tom had done. George was evidently very much\nupset.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you know what's happened now?\" he asked me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was prepared for the worst. I wondered if Tom had got into the hands\nof the police at last. George could hardly bring himself to speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not going to deny that all my life I've been hard-working,\ndecent, respectable and straightforward. After a life of industry and\nthrift I can look forward to retiring on a small income in gilt-edged\nsecurities. I've always done my duty in that state of life in which it\nhas pleased Providence to place me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"True.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And you can't deny that Tom has been an idle, worthless, dissolute and\ndishonourable rogue. If there were any justice he'd be in the\nworkhouse.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"True.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge grew red in the face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A few weeks ago he became engaged to a woman old enough to be his\nmother. And now she's died and left him everything she had. Half a\nmillion pounds, a yacht, a house in London and a house in the country.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Ramsay beat his clenched fist on the table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not fair, I tell you, it's not fair. Damn it, it's not fair.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI could not help it. I burst into a shout of laughter as I looked at\nGeorge's wrathful face, I rolled in my chair, I very nearly fell on the\nfloor. George never forgave me. But Tom often asks me to excellent\ndinners in his charming house in Mayfair, and if he occasionally borrows\na trifle from me, that is merely from force of habit. It is never more\nthan a sovereign.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThe farm lay in a hollow among the Somersetshire hills, an old-fashioned\nstone house surrounded by barns and pens and out-houses. Over the\ndoorway the date when it was built had been carved in the elegant\nfigures of the period, 1673, and the house, grey and weather-beaten,\nlooked as much a part of the landscape as the trees that sheltered it.\nAn avenue of splendid elms that would have been the pride of many a\nsquire's mansion led from the road to the trim garden. The people who\nlived here were as stolid, sturdy and unpretentious as the house; their\nonly boast was that ever since it was built from father to son in one\nunbroken line they had been born and died in it. For three hundred years\nthey had farmed the surrounding land. George Meadows was now a man of\nfifty, and his wife was a year or two younger. They were both fine,\nupstanding people in the prime of life; and their children, two sons and\nthree girls, were handsome and strong. They had no newfangled notions\nabout being gentlemen and ladies; they knew their place and were proud\nof it. I have never seen a more united household. They were merry,\nindustrious and kindly. Their life was patriarchal. It had a\ncompleteness that gave it a beauty as definite as that of a symphony by\nBeethoven or a picture by Titian. They were happy and they deserved\ntheir happiness. But the master of the house was not George Meadows (not\nby a long chalk, they said in the village); it was his mother. She was\ntwice the man her son was, they said. She was a woman of seventy, tall,\nupright and dignified, with grey hair, and though her face was much\nwrinkled, her eyes were bright and shrewd. Her word was law in the house\nand on the farm; but she had humour, and if her rule was despotic it was\nalso kindly. People laughed at her jokes and repeated them. She was a\ngood business woman and you had to get up very early in the morning to\nbest her in a bargain. She was a character. She combined in a rare\ndegree good will with an alert sense of the ridiculous.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne day Mrs. George stopped me on my way home. She was all in a flutter.\n(Her mother-in-law was the only Mrs. Meadows we knew; George's wife was\nonly known as Mrs. George.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Whoever do you think is coming here to-day?\" she asked me. \"Uncle\nGeorge Meadows. You know, him as was in China.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, I thought he was dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We all thought he was dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had heard the story of Uncle George Meadows a dozen times, and it had\namused me because it had the savour of an old ballad: it was oddly\ntouching to come across it in real life. For Uncle George Meadows and\nTom, his younger brother, had both courted Mrs. Meadows when she was\nEmily Green, fifty years and more ago, and when she married Tom, George\nhad gone away to sea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey heard of him on the China coast. For twenty years now and then he\nsent them presents; then there was no more news of him; when Tom Meadows\ndied his widow wrote and told him, but received no answer; and at last\nthey came to the conclusion that he must be dead. But two or three days\nago to their astonishment they had received a letter from the matron of\nthe sailors' home at Portsmouth. It appeared that for the last ten years\nGeorge Meadows, crippled with rheumatism, had been an inmate and now,\nfeeling that he had not much longer to live, wanted to see once more the\nhouse in which he was born. Albert Meadows, his great-nephew, had gone\nover to Portsmouth in the Ford to fetch him and he was to arrive that\nafternoon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Just fancy,\" said Mrs. George, \"he's not been here for more than fifty\nyears. He's never even seen my George, who's fifty-one next birthday.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what does Mrs. Meadows think of it?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you know what she is. She sits there and smiles to herself. All\nshe says is, 'He was a good-looking young fellow when he left, but not\nso steady as his brother.' That's why she chose my George's father. 'But\nhe's probably quietened down by now,' she says.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. George asked me to look in and see him. With the simplicity of a\ncountry woman who had never been further from her home than London, she\nthought that because we had both been in China we must have something in\ncommon. Of course I accepted. I found the whole family assembled when I\narrived; they were sitting in the great old kitchen, with its stone\nfloor, Mrs. Meadows in her usual chair by the fire, very upright, and I\nwas amused to see that she had put on her best silk dress, while her son\nand his wife sat at the table with their children. On the other side of\nthe fireplace sat an old man, bunched up in a chair. He was very thin\nand his skin hung on his bones like an old suit much too large for him;\nhis face was wrinkled and yellow and he had lost nearly all his teeth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI shook hands with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'm glad to see you've got here safely, Mr. Meadows,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Captain,\" he corrected.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He walked here,\" Albert, his great-nephew, told me. \"When he got to the\ngate he made me stop the car and said he wanted to walk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And mind you, I've not been out of my bed for two years. They carried\nme down and put me in the car. I thought I'd never walk again, but when\nI see them elm trees, I remember my father set a lot of store by them\nelm trees, I felt I could walk. I walked down that drive fifty-two years\nago when I went away and now I've walked back again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Silly, I call it,\" said Mrs. Meadows.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's done me good. I feel better and stronger than I have for ten\nyears. I'll see you out yet, Emily.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you be too sure,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI suppose no one had called Mrs. Meadows by her first name for a\ngeneration. It gave me a little shock, as though the old man were taking\na liberty with her. She looked at him with a shrewd smile in her eyes\nand he, talking to her, grinned with his toothless gums. It was strange\nto look at them, these two old people who had not seen one another for\nhalf a century, and to think that all that long time ago he had loved\nher and she had loved another. I wondered if they remembered what they\nhad felt then and what they had said to one another. I wondered if it\nseemed to him strange now that for that old woman he had left the home\nof his fathers, his lawful inheritance, and lived an exile's life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you ever been married, Captain Meadows?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not me,\" he said, in his quavering voice, with a grin. \"I know too much\nabout women for that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's what you say,\" retorted Mrs. Meadows. \"If the truth was known I\nshouldn't be surprised to hear as how you'd had half a dozen black wives\nin your day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're not black in China, Emily, you ought to know better than that,\nthey're yellow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps that's why you've got so yellow yourself. When I saw you, I\nsaid to myself, why, he's got jaundice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I said I'd never marry anyone but you, Emily, and I never have.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe said this not with pathos or resentment, but as a mere statement of\nfact, as a man might say, \"I said I'd walk twenty miles and I've done\nit.\" There was a trace of satisfaction in the speech.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you might have regretted it if you had,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI talked a little with the old man about China.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's not a port in China that I don't know better than you know your\ncoat pocket. Where a ship can go I've been. I could keep you sitting\nhere all day long for six months and not tell you half the things I've\nseen in my day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, one thing you've not done, George, as far as I can see,\" said\nMrs. Meadows, the mocking but not unkindly smile still in her eyes, \"and\nthat's to make a fortune.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not one to save money. Make it and spend it; that's my motto. But\none thing I can say for myself: if I had the chance of going through my\nlife again I'd take it. And there's not many as'll say that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, indeed,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI looked at him with admiration and respect. He was a toothless,\ncrippled, penniless old man, but he had made a success of life, for he\nhad enjoyed it. When I left him he asked me to come and see him again\nnext day. If I was interested in China he would tell me all the stories\nI wanted to hear.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext morning I thought I would go and ask if the old man would like to\nsee me. I strolled down the magnificent avenue of elm trees and when I\ncame to the garden saw Mrs. Meadows picking flowers. I bade her\ngood-morning and she raised herself. She had a huge armful of white\nflowers. I glanced at the house and I saw that the blinds were drawn: I\nwas surprised, for Mrs. Meadows liked the sunshine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Time enough to live in the dark when you're buried,\" she always said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How's Captain Meadows?\" I asked her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He always was a harum-scarum fellow,\" she answered. \"When Lizzie took\nhim a cup of tea this morning she found he was dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dead?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. Died in his sleep. I was just picking these flowers to put in the\nroom. Well, I'm glad he died in that old house. It always means a lot to\nthem Meadows to do that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey had had a good deal of difficulty in persuading him to go to bed.\nHe had talked to them of all the things that had happened to him in his\nlong life. He was happy to be back in his old home. He was proud that he\nhad walked up the drive without assistance, and he boasted that he would\nlive for another twenty years. But fate had been kind: death had written\nthe full-stop in the right place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Meadows smelt the white flowers that she held in her arms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'm glad he came back,\" she said. \"After I married Tom Meadows\nand George went away, the fact is I was never quite sure that I'd\nmarried the right one.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nWhen I was introduced to Lawson by Chaplin, the owner of the Hotel\nMetropole at Apia, I paid no particular attention to him. We were\nsitting in the lounge over an early cocktail and I was listening with\namusement to the gossip of the island.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nChaplin entertained me. He was by profession a mining engineer and\nperhaps it was characteristic of him that he had settled in a place\nwhere his professional attainments were of no possible value. It was,\nhowever, generally reported that he was an extremely clever mining\nengineer. He was a small man, neither fat nor thin, with black hair,\nscanty on the crown, turning grey, and a small, untidy moustache; his\nface, partly from the sun and partly from liquor, was very red. He was\nbut a figurehead, for the hotel, though so grandly named but a frame\nbuilding of two storeys, was managed by his wife, a tall, gaunt\nAustralian of five and forty, with an imposing presence and a determined\nair. The little man, excitable and often tipsy, was terrified of her,\nand the stranger soon heard of domestic quarrels in which she used her\nfist and her foot in order to keep him in subjection. She had been known\nafter a night of drunkenness to confine him for twenty-four hours to his\nown room, and then he could be seen, afraid to leave his prison, talking\nsomewhat pathetically from his verandah to people in the street below.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was a character, and his reminiscences of a varied life, whether true\nor not, made him worth listening to, so that when Lawson strolled in I\nwas inclined to resent the interruption. Although not mid-day, it was\nclear that he had had enough to drink, and it was without enthusiasm\nthat I yielded to his persistence and accepted his offer of another\ncocktail. I knew already that Chaplin's head was weak. The next round\nwhich in common politeness I should be forced to order would be enough\nto make him lively, and then Mrs. Chaplin would give me black looks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNor was there anything attractive in Lawson's appearance. He was a\nlittle thin man, with a long, sallow face and a narrow, weak chin, a\nprominent nose, large and bony, and great shaggy black eyebrows. They\ngave him a peculiar look. His eyes, very large and very dark, were\nmagnificent. He was jolly, but his jollity did not seem to me sincere;\nit was on the surface, a mask which he wore to deceive the world, and I\nsuspected that it concealed a mean nature. He was plainly anxious to be\nthought a \"good sport\" and he was hail-fellow-well-met; but, I do not\nknow why, I felt that he was cunning and shifty. He talked a great deal\nin a raucous voice, and he and Chaplin capped one another's stories of\nbeanos which had become legendary, stories of \"wet\" nights at the\nEnglish Club, of shooting expeditions where an incredible amount of\nwhisky had been consumed, and of jaunts to Sydney of which their pride\nwas that they could remember nothing from the time they landed till the\ntime they sailed. A pair of drunken swine. But even in their\nintoxication, for by now, after four cocktails each, neither was sober,\nthere was a great difference between Chaplin, rough and vulgar, and\nLawson: Lawson might be drunk, but he was certainly a gentleman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last he got out of his chair, a little unsteadily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'll be getting along home,\" he said. \"See you before dinner.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Missus all right?\" said Chaplin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went out. There was a peculiar note in the monosyllable of his answer\nwhich made me look up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good chap,\" said Chaplin flatly, as Lawson went out of the door into\nthe sunshine. \"One of the best. Pity he drinks.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis from Chaplin was an observation not without humour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And when he's drunk he wants to fight people.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is he often drunk?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dead drunk, three or four days a week. It's the island done it, and\nEthel.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who's Ethel?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ethel's his wife. Married a half-caste. Old Brevald's daughter. Took\nher away from here. Only thing to do. But she couldn't stand it, and now\nthey're back again. He'll hang himself one of these days, if he don't\ndrink himself to death before. Good chap. Nasty when he's drunk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nChaplin belched loudly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll go and put my head under the shower. I oughtn't to have had that\nlast cocktail. It's always the last one that does you in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked uncertainly at the staircase as he made up his mind to go to\nthe cubby hole in which was the shower, and then with unnatural\nseriousness got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pay you to cultivate Lawson,\" he said. \"A well-read chap. You'd be\nsurprised when he's sober. Clever too. Worth talking to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nChaplin had told me the whole story in these few speeches.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen I came in towards evening from a ride along the sea-shore Lawson\nwas again in the hotel. He was heavily sunk in one of the cane chairs in\nthe lounge and he looked at me with glassy eyes. It was plain that he\nhad been drinking all the afternoon. He was torpid, and the look on his\nface was sullen and vindictive. His glance rested on me for a moment,\nbut I could see that he did not recognise me. Two or three other men\nwere sitting there, shaking dice, and they took no notice of him. His\ncondition was evidently too usual to attract attention. I sat down and\nbegan to play.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're a damned sociable lot,\" said Lawson suddenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got out of his chair and waddled with bent knees towards the door. I\ndo not know whether the spectacle was more ridiculous than revolting.\nWhen he had gone one of the men sniggered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Lawson's fairly soused to-day,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If I couldn't carry my liquor better than that,\" said another, \"I'd\nclimb on the waggon and stay there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWho would have thought that this wretched object was in his way a\nromantic figure or that his life had in it those elements of pity and\nterror which the theorist tells us are necessary to achieve the effect\nof tragedy?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not see him again for two or three days.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was sitting one evening on the first floor of the hotel on a verandah\nthat overlooked the street when Lawson came up and sank into a chair\nbeside me. He was quite sober. He made a casual remark and then, when I\nhad replied somewhat indifferently, added with a laugh which had in it\nan apologetic tone:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was devilish soused the other day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not answer. There was really nothing to say. I pulled away at my\npipe in the vain hope of keeping the mosquitoes away, and looked at the\nnatives going home from their work. They walked with long steps, slowly,\nwith care and dignity, and the soft patter of their naked feet was\nstrange to hear. Their dark hair, curling or straight, was often white\nwith lime, and then they had a look of extraordinary distinction. They\nwere tall and finely built. Then a gang of Solomon Islanders, indentured\nlabourers, passed by, singing; they were shorter and slighter than the\nSamoans, coal-black, with great heads of fuzzy hair dyed red. Now and\nthen a white man drove past in his buggy or rode into the hotel yard. In\nthe lagoon two or three schooners reflected their grace in the tranquil\nwater.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what there is to do in a place like this except to get\nsoused,\" said Lawson at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you like Samoa?\" I asked casually, for something to say.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's pretty, isn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe word he chose seemed so inadequate to describe the unimaginable\nbeauty of the island that I smiled, and smiling I turned to look at him.\nI was startled by the expression in those fine sombre eyes of his, an\nexpression of intolerable anguish; they betrayed a tragic depth of\nemotion of which I should never have thought him capable. But the\nexpression passed away and he smiled. His smile was simple and a little\nnaïve. It changed his face so that I wavered in my first feeling of\naversion from him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was all over the place when I first came out,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was silent for a moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I went away for good about three years ago, but I came back.\" He\nhesitated. \"My wife wanted to come back. She was born here, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was silent again, and then hazarded a remark about Robert Louis\nStevenson. He asked me if I had been up to Vailima. For some reason he\nwas making an effort to be agreeable to me. He began to talk of\nStevenson's books, and presently the conversation drifted to London.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose Covent Garden's still going strong,\" he said. \"I think I miss\nthe opera as much as anything here. Have you seen <i>Tristan and Isolde</i>?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe asked me the question as though the answer were really important to\nhim, and when I said, a little casually I daresay, that I had, he seemed\npleased. He began to speak of Wagner, not as a musician, but as the\nplain man who received from him an emotional satisfaction that he could\nnot analyse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose Bayreuth was the place to go really,\" he said. \"I never had\nthe money, worse luck. But of course one might do worse than Covent\nGarden, all the lights and the women dressed up to the nines, and the\nmusic. The first act of the <i>Walküre's</i> all right, isn't it? And the end\nof <i>Tristan</i>. Golly!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis eyes were flashing now and his face was lit up so that he hardly\nseemed the same man. There was a flush on his sallow, thin cheeks, and I\nforgot that his voice was harsh and unpleasant. There was even a certain\ncharm about him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By George, I'd like to be in London to-night. Do you know the Pall Mall\nrestaurant? I used to go there a lot. Piccadilly Circus with the shops\nall lit up, and the crowd. I think it's stunning to stand there and\nwatch the buses and taxis streaming along as though they'd never stop.\nAnd I like the Strand too. What are those lines about God and Charing\nCross?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was taken aback.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thompson's, d'you mean?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI quoted them.\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"<i>And when so sad, thou canst not sadder,</i>\n<br>\n<i>Cry, and upon thy so sore loss</i>\n<br>\n<i>Shall shine the traffic of Jacob's ladder</i>\n<br>\n<i>Pitched between Heaven and Charing Cross.</i>\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nHe gave a faint sigh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've read <i>The Hound of Heaven</i>. It's a bit of all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's generally thought so,\" I murmured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't meet anybody here who's read anything. They think it's\nswank.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a wistful look on his face, and I thought I divined the\nfeeling that made him come to me. I was a link with the world he\nregretted and a life that he would know no more. Because not so very\nlong before I had been in the London which he loved, he looked upon me\nwith awe and envy. He had not spoken for five minutes perhaps when he\nbroke out with words that startled me by their intensity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm fed up,\" he said. \"I'm fed up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then why don't you clear out?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis face grew sullen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My lungs are a bit dicky. I couldn't stand an English winter now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment another man joined us on the verandah and Lawson sank\ninto a moody silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's about time for a dram,\" said the newcomer. \"Who'll have a drop of\nScotch with me? Lawson?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLawson seemed to arise from a distant world. He got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let's go down to the bar,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen he left me I remained with a more kindly feeling towards him than I\nshould have expected. He puzzled and interested me. And a few days later\nI met his wife. I knew they had been married for five or six years, and\nI was surprised to see that she was still extremely young. When he\nmarried her she could not have been more than sixteen. She was adorably\npretty. She was no darker than a Spaniard, small and very beautifully\nmade, with tiny hands and feet, and a slight, lithe figure. Her features\nwere lovely; but I think what struck me most was the delicacy of her\nappearance; the half-caste as a rule have a certain coarseness, they\nseem a little roughly formed, but she had an exquisite daintiness which\ntook your breath away. There was something extremely civilised about\nher, so that it surprised you to see her in those surroundings, and you\nthought of those famous beauties who had set all the world talking at\nthe Court of the Emperor Napoleon III. Though she wore but a muslin\nfrock and a straw hat she wore them with an elegance that suggested the\nwoman of fashion. She must have been ravishing when Lawson first saw\nher.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had but lately come out from England to manage the local branch of an\nEnglish bank, and, reaching Samoa at the beginning of the dry season, he\nhad taken a room at the hotel. He quickly made the acquaintance of all\nand sundry. The life of the island is pleasant and easy. He enjoyed the\nlong idle talks in the lounge of the hotel and the gay evenings at the\nEnglish Club when a group of fellows would play pool. He liked Apia\nstraggling along the edge of the lagoon, with its stores and bungalows,\nand its native village. Then there were week-ends when he would ride\nover to the house of one planter or another and spend a couple of nights\non the hills. He had never before known freedom or leisure. And he was\nintoxicated by the sunshine. When he rode through the bush his head\nreeled a little at the beauty that surrounded him. The country was\nindescribably fertile. In parts the forest was still virgin, a tangle of\nstrange trees, luxuriant undergrowth, and vine; it gave an impression\nthat was mysterious and troubling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the spot that entranced him was a pool a mile or two away from Apia\nto which in the evenings he often went to bathe. There was a little\nriver that bubbled over the rocks in a swift stream, and then, after\nforming the deep pool, ran on, shallow and crystalline, past a ford made\nby great stones where the natives came sometimes to bathe or to wash\ntheir clothes. The coconut trees, with their frivolous elegance, grew\nthickly on the banks, all clad with trailing plants, and they were\nreflected in the green water. It was just such a scene as you might see\nin Devonshire among the hills and yet with a difference, for it had a\ntropical richness, a passion, a scented languor which seemed to melt the\nheart. The water was fresh, but not cold; and it was delicious after the\nheat of the day. To bathe there refreshed not only the body but the\nsoul.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt the hour when Lawson went, there was not a soul and he lingered for a\nlong time, now floating idly in the water, now drying himself in the\nevening sun, enjoying the solitude and the friendly silence. He did not\nregret London then, nor the life that he had abandoned, for life as it\nwas seemed complete and exquisite.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was here that he first saw Ethel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOccupied till late by letters which had to be finished for the monthly\nsailing of the boat next day, he rode down one evening to the pool when\nthe light was almost failing. He tied up his horse and sauntered to the\nbank. A girl was sitting there. She glanced round as he came and\nnoiselessly slid into the water. She vanished like a naiad startled by\nthe approach of a mortal. He was surprised and amused. He wondered where\nshe had hidden herself. He swam downstream and presently saw her sitting\non a rock. She looked at him with uncurious eyes. He called out a\ngreeting in Samoan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Talofa.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe answered him, suddenly smiling, and then let herself into the water\nagain. She swam easily and her hair spread out behind her. He watched\nher cross the pool and climb out on the bank. Like all the natives she\nbathed in a Mother Hubbard, and the water had made it cling to her\nslight body. She wrung out her hair, and as she stood there,\nunconcerned, she looked more than ever like a wild creature of the water\nor the woods. He saw now that she was half-caste. He swam towards her\nand, getting out, addressed her in English.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're having a late swim.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shook back her hair and then let it spread over her shoulders in\nluxuriant curls.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I like it when I'm alone,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So do I.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe laughed with the childlike frankness of the native. She slipped a\ndry Mother Hubbard over her head and, letting down the wet one, stepped\nout of it. She wrung it out and was ready to go. She paused a moment\nirresolutely and then sauntered off. The night fell suddenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLawson went back to the hotel and, describing her to the men who were in\nthe lounge shaking dice for drinks, soon discovered who she was. Her\nfather was a Norwegian called Brevald who was often to be seen in the\nbar of the Hotel Metropole drinking rum and water. He was a little old\nman, knotted and gnarled like an ancient tree, who had come out to the\nislands forty years before as mate of a sailing vessel. He had been a\nblacksmith, a trader, a planter, and at one time fairly well-to-do; but,\nruined by the great hurricane of the nineties, he had now nothing to\nlive on but a small plantation of coconut trees. He had had four native\nwives and, as he told you with a cracked chuckle, more children than he\ncould count. But some had died and some had gone out into the world, so\nthat now the only one left at home was Ethel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's a peach,\" said Nelson, the supercargo of the <i>Moana</i>. \"I've given\nher the glad eye once or twice, but I guess there's nothing doing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Old Brevald's not that sort of a fool, sonny,\" put in another, a man\ncalled Miller. \"He wants a son-in-law who's prepared to keep him in\ncomfort for the rest of his life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was distasteful to Lawson that they should speak of the girl in that\nfashion. He made a remark about the departing mail and so distracted\ntheir attention. But next evening he went again to the pool. Ethel was\nthere; and the mystery of the sunset, the deep silence of the water, the\nlithe grace of the coconut trees, added to her beauty, giving it a\nprofundity, a magic, which stirred the heart to unknown emotions. For\nsome reason that time he had the whim not to speak to her. She took no\nnotice of him. She did not even glance in his direction. She swam about\nthe green pool. She dived, she rested on the bank, as though she were\nquite alone: he had a queer feeling that he was invisible. Scraps of\npoetry, half forgotten, floated across his memory, and vague\nrecollections of the Greece he had negligently studied in his school\ndays. When she had changed her wet clothes for dry ones and sauntered\naway he found a scarlet hibiscus where she had been. It was a flower\nthat she had worn in her hair when she came to bathe and, having taken\nit out on getting into the water, had forgotten or not cared to put in\nagain. He took it in his hands and looked at it with a singular emotion.\nHe had an instinct to keep it, but his sentimentality irritated him, and\nhe flung it away. It gave him quite a little pang to see it float down\nthe stream.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe wondered what strangeness it was in her nature that urged her to go\ndown to this hidden pool when there was no likelihood that anyone should\nbe there. The natives of the islands are devoted to the water. They\nbathe, somewhere or other, every day, once always, and often twice; but\nthey bathe in bands, laughing and joyous, a whole family together; and\nyou often saw a group of girls, dappled by the sun shining through the\ntrees, with the half-castes among them, splashing about the shallows of\nthe stream. It looked as though there were in this pool some secret\nwhich attracted Ethel against her will.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow the night had fallen, mysterious and silent, and he let himself down\nin the water softly, in order to make no sound, and swam lazily in the\nwarm darkness. The water seemed fragrant still from her slender body. He\nrode back to the town under the starry sky. He felt at peace with the\nworld.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow he went every evening to the pool and every evening he saw Ethel.\nPresently he overcame her timidity. She became playful and friendly.\nThey sat together on the rocks above the pool, where the water ran fast,\nand they lay side by side on the ledge that overlooked it, watching the\ngathering dusk envelop it with mystery. It was inevitable that their\nmeetings should become known--in the South Seas everyone seems to know\neveryone's business--and he was subjected to much rude chaff by the men\nat the hotel. He smiled and let them talk. It was not even worth while\nto deny their coarse suggestions. His feelings were absolutely pure. He\nloved Ethel as a poet might love the moon. He thought of her not as a\nwoman but as something not of this earth. She was the spirit of the\npool.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne day at the hotel, passing through the bar, he saw that old Brevald,\nas ever in his shabby blue overalls, was standing there. Because he was\nEthel's father he had a desire to speak to him, so he went in, nodded\nand, ordering his own drink, casually turned and invited the old man to\nhave one with him. They chatted for a few minutes of local affairs, and\nLawson was uneasily conscious that the Norwegian was scrutinising him\nwith sly blue eyes. His manner was not agreeable. It was sycophantic,\nand yet behind the cringing air of an old man who had been worsted in\nhis struggle with fate was a shadow of old truculence. Lawson remembered\nthat he had once been captain of a schooner engaged in the slave trade,\na blackbirder they call it in the Pacific, and he had a large hernia in\nthe chest which was the result of a wound received in a scrap with\nSolomon Islanders. The bell rang for luncheon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I must be off,\" said Lawson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why don't you come along to my place one time?\" said Brevald, in his\nwheezy voice. \"It's not very grand, but you'll be welcome. You know\nEthel.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll come with pleasure.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sunday afternoon's the best time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBrevald's bungalow, shabby and bedraggled, stood among the coconut trees\nof the plantation, a little away from the main road that ran up to\nVailima. Immediately around it grew huge plantains. With their tattered\nleaves they had the tragic beauty of a lovely woman in rags. Everything\nwas slovenly and neglected. Little black pigs, thin and high-backed,\nrooted about, and chickens clucked noisily as they picked at the refuse\nscattered here and there. Three or four natives were lounging about the\nverandah. When Lawson asked for Brevald the old man's cracked voice\ncalled out to him, and he found him in the sitting-room smoking an old\nbriar pipe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sit down and make yerself at home,\" he said. \"Ethel's just titivating.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe came in. She wore a blouse and skirt and her hair was done in the\nEuropean fashion. Although she had not the wild, timid grace of the girl\nwho came down every evening to the pool, she seemed now more usual and\nconsequently more approachable. She shook hands with Lawson. It was the\nfirst time he had touched her hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope you'll have a cup of tea with us,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe knew she had been at a mission school, and he was amused, and at the\nsame time touched, by the company manners she was putting on for his\nbenefit. Tea was already set out on the table and in a minute old\nBrevald's fourth wife brought in the tea-pot. She was a handsome native,\nno longer very young, and she spoke but a few words of English. She\nsmiled and smiled. Tea was rather a solemn meal, with a great deal of\nbread and butter and a variety of very sweet cakes, and the conversation\nwas formal. Then a wrinkled old woman came in softly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's Ethel's granny,\" said old Brevald, noisily spitting on the\nfloor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe sat on the edge of a chair, uncomfortably, so that you saw it was\nunusual for her and she would have been more at ease on the ground, and\nremained silently staring at Lawson with fixed, shining eyes. In the\nkitchen behind the bungalow someone began to play the concertina and two\nor three voices were raised in a hymn. But they sang for the pleasure of\nthe sounds rather than from piety.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Lawson walked back to the hotel he was strangely happy. He was\ntouched by the higgledy-piggledy way in which those people lived; and in\nthe smiling good-nature of Mrs. Brevald, in the little Norwegian's\nfantastic career, and in the shining mysterious eyes of the old\ngrandmother he found something unusual and fascinating. It was a more\nnatural life than any he had known, it was nearer to the friendly,\nfertile earth; civilisation repelled him at that moment, and by mere\ncontact with these creatures of a more primitive nature he felt a\ngreater freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe saw himself rid of the hotel which already was beginning to irk him,\nsettled in a little bungalow of his own, trim and white, in front of the\nsea so that he had before his eyes always the multi-coloured variety of\nthe lagoon. He loved the beautiful island. London and England meant\nnothing to him any more, he was content to spend the rest of his days in\nthat forgotten spot, rich in the best of the world's goods, love and\nhappiness. He made up his mind that whatever the obstacles nothing\nshould prevent him from marrying Ethel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut there were no obstacles. He was always welcome at the Brevalds'\nhouse. The old man was ingratiating and Mrs. Brevald smiled without\nceasing. He had brief glimpses of natives who seemed somehow to belong\nto the establishment, and once he found a tall youth in a <i>lava-lava</i>,\nhis body tattooed, his hair white with lime, sitting with Brevald, and\nwas told he was Mrs. Brevald's brother's son; but for the most part they\nkept out of his way. Ethel was delightful with him. The light in her\neyes when she saw him filled him with ecstasy. She was charming and\nnaïve. He listened enraptured when she told him of the mission school at\nwhich she was educated, and of the sisters. He went with her to the\ncinema which was given once a fortnight and danced with her at the dance\nwhich followed it. They came from all parts of the island for this,\nsince gaieties are few in Upolu; and you saw there all the society of\nthe place, the white ladies keeping a good deal to themselves, the\nhalf-castes very elegant in American clothes, the natives, strings of\ndark girls in white Mother Hubbards and young men in unaccustomed ducks\nand white shoes. It was all very smart and gay. Ethel was pleased to\nshow her friends the white admirer who did not leave her side. The\nrumour was soon spread that he meant to marry her and her friends looked\nat her with envy. It was a great thing for a half-caste to get a white\nman to marry her, even the less regular relation was better than\nnothing, but one could never tell what it would lead to; and Lawson's\nposition as manager of the bank made him one of the catches of the\nisland. If he had not been so absorbed in Ethel he would have noticed\nthat many eyes were fixed on him curiously, and he would have seen the\nglances of the white ladies and noticed how they put their heads\ntogether and gossiped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfterwards, when the men who lived at the hotel were having a whisky\nbefore turning in, Nelson burst out with:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Say, they say Lawson's going to marry that girl.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's a damned fool then,\" said Miller.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiller was a German-American who had changed his name from Müller, a big\nman, fat and bald-headed, with a round, clean-shaven face. He wore large\ngold-rimmed spectacles, which gave him a benign look, and his ducks were\nalways clean and white. He was a heavy drinker, invariably ready to stay\nup all night with the \"boys\", but he never got drunk; he was jolly and\naffable, but very shrewd. Nothing interfered with his business; he\nrepresented a firm in San Francisco, jobbers of the goods sold in the\nislands, calico, machinery and what not; and his good-fellowship was\npart of his stock-in-trade.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He don't know what he's up against,\" said Nelson. \"Someone ought to put\nhim wise.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you'll take my advice you won't interfere in what don't concern\nyou,\" said Miller. \"When a man's made up his mind to make a fool of\nhimself, there's nothing like letting him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm all for having a good time with the girls out here, but when it\ncomes to marrying them--this child ain't taking any, I'll tell the\nworld.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nChaplin was there, and now he had his say.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've seen a lot of fellows do it, and it's no good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You ought to have a talk with him, Chaplin,\" said Nelson. \"You know him\nbetter than anyone else does.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My advice to Chaplin is to leave it alone,\" said Miller.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEven in those days Lawson was not popular and really no one took enough\ninterest in him to bother. Mrs. Chaplin talked it over with two or three\nof the white ladies, but they contented themselves with saying that it\nwas a pity; and when he told her definitely that he was going to be\nmarried it seemed too late to do anything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a year Lawson was happy. He took a bungalow at the point of the bay\nround which Apia is built, on the borders of a native village. It\nnestled charmingly among the coconut trees and faced the passionate blue\nof the Pacific. Ethel was lovely as she went about the little house,\nlithe and graceful like some young animal of the woods, and she was gay.\nThey laughed a great deal. They talked nonsense. Sometimes one or two of\nthe men at the hotel would come over and spend the evening, and often on\na Sunday they would go for a day to some planter who had married a\nnative; now and then one or other of the half-caste traders who had a\nstore in Apia would give a party and they went to it. The half-castes\ntreated Lawson quite differently now. His marriage had made him one of\nthemselves and they called him Bertie. They put their arms through his\nand smacked him on the back. He liked to see Ethel at these gatherings.\nHer eyes shone and she laughed. It did him good to see her radiant\nhappiness. Sometimes Ethel's relations would come to the bungalow, old\nBrevald of course, and her mother, but cousins too, vague native women\nin Mother Hubbards and men and boys in <i>lava-lavas</i>, with their hair\ndyed red and their bodies elaborately tattooed. He would find them\nsitting there when he got back from the bank. He laughed indulgently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't let them eat us out of hearth and home,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're my own family. I can't help doing something for them when they\nask me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe knew that when a white man marries a native or a half-caste he must\nexpect her relations to look upon him as a gold mine. He took Ethel's\nface in his hands and kissed her red lips. Perhaps he could not expect\nher to understand that the salary which had amply sufficed for a\nbachelor must be managed with some care when it had to support a wife\nand a house. Then Ethel was delivered of a son.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was when Lawson first held the child in his arms that a sudden pang\nshot through his heart. He had not expected it to be so dark. After all\nit had but a fourth part of native blood, and there was no reason really\nwhy it should not look just like an English baby; but, huddled together\nin his arms, sallow, its head covered already with black hair, with huge\nblack eyes, it might have been a native child. Since his marriage he had\nbeen ignored by the white ladies of the colony. When he came across men\nin whose houses he had been accustomed to dine as a bachelor, they were\na little self-conscious with him; and they sought to cover their\nembarrassment by an exaggerated cordiality.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Lawson well?\" they would say. \"You're a lucky fellow. Damned\npretty girl.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut if they were with their wives and met him and Ethel they would feel\nit awkward when their wives gave Ethel a patronising nod. Lawson had\nlaughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're as dull as ditchwater, the whole gang of them,\" he said. \"It's\nnot going to disturb my night's rest if they don't ask me to their dirty\nparties.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut now it irked him a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe little dark baby screwed up its face. That was his son. He thought\nof the half-caste children in Apia. They had an unhealthy look, sallow\nand pale, and they were odiously precocious. He had seen them on the\nboat going to school in New Zealand, and a school had to be chosen which\ntook children with native blood in them; they were huddled together,\nbrazen and yet timid, with traits which set them apart strangely from\nwhite people. They spoke the native language among themselves. And when\nthey grew up the men accepted smaller salaries because of their native\nblood; girls might marry a white man, but boys had no chance; they must\nmarry a half-caste like themselves or a native. Lawson made up his mind\npassionately that he would take his son away from the humiliation of\nsuch a life. At whatever cost he must get back to Europe. And when he\nwent in to see Ethel, frail and lovely in her bed, surrounded by native\nwomen, his determination was strengthened. If he took her away among his\nown people she would belong more completely to him. He loved her so\npassionately he wanted her to be one soul and one body with him; and he\nwas conscious that here, with those deep roots attaching her to the\nnative life, she would always keep something from him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went to work quietly, urged by an obscure instinct of secrecy, and\nwrote to a cousin who was partner in a shipping firm in Aberdeen, saying\nthat his health (on account of which like so many more he had come out\nto the islands) was so much better, there seemed no reason why he should\nnot return to Europe. He asked him to use what influence he could to get\nhim a job, no matter how poorly paid, on Deeside, where the climate was\nparticularly suitable to such as suffered from diseases of the lungs. It\ntakes five or six weeks for letters to get from Aberdeen to Samoa, and\nseveral had to be exchanged. He had plenty of time to prepare Ethel. She\nwas as delighted as a child. He was amused to see how she boasted to her\nfriends that she was going to England; it was a step up for her; she\nwould be quite English there; and she was excited at the interest the\napproaching departure gave her. When at length a cable came offering him\na post in a bank in Kincardineshire she was beside herself with joy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen, their long journey over, they were settled in the little Scots\ntown with its granite houses Lawson realised how much it meant to him to\nlive once more among his own people. He looked back on the three years\nhe had spent in Apia as exile, and returned to the life that seemed the\nonly normal one with a sigh of relief. It was good to play golf once\nmore, and to fish--to fish properly, that was poor fun in the Pacific\nwhen you just threw in your line and pulled out one big sluggish fish\nafter another from the crowded sea--and it was good to see a paper every\nday with that day's news, and to meet men and women of your own sort,\npeople you could talk to; and it was good to eat meat that was not\nfrozen and to drink milk that was not canned. They were thrown upon\ntheir own resources much more than in the Pacific, and he was glad to\nhave Ethel exclusively to himself. After two years of marriage he loved\nher more devotedly than ever, he could hardly bear her out of his sight,\nand the need in him grew urgent for a more intimate communion between\nthem. But it was strange that after the first excitement of arrival she\nseemed to take less interest in the new life than he had expected. She\ndid not accustom herself to her surroundings. She was a little\nlethargic. As the fine autumn darkened into winter she complained of the\ncold. She lay half the morning in bed and the rest of the day on a sofa,\nreading novels sometimes, but more often doing nothing. She looked\npinched.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never mind, darling,\" he said. \"You'll get used to it very soon. And\nwait till the summer comes. It can be almost as hot as in Apia.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe felt better and stronger than he had done for years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe carelessness with which she managed her house had not mattered in\nSamoa, but here it was out of place. When anyone came he did not want\nthe place to look untidy; and, laughing, chaffing Ethel a little, he set\nabout putting things in order. Ethel watched him indolently. She spent\nlong hours playing with her son. She talked to him in the baby language\nof her own country. To distract her, Lawson bestirred himself to make\nfriends among the neighbours, and now and then they went to little\nparties where the ladies sang drawing-room ballads and the men beamed in\nsilent good nature. Ethel was shy. She seemed to sit apart. Sometimes\nLawson, seized with a sudden anxiety, would ask her if she was happy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I'm quite happy,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut her eyes were veiled by some thought he could not guess. She seemed\nto withdraw into herself so that he was conscious that he knew no more\nof her than when he had first seen her bathing in the pool. He had an\nuneasy feeling that she was concealing something from him, and because\nhe adored her it tortured him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't regret Apia, do you?\" he asked her once.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, no--I think it's very nice here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAn obscure misgiving drove him to make disparaging remarks about the\nisland and the people there. She smiled and did not answer. Very rarely\nshe received a bundle of letters from Samoa and then she went about for\na day or two with a set, pale face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing would induce me ever to go back there,\" he said once. \"It's no\nplace for a white man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he grew conscious that sometimes, when he was away, Ethel cried. In\nApia she had been talkative, chatting volubly about all the little\ndetails of their common life, the gossip of the place; but now she\ngradually became silent, and, though he increased his efforts to amuse\nher, she remained listless. It seemed to him that her recollections of\nthe old life were drawing her away from him, and he was madly jealous of\nthe island and of the sea, of Brevald, and all the dark-skinned people\nwhom he remembered now with horror. When she spoke of Samoa he was\nbitter and satirical. One evening late in the spring when the birch\ntrees were bursting into leaf, coming home from a round of golf, he\nfound her not as usual lying on the sofa, but at the window, standing.\nShe had evidently been waiting for his return. She addressed him the\nmoment he came into the room. To his amazement she spoke in Samoan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't stand it. I can't live here any more. I hate it. I hate it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For God's sake speak in a civilised language,\" he said irritably.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe went up to him and clasped her arms around his body awkwardly, with\na gesture that had in it something barbaric.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let's go away from here. Let's go back to Samoa. If you make me stay\nhere I shall die. I want to go home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer passion broke suddenly and she burst into tears. His anger vanished\nand he drew her down on his knees. He explained to her that it was\nimpossible for him to throw up his job, which after all meant his bread\nand butter. His place in Apia was long since filled. He had nothing to\ngo back to there. He tried to put it to her reasonably, the\ninconveniences of life there, the humiliation to which they must be\nexposed, and the bitterness it must cause their son.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Scotland's wonderful for education and that sort of thing. Schools are\ngood and cheap, and he can go to the University at Aberdeen. I'll make a\nreal Scot of him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey had called him Andrew. Lawson wanted him to become a doctor. He\nwould marry a white woman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not ashamed of being half native,\" Ethel said sullenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course not, darling. There's nothing to be ashamed of.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith her soft cheek against his he felt incredibly weak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't know how much I love you,\" he said. \"I'd give anything in the\nworld to be able to tell you what I've got in my heart.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sought her lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe summer came. The highland valley was green and fragrant and the\nhills were gay with the heather. One sunny day followed another in that\nsheltered spot, and the shade of the birch trees was grateful after the\nglare of the high road. Ethel spoke no more of Samoa and Lawson grew\nless nervous. He thought that she was resigned to her surroundings, and\nhe felt that his love for her was so passionate that it could leave no\nroom in her heart for any longing. One day the local doctor stopped him\nin the street.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, Lawson, your missus ought to be careful how she bathes in our\nhighland streams. It's not like the Pacific, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLawson was surprised, and had not the presence of mind to conceal the\nfact.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know she was bathing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A good many people have seen her. It makes them talk a bit, you know,\nbecause it seems a rum place to choose, the pool up above the bridge,\nand bathing isn't allowed there, but there's no harm in that. I don't\nknow how she can stand the water.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLawson knew the pool the doctor spoke of, and suddenly it occurred to\nhim that in a way it was just like that pool at Upolu where Ethel had\nbeen in the habit of bathing every evening. A clear highland stream ran\ndown a sinuous course, rocky, splashing gaily, and then formed a deep,\nsmooth pool, with a little sandy beach. Trees overshadowed it thickly,\nnot coconut trees, but beeches, and the sun played fitfully through the\nleaves on the sparkling water. It gave him a shock. With his imagination\nhe saw Ethel go there every day and undress on the bank and slip into\nthe water, cold, colder than that of the pool she loved at home, and for\na moment regain the feeling of the past. He saw her once more as the\nstrange, wild spirit of the stream, and it seemed to him fantastically\nthat the running water called her. That afternoon he went along to the\nriver. He made his way cautiously among the trees and the grassy path\ndeadened the sound of his steps. Presently he came to a spot from which\nhe could see the pool. Ethel was sitting on the bank, looking down at\nthe water. She sat quite still. It seemed as though the water drew her\nirresistibly. He wondered what strange thoughts wandered through her\nhead. At last she got up, and for a minute or two she was hidden from\nhis gaze; then he saw her again, wearing a Mother Hubbard, and with her\nlittle bare feet she stepped delicately over the mossy bank. She came to\nthe water's edge, and softly, without a splash, let herself down. She\nswam about quietly, and there was something not quite of a human being\nin the way she swam. He did not know why it affected him so queerly. He\nwaited till she clambered out. She stood for a moment with the wet folds\nof her dress clinging to her body, so that its shape was outlined, and\nthen, passing her hands slowly over her breasts, gave a little sigh of\ndelight. Then she disappeared. Lawson turned away and walked back to the\nvillage. He had a bitter pain in his heart, for he knew that she was\nstill a stranger to him and his hungry love was destined ever to remain\nunsatisfied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not make any mention of what he had seen. He ignored the incident\ncompletely, but he looked at her curiously, trying to divine what was in\nher mind. He redoubled the tenderness with which he used her. He sought\nto make her forget the deep longing of her soul by the passion of his\nlove.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen one day, when he came home, he was astonished to find her not in\nthe house.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where's Mrs. Lawson?\" he asked the maid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She went into Aberdeen, Sir, with the baby,\" the maid answered, a\nlittle surprised at the question. \"She said she would not be back till\nthe last train.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was vexed that Ethel had said nothing to him about the excursion, but\nhe was not disturbed, since of late she had been in now and again to\nAberdeen, and he was glad that she should look at the shops and perhaps\nvisit a cinema. He went to meet the last train, but when she did not\ncome he grew suddenly frightened. He went up to the bedroom and saw at\nonce that her toilet things were no longer in their place. He opened the\nwardrobe and the drawers. They were half empty. She had bolted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was seized with a passion of anger. It was too late that night to\ntelephone to Aberdeen and make enquiries, but he knew already all that\nhis enquiries might have taught him. With fiendish cunning she had\nchosen a time when they were making up their periodical accounts at the\nbank and there was no chance that he could follow her. He was imprisoned\nby his work. He took up a paper and saw that there was a boat sailing\nfor Australia next morning. She must be now well on the way to London.\nHe could not prevent the sobs that were wrung painfully from him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've done everything in the world for her,\" he cried, \"and she had the\nheart to treat me like this. How cruel, how monstrously cruel!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter two days of misery he received a letter from her. It was written\nin her school-girl hand. She had always written with difficulty:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>\nDear Bertie,\n<br>\n&nbsp;\n<br>\n<i>I couldn't stand it any more. I'm going back home. Good-bye.</i>\n<br>\n&nbsp;\n<br>\nEthel.\n</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nShe did not say a single word of regret. She did not even ask him to\ncome too. Lawson was prostrated. He found out where the ship made its\nfirst stop and, though he knew very well she would not come, sent a\ncable beseeching her to return. He waited with pitiful anxiety. He\nwanted her to send him just one word of love; she did not even answer.\nHe passed through one violent phase after another. At one moment he told\nhimself that he was well rid of her, and at the next that he would force\nher to return by withholding money. He was lonely and wretched. He\nwanted his boy and he wanted her. He knew that, whatever he pretended to\nhimself, there was only one thing to do and that was to follow her. He\ncould never live without her now. All his plans for the future were like\na house of cards and he scattered them with angry impatience. He did not\ncare whether he threw away his chances for the future, for nothing in\nthe world mattered but that he should get Ethel back again. As soon as\nhe could he went into Aberdeen and told the manager of his bank that he\nmeant to leave at once. The manager remonstrated. The short notice was\ninconvenient. Lawson would not listen to reason. He was determined to be\nfree before the next boat sailed; and it was not until he was on board\nof her, having sold everything he possessed, that in some measure he\nregained his calm. Till then to those who had come in contact with him\nhe seemed hardly sane. His last action in England was to cable to Ethel\nat Apia that he was joining her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sent another cable from Sydney, and when at last with the dawn his\nboat crossed the bar at Apia and he saw once more the white houses\nstraggling along the bay he felt an immense relief. The doctor came on\nboard and the agent. They were both old acquaintances and he felt kindly\ntowards their familiar faces. He had a drink or two with them for old\ntimes' sake, and also because he was desperately nervous. He was not\nsure if Ethel would be glad to see him. When he got into the launch and\napproached the wharf he scanned anxiously the little crowd that waited.\nShe was not there and his heart sank, but then he saw Brevald, in his\nold blue clothes, and his heart warmed towards him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where's Ethel?\" he said, as he jumped on shore.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's down at the bungalow. She's living with us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLawson was dismayed, but he put on a jovial air.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, have you got room for me? I daresay it'll take a week or two to\nfix ourselves up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, yes, I guess we can make room for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter passing through the custom-house they went to the hotel and there\nLawson was greeted by several of his old friends. There were a good many\nrounds of drinks before it seemed possible to get away and when they did\ngo out at last to Brevald's house they were both rather gay. He clasped\nEthel in his arms. He had forgotten all his bitter thoughts in the joy\nof beholding her once more. His mother-in-law was pleased to see him,\nand so was the old, wrinkled beldame, her mother; natives and\nhalf-castes came in, and they all sat round, beaming on him. Brevald had\na bottle of whisky and everyone who came was given a nip. Lawson sat\nwith his little dark-skinned boy on his knees, they had taken his\nEnglish clothes off him and he was stark, with Ethel by his side in a\nMother Hubbard. He felt like a returning prodigal. In the afternoon he\nwent down to the hotel again and when he got back he was more than gay,\nhe was drunk. Ethel and her mother knew that white men got drunk now and\nthen, it was what you expected of them, and they laughed good-naturedly\nas they helped him to bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut in a day or two he set about looking for a job. He knew that he\ncould not hope for such a position as that which he had thrown away to\ngo to England; but with his training he could not fail to be useful to\none of the trading firms, and perhaps in the end he would not lose by\nthe change.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After all, you can't make money in a bank,\" he said. \"Trade's the\nthing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had hopes that he would soon make himself so indispensable that he\nwould get someone to take him into partnership, and there was no reason\nwhy in a few years he should not be a rich man.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As soon as I'm fixed up we'll find ourselves a shack,\" he told Ethel.\n\"We can't go on living here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBrevald's bungalow was so small that they were all piled on one another,\nand there was no chance of ever being alone. There was neither peace nor\nprivacy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, there's no hurry. We shall be all right here till we find just\nwhat we want.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt took him a week to get settled and then he entered the firm of a man\ncalled Bain. But when he talked to Ethel about moving she said she\nwanted to stay where she was till her baby was born, for she was\nexpecting another child. Lawson tried to argue with her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you don't like it,\" she said, \"go and live at the hotel.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe grew suddenly pale.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ethel, how can you suggest that!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's the good of having a house of our own when we can live here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe yielded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Lawson, after his work, went back to the bungalow he found it\ncrowded with natives. They lay about smoking, sleeping, drinking <i>kava</i>;\nand they talked incessantly. The place was grubby and untidy. His child\ncrawled about, playing with native children, and it heard nothing spoken\nbut Samoan. He fell into the habit of dropping into the hotel on his way\nhome to have a few cocktails, for he could only face the evening and the\ncrowd of friendly natives when he was fortified with liquor. And all the\ntime, though he loved her more passionately than ever, he felt that\nEthel was slipping away from him. When the baby was born he suggested\nthat they should get into a house of their own, but Ethel refused. Her\nstay in Scotland seemed to have thrown her back on her own people, now\nthat she was once more among them, with a passionate zest, and she\nturned to her native ways with abandon. Lawson began to drink more.\nEvery Saturday night he went to the English Club and got blind drunk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had the peculiarity that as he grew drunk he grew quarrelsome and\nonce he had a violent dispute with Bain, his employer. Bain dismissed\nhim, and he had to look out for another job. He was idle for two or\nthree weeks and during these, sooner than sit in the bungalow, he\nlounged about in the hotel or at the English Club, and drank. It was\nmore out of pity than anything else that Miller, the German-American,\ntook him into his office; but he was a business man, and though Lawson's\nfinancial skill made him valuable, the circumstances were such that he\ncould hardly refuse a smaller salary than he had had before, and Miller\ndid not hesitate to offer it to him. Ethel and Brevald blamed him for\ntaking it, since Pedersen, the half-caste, offered him more. But he\nresented bitterly the thought of being under the orders of a half-caste.\nWhen Ethel nagged him he burst out furiously:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll see myself dead before I work for a nigger.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You may have to,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd in six months he found himself forced to this final humiliation. The\npassion for liquor had been gaining on him, he was often heavy with\ndrink, and he did his work badly. Miller warned him once or twice and\nLawson was not the man to accept remonstrance easily. One day in the\nmidst of an altercation he put on his hat and walked out. But by now his\nreputation was well known and he could find no one to engage him. For a\nwhile he idled, and then he had an attack of delirium tremens. When he\nrecovered, shameful and weak, he could no longer resist the constant\npressure and he went to Pedersen and asked him for a job. Pedersen was\nglad to have a white man in his store and Lawson's skill at figures made\nhim useful.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFrom that time his degeneration was rapid. The white people gave him the\ncold shoulder. They were only prevented from cutting him completely by\ndisdainful pity and by a certain dread of his angry violence when he was\ndrunk. He became extremely susceptible and was always on the lookout for\naffront.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe lived entirely among the natives and half-castes, but he had no\nlonger the prestige of the white man. They felt his loathing for them\nand they resented his attitude of superiority. He was one of themselves\nnow and they did not see why he should put on airs. Brevald, who had\nbeen ingratiating and obsequious, now treated him with contempt. Ethel\nhad made a bad bargain. There were disgraceful scenes and once or twice\nthe two men came to blows. When there was a quarrel Ethel took the part\nof her family. They found he was better drunk than sober, for when he\nwas drunk he would lie on the bed or on the floor, sleeping heavily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he became aware that something was being hidden from him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen he got back to the bungalow for the wretched, half-native supper\nwhich was his evening meal, often Ethel was not in. If he asked where\nshe was Brevald told him she had gone to spend the evening with one or\nother of her friends. Once he followed her to the house Brevald had\nmentioned and found she was not there. On her return he asked her where\nshe had been and she told him her father had made a mistake; she had\nbeen to so-and-so's. But he knew that she was lying. She was in her best\nclothes; her eyes were shining, and she looked lovely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't try any monkey tricks on me, my girl,\" he said, \"or I'll break\nevery bone in your body.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You drunken beast,\" she said, scornfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe fancied that Mrs. Brevald and the old grandmother looked at him\nmaliciously and he ascribed Brevald's good-humour with him, so unusual\nthose days, to his satisfaction at having something up his sleeve\nagainst his son-in-law. And then, his suspicions aroused, he imagined\nthat the white men gave him curious glances. When he came into the\nlounge of the hotel the sudden silence which fell upon the company\nconvinced him that he had been the subject of the conversation.\nSomething was going on and everyone knew it but himself. He was seized\nwith furious jealousy. He believed that Ethel was carrying on with one\nof the white men, and he looked at one after the other with scrutinising\neyes; but there was nothing to give him even a hint. He was helpless.\nBecause he could find no one on whom definitely to fix his suspicions,\nhe went about like a raving maniac, looking for someone on whom to vent\nhis wrath. Chance caused him in the end to hit upon the man who of all\nothers least deserved to suffer from his violence. One afternoon, when\nhe was sitting in the hotel by himself, moodily, Chaplin came in and sat\ndown beside him. Perhaps Chaplin was the only man on the island who had\nany sympathy for him. They ordered drinks and chatted a few minutes\nabout the races that were shortly to be run. Then Chaplin said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess we shall all have to fork out money for new dresses.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLawson sniggered. Since Mrs. Chaplin held the purse-strings, if she\nwanted a new frock for the occasion she would certainly not ask her\nhusband for the money.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How is your missus?\" asked Chaplin, desiring to be friendly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the hell's that got to do with you?\" said Lawson, knitting his\ndark brows.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was only asking a civil question.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, keep your civil questions to yourself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nChaplin was not a patient man; his long residence in the tropics, the\nwhisky bottle, and his domestic affairs had given him a temper hardly\nmore under control than Lawson's.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, my boy, when you're in my hotel you behave like a gentleman\nor you'll find yourself in the street before you can say knife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLawson's lowering face grew dark and red.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me just tell you once for all and you can pass it on to the\nothers,\" he said, panting with rage. \"If any of you fellows come messing\nround with my wife he'd better look out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who do you think wants to mess around with your wife?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not such a fool as you think. I can see a stone wall in front of me\nas well as most men, and I warn you straight, that's all. I'm not going\nto put up with any hanky-panky, not on your life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, you'd better clear out of here, and come back when you're\nsober.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall clear out when I choose and not a minute before,\" said Lawson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was an unfortunate boast, for Chaplin in the course of his experience\nas a hotel-keeper had acquired a peculiar skill in dealing with\ngentlemen whose room he preferred to their company, and the words were\nhardly out of Lawson's mouth before he found himself caught by the\ncollar and arm and hustled not without force into the street. He\nstumbled down the steps into the blinding glare of the sun.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was in consequence of this that he had his first violent scene with\nEthel. Smarting with humiliation and unwilling to go back to the hotel,\nhe went home that afternoon earlier than usual. He found Ethel dressing\nto go out. As a rule she lay about in a Mother Hubbard, barefoot, with a\nflower in her dark hair; but now, in white silk stockings and\nhigh-heeled shoes, she was doing up a pink muslin dress which was the\nnewest she had.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're making yourself very smart,\" he said. \"Where are you going?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going to the Crossleys.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll come with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why?\" she asked coolly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want you to gad about by yourself all the time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not asked.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't care a damn about that. You're not going without me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd better lie down till I'm ready.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe thought he was drunk and if he once settled himself on the bed would\nquickly drop off to sleep. He sat down on a chair and began to smoke a\ncigarette. She watched him with increasing irritation. When she was\nready he got up. It happened by an unusual chance that there was no one\nin the bungalow. Brevald was working on the plantation and his wife had\ngone into Apia. Ethel faced him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not going with you. You're drunk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's a lie. You're not going without me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shrugged her shoulders and tried to pass him, but he caught her by\nthe arm and held her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me go, you devil,\" she said, breaking into Samoan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why do you want to go without me? Haven't I told you I'm not going to\nput up with any monkey tricks?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe clenched her fist and hit him in the face. He lost all control of\nhimself. All his love, all his hatred, welled up in him and he was\nbeside himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll teach you,\" he shouted. \"I'll teach you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe seized a riding-whip which happened to be under his hand, and struck\nher with it. She screamed, and the scream maddened him so that he went\non striking her, again and again. Her shrieks rang through the bungalow\nand he cursed her as he hit. Then he flung her on the bed. She lay there\nsobbing with pain and terror. He threw the whip away from him and rushed\nout of the room. Ethel heard him go and she stopped crying. She looked\nround cautiously, then she raised herself. She was sore, but she had not\nbeen badly hurt, and she looked at her dress to see if it was damaged.\nThe native women are not unused to blows. What he had done did not\noutrage her. When she looked at herself in the glass and arranged her\nhair, her eyes were shining. There was a strange look in them. Perhaps\nthen she was nearer loving him than she had ever been before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Lawson, driven forth blindly, stumbled through the plantation and\nsuddenly exhausted, weak as a child, flung himself on the ground at the\nfoot of a tree. He was miserable and ashamed. He thought of Ethel, and\nin the yielding tenderness of his love all his bones seemed to grow soft\nwithin him. He thought of the past, and of his hopes, and he was aghast\nat what he had done. He wanted her more than ever. He wanted to take her\nin his arms. He must go to her at once. He got up. He was so weak that\nhe staggered as he walked. He went into the house and she was sitting in\ntheir cramped bedroom in front of her looking-glass.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Ethel, forgive me. I'm so awfully ashamed of myself. I didn't know\nwhat I was doing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe fell on his knees before her and timidly stroked the skirt of her\ndress.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't bear to think of what I did. It's awful. I think I was mad.\nThere's no one in the world I love as I love you. I'd do anything to\nsave you from pain and I've hurt you. I can never forgive myself, but\nfor God's sake say you forgive me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe heard her shrieks still. It was unendurable. She looked at him\nsilently. He tried to take her hands and the tears streamed from his\neyes. In his humiliation he hid his face in her lap and his frail body\nshook with sobs. An expression of utter contempt came over her face. She\nhad the native woman's disdain of a man who abased himself before a\nwoman. A weak creature! And for a moment she had been on the point of\nthinking there was something in him. He grovelled at her feet like a\ncur. She gave him a little scornful kick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Get out,\" she said. \"I hate you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe tried to hold her, but she pushed him aside. She stood up. She began\nto take off her dress. She kicked off her shoes and slid the stockings\noff her feet, then she slipped on her old Mother Hubbard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where are you going?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's that got to do with you? I'm going down to the pool.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me come too,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe asked as though he were a child.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can't you even leave me that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe hid his face in his hands, crying miserably, while she, her eyes hard\nand cold, stepped past him and went out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFrom that time she entirely despised him; and though, herded together in\nthe small bungalow, Lawson and Ethel with her two children, Brevald, his\nwife and her mother, and the vague relations and hangers-on who were\nalways in and about, they had to live cheek by jowl, Lawson, ceasing to\nbe of any account, was hardly noticed. He left in the morning after\nbreakfast, and came back only to have supper. He gave up the struggle,\nand when for want of money he could not go to the English Club he spent\nthe evening playing hearts with old Brevald and the natives. Except when\nhe was drunk he was cowed and listless. Ethel treated him like a dog.\nShe submitted at times to his fits of wild passion, and she was\nfrightened by the gusts of hatred with which they were followed; but\nwhen, afterwards, he was cringing and lachrymose she had such a contempt\nfor him that she could have spat in his face. Sometimes he was violent,\nbut now she was prepared for him, and when he hit her she kicked and\nscratched and bit. They had horrible battles in which he had not always\nthe best of it. Very soon it was known all over Apia that they got on\nbadly. There was little sympathy for Lawson, and at the hotel the\ngeneral surprise was that old Brevald did not kick him out of the place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Brevald's a pretty ugly customer,\" said one of the men. \"I shouldn't be\nsurprised if he put a bullet into Lawson's carcass one of these days.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEthel still went in the evenings to bathe in the silent pool. It seemed\nto have an attraction for her that was not quite human, just that\nattraction you might imagine that a mermaid who had won a soul would\nhave for the cool salt waves of the sea; and sometimes Lawson went also.\nI do not know what urged him to go, for Ethel was obviously irritated by\nhis presence; perhaps it was because in that spot he hoped to regain the\nclean rapture which had filled his heart when first he saw her; perhaps\nonly, with the madness of those who love them that love them not, from\nthe feeling that his obstinacy could force love. One day he strolled\ndown there with a feeling that was rare with him now. He felt suddenly\nat peace with the world. The evening was drawing in and the dusk seemed\nto cling to the leaves of the coconut trees like a little thin cloud. A\nfaint breeze stirred them noiselessly. A crescent moon hung just over\ntheir tops. He made his way to the bank. He saw Ethel in the water\nfloating on her back. Her hair streamed out all round her, and she was\nholding in her hand a large hibiscus. He stopped a moment to admire her;\nshe was like Ophelia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa, Ethel,\" he cried joyfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe made a sudden movement and dropped the red flower. It floated idly\naway. She swam a stroke or two till she knew there was ground within her\ndepth and then stood up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go away,\" she said. \"Go away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be selfish. There's plenty of room for both of us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why can't you leave me alone? I want to be by myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hang it all, I want to bathe,\" he answered, good-humouredly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go down to the bridge. I don't want you here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry for that,\" he said, smiling still.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was not in the least angry, and he hardly noticed that she was in a\npassion. He began to take off his coat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go away,\" she shrieked. \"I won't have you here. Can't you even leave me\nthis? Go away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be silly, darling.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe bent down and picked up a sharp stone and flung it quickly at him.\nHe had no time to duck. It hit him on the temple. With a cry he put his\nhand to his head and when he took it away it was wet with blood. Ethel\nstood still, panting with rage. He turned very pale, and without a word,\ntaking up his coat, went away. Ethel let herself fall back into the\nwater and the stream carried her slowly down to the ford.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe stone had made a jagged wound and for some days Lawson went about\nwith a bandaged head. He had invented a likely story to account for the\naccident when the fellows at the club asked him about it, but he had no\noccasion to use it. No one referred to the matter. He saw them cast\nsurreptitious glances at his head, but not a word was said. The silence\ncould only mean that they knew how he came by his wound. He was certain\nnow that Ethel had a lover, and they all knew who it was. But there was\nnot the smallest indication to guide him. He never saw Ethel with\nanyone; no one showed a wish to be with her, or treated him in a manner\nthat seemed strange. Wild rage seized him, and having no one to vent it\non he drank more and more heavily. A little while before I came to the\nisland he had had another attack of delirium tremens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI met Ethel at the house of a man called Caster, who lived two or three\nmiles from Apia with a native wife. I had been playing tennis with him\nand when we were tired he suggested a cup of tea. We went into the house\nand in the untidy living-room found Ethel chatting with Mrs. Caster.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa, Ethel,\" he said, \"I didn't know you were here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI could not help looking at her with curiosity. I tried to see what\nthere was in her to have excited in Lawson such a devastating passion.\nBut who can explain these things? It was true that she was lovely; she\nreminded one of the red hibiscus, the common flower of the hedgerow in\nSamoa, with its grace and its languor and its passion; but what\nsurprised me most, taking into consideration the story I knew even then\na good deal of, was her freshness and simplicity. She was quiet and a\nlittle shy. There was nothing coarser or loud about her; she had not the\nexuberance common to the half-caste; and it was almost impossible to\nbelieve that she could be the virago that the horrible scenes between\nhusband and wife, which were now common knowledge, indicated. In her\npretty pink frock and high-heeled shoes she looked quite European. You\ncould hardly have guessed at that dark background of native life in\nwhich she felt herself so much more at home. I did not imagine that she\nwas at all intelligent, and I should not have been surprised if a man,\nafter living with her for some time, had found the passion which had\ndrawn him to her sink into boredom. It suggested itself to me that in\nher elusiveness, like a thought that presents itself to consciousness\nand vanishes before it can be captured by words, lay her peculiar charm;\nbut perhaps that was merely fancy, and if I had known nothing about her\nI should have seen in her only a pretty little half-caste like another.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe talked to me of the various things which they talk of to the\nstranger in Samoa, of the journey, and whether I had slid down the water\nrock at Papaseea, and if I meant to stay in a native village. She talked\nto me of Scotland, and perhaps I noticed in her a tendency to enlarge on\nthe sumptuousness of her establishment there. She asked me naïvely if I\nknew Mrs. This and Mrs. That, with whom she had been acquainted when she\nlived in the north.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen Miller, the fat German-American, came in. He shook hands all round\nvery cordially and sat down, asking in his loud, cheerful voice for a\nwhisky and soda. He was very fat and he sweated profusely. He took off\nhis gold-rimmed spectacles and wiped them; you saw then that his little\neyes, benevolent behind the large round glasses, were shrewd and\ncunning; the party had been somewhat dull till he came, but he was a\ngood story-teller and a jovial fellow. Soon he had the two women, Ethel\nand my friend's wife, laughing delightedly at his sallies. He had a\nreputation on the island of a lady's man, and you could see how this\nfat, gross fellow, old and ugly, had yet the possibility of fascination.\nHis humour was on a level with the understanding of his company, an\naffair of vitality and assurance, and his Western accent gave a peculiar\npoint to what he said. At last he turned to me:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if we want to get back for dinner we'd better be getting. I'll\ntake you along in my machine if you like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI thanked him and got up. He shook hands with the others, went out of\nthe room, massive and strong in his walk, and climbed into his car.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pretty little thing, Lawson's wife,\" I said, as we drove along.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Too bad the way he treats her. Knocks her about. Gets my dander up when\nI hear of a man hitting a woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe went on a little. Then he said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was a darned fool to marry her. I said so at the time. If he hadn't,\nhe'd have had the whip hand over her. He's yaller, that's what he is,\nyaller.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe year was drawing to its end and the time approached when I was to\nleave Samoa. My boat was scheduled to sail for Sydney on the fourth of\nJanuary. Christmas Day had been celebrated at the hotel with suitable\nceremonies, but it was looked upon as no more than a rehearsal for New\nYear, and the men who were accustomed to foregather in the lounge\ndetermined on New Year's Eve to make a night of it. There was an\nuproarious dinner, after which the party sauntered down to the English\nClub, a simple little frame house, to play pool. There was a great deal\nof talking, laughing, and betting, but some very poor play, except on\nthe part of Miller, who had drunk as much as any of them, all far\nyounger than he, but had kept unimpaired the keenness of his eye and the\nsureness of his hand. He pocketed the young men's money with humour and\nurbanity. After an hour of this I grew tired and went out. I crossed the\nroad and came on to the beach. Three coconut trees grew there, like\nthree moon maidens waiting for their lovers to ride out of the sea, and\nI sat at the foot of one of them, watching the lagoon and the nightly\nassemblage of the stars.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI do not know where Lawson had been during the evening, but between ten\nand eleven he came along to the club. He shambled down the dusty, empty\nroad, feeling dull and bored, and when he reached the club, before going\ninto the billiard-room, went into the bar to have a drink by himself. He\nhad a shyness now about joining the company of white men when there were\na lot of them together and needed a stiff dose of whisky to give him\nconfidence. He was standing with the glass in his hand when Miller came\nin to him. He was in his shirt-sleeves and still held his cue. He gave\nthe bar-tender a glance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Get out, Jack,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe bar-tender, a native in a white jacket and a red lava-lava, without\na word slid out of the small room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, I've been wanting to have a few words with you, Lawson,\"\nsaid the big American.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, that's one of the few things you can have free, gratis, and for\nnothing on this damned island.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiller fixed his gold spectacles more firmly on his nose and held Lawson\nwith his cold determined eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"See here, young fellow, I understand you've been knocking Mrs. Lawson\nabout again. I'm not going to stand for that. If you don't stop it right\nnow I'll break every bone of your dirty little body.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen Lawson knew what he had been trying to find out so long. It was\nMiller. The appearance of the man, fat, bald-headed, with his round bare\nface and double chin and the gold spectacles, his age, his benign,\nshrewd look, like that of a renegade priest, and the thought of Ethel,\nso slim and virginal, filled him with a sudden horror. Whatever his\nfaults Lawson was no coward, and without a word he hit out violently at\nMiller. Miller quickly warded the blow with the hand that held the cue,\nand then with a great swing of his right arm brought his fist down on\nLawson's ear. Lawson was four inches shorter than the American and he\nwas slightly built, frail and weakened not only by illness and the\nenervating tropics, but by drink. He fell like a log and lay half dazed\nat the foot of the bar. Miller took off his spectacles and wiped them\nwith his handkerchief.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess you know what to expect now. You've had your warning and you'd\nbetter take it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took up his cue and went back into the billiard-room. There was so\nmuch noise there that no one knew what had happened. Lawson picked\nhimself up. He put his hand to his ear, which was singing still. Then he\nslunk out of the club.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI saw a man cross the road, a patch of white against the darkness of the\nnight, but did not know who it was. He came down to the beach, passed me\nsitting at the foot of the tree, and looked down. I saw then that it was\nLawson, but since he was doubtless drunk, did not speak. He went on,\nwalked irresolutely two or three steps, and turned back. He came up to\nme and bending down stared in my face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought it was you,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sat down and took out his pipe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was hot and noisy in the club,\" I volunteered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why are you sitting here?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was waiting about for the midnight mass at the Cathedral.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you like I'll come with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLawson was quite sober. We sat for a while smoking in silence. Now and\nthen in the lagoon was the splash of some big fish, and a little way out\ntowards the opening in the reef was the light of a schooner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're sailing next week, aren't you?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be jolly to go home once more. But I could never stand it now.\nThe cold, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's odd to think that in England now they're shivering round the\nfire,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was not even a breath of wind. The balminess of the night was like\na spell. I wore nothing but a thin shirt and a suit of ducks. I enjoyed\nthe exquisite languor of the night, and stretched my limbs voluptuously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This isn't the sort of New Year's Eve that persuades one to make good\nresolutions for the future,\" I smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe made no answer, but I do not know what train of thought my casual\nremark had suggested in him, for presently he began to speak. He spoke\nin a low voice, without any expression, but his accents were educated,\nand it was a relief to hear him after the twang and the vulgar\nintonations which for some time had wounded my ears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've made an awful hash of things. That's obvious, isn't it? I'm right\ndown at the bottom of the pit and there's no getting out for me. '<i>Black\nas the pit from pole to pole.</i>'\" I felt him smile as he made the\nquotation. \"And the strange thing is that I don't see how I went wrong.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI held my breath, for to me there is nothing more awe-inspiring than\nwhen a man discovers to you the nakedness of his soul. Then you see that\nno one is so trivial or debased but that in him is a spark of something\nto excite compassion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It wouldn't be so rotten if I could see that it was all my own fault.\nIt's true I drink, but I shouldn't have taken to that if things had gone\ndifferently. I wasn't really fond of liquor. I suppose I ought not to\nhave married Ethel. If I'd kept her it would be all right. But I did\nlove her so.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis voice faltered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's not a bad lot, you know, not really. It's just rotten luck. We\nmight have been as happy as lords. When she bolted I suppose I ought to\nhave let her go, but I couldn't do that--I was dead stuck on her then;\nand there was the kid.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you fond of the kid?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was. There are two, you know. But they don't mean so much to me now.\nYou'd take them for natives anywhere. I have to talk to them in Samoan.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it too late for you to start fresh? Couldn't you make a dash for it\nand leave the place?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't the strength. I'm done for.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you still in love with your wife?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not now. Not now.\" He repeated the two words with a kind of horror in\nhis voice. \"I haven't even got that now. I'm down and out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe bells of the Cathedral were ringing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you really want to come to the midnight mass we'd better go along,\"\nI said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come on.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe got up and walked along the road. The Cathedral, all white, stood\nfacing the sea not without impressiveness, and beside it the Protestant\nchapels had the look of meeting-houses. In the road were two or three\ncars, and a great number of traps, and traps were put up against the\nwalls at the side. People had come from all parts of the island for the\nservice, and through the great open doors we saw that the place was\ncrowded. The high altar was all ablaze with light. There were a few\nwhites and a good many half-castes, but the great majority were natives.\nAll the men wore trousers, for the Church has decided that the lava-lava\nis indecent. We found chairs at the back, near the open door, and sat\ndown. Presently, following Lawson's eyes, I saw Ethel come in with a\nparty of half-castes. They were all very much dressed up, the men in\nhigh, stiff collars and shiny boots, the women in large, gay hats. Ethel\nnodded and smiled to her friends as she passed up the aisle. The service\nbegan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen it was over Lawson and I stood on one side for a while to watch the\ncrowd stream out, then he held out his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-night,\" he said. \"I hope you'll have a pleasant journey home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, but I shall see you before I go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sniggered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The question is if you'll see me drunk or sober.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned and left me. I had a recollection of those very large black\neyes, shining wildly under the shaggy brows. I paused irresolutely. I\ndid not feel sleepy and I thought I would at all events go along to the\nclub for an hour before turning in. When I got there I found the\nbilliard-room empty, but half-a-dozen men were sitting round a table in\nthe lounge, playing poker. Miller looked up as I came in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sit down and take a hand,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI bought some chips and began to play. Of course it is the most\nfascinating game in the world and my hour lengthened out to two, and\nthen to three. The native bar-tender, cheery and wide-awake\nnotwithstanding the time, was at our elbow to supply us with drinks and\nfrom somewhere or other he produced a ham and a loaf of bread. We played\non. Most of the party had drunk more than was good for them and the play\nwas high and reckless. I played modestly, neither wishing to win nor\nanxious to lose, but I watched Miller with a fascinated interest. He\ndrank glass for glass with the rest of the company, but remained cool\nand level-headed. His pile of chips increased in size and he had a neat\nlittle paper in front of him on which he had marked various sums lent to\nplayers in distress. He beamed amiably at the young men whose money he\nwas taking. He kept up interminably his stream of jest and anecdote, but\nhe never missed a draw, he never let an expression of the face pass him.\nAt last the dawn crept into the windows, gently, with a sort of\ndeprecating shyness, as though it had no business there, and then it was\nday.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well,\" said Miller, \"I reckon we've seen the old year out in style. Now\nlet's have a round of jackpots and me for my mosquito net. I'm fifty,\nremember, I can't keep these late hours.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe morning was beautiful and fresh when we stood on the verandah, and\nthe lagoon was like a sheet of multicoloured glass. Someone suggested a\ndip before going to bed, but none cared to bathe in the lagoon, sticky\nand treacherous to the feet. Miller had his car at the door and he\noffered to take us down to the pool. We jumped in and drove along the\ndeserted road. When we reached the pool it seemed as though the day had\nhardly risen there yet. Under the trees the water was all in shadow and\nthe night had the effects of lurking still. We were in great spirits. We\nhad no towels or any costume and in my prudence I wondered how we were\ngoing to dry ourselves. None of us had much on and it did not take us\nlong to snatch off our clothes. Nelson, the little supercargo, was\nstripped first.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going down to the bottom,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe dived and in a moment another man dived too, but shallow, and was out\nof the water before him. Then Nelson came up and scrambled to the side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, get me out,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's up?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSomething was evidently the matter. His face was terrified. Two fellows\ngave him their hands and he slithered up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, there's a man down there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be a fool. You're drunk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if there isn't I'm in for D.T.s. But I tell you there's a man\ndown there. It just scared me out of my wits.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiller looked at him for a moment. The little man was all white. He was\nactually trembling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come on, Caster,\" said Miller to the big Australian, \"we'd better go\ndown and see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was standing up,\" said Nelson, \"all dressed. I saw him. He tried to\ncatch hold of me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hold your row,\" said Miller. \"Are you ready?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey dived in. We waited on the bank, silent. It really seemed as though\nthey were under water longer than any men could breathe. Then Caster\ncame up, and immediately after him, red in the face as though he were\ngoing to have a fit, Miller. They were pulling something behind them.\nAnother man jumped in to help them, and the three together dragged their\nburden to the side. They shoved it up. Then we saw that it was Lawson,\nwith a great stone tied up in his coat and bound to his feet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was set on making a good job of it,\" said Miller, as he wiped the\nwater from his short-sighted eyes.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nHe splashed about for a few minutes in the sea; it was too shallow to\nswim in and for fear of sharks he could not go out of his depth; then he\ngot out and went into the bath-house for a shower. The coldness of the\nfresh water was grateful after the heavy stickiness of the salt Pacific,\nso warm, though it was only just after seven, that to bathe in it did\nnot brace you but rather increased your languor; and when he had dried\nhimself, slipping into a bath-gown, he called out to the Chinese cook\nthat he would be ready for breakfast in five minutes. He walked barefoot\nacross the patch of coarse grass which Walker, the administrator,\nproudly thought was a lawn, to his own quarters and dressed. This did\nnot take long, for he put on nothing but a shirt and a pair of duck\ntrousers and then went over to his chief's house on the other side of\nthe compound. The two men had their meals together, but the Chinese cook\ntold him that Walker had set out on horseback at five and would not be\nback for another hour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh had slept badly and he looked with distaste at the paw-paw\nand the eggs and bacon which were set before him. The mosquitoes had\nbeen maddening that night; they flew about the net under which he slept\nin such numbers that their humming, pitiless and menacing, had the\neffect of a note, infinitely drawn out, played on a distant organ, and\nwhenever he dozed off he awoke with a start in the belief that one had\nfound its way inside his curtains. It was so hot that he lay naked. He\nturned from side to side. And gradually the dull roar of the breakers on\nthe reef, so unceasing and so regular that generally you did not hear\nit, grew distinct on his consciousness, its rhythm hammered on his tired\nnerves and he held himself with clenched hands in the effort to bear it.\nThe thought that nothing could stop that sound, for it would continue to\nall eternity, was almost impossible to bear, and, as though his strength\nwere a match for the ruthless forces of nature, he had an insane impulse\nto do some violent thing. He felt he must cling to his self-control or\nhe would go mad. And now, looking out of the window at the lagoon and\nthe strip of foam which marked the reef, he shuddered with hatred of the\nbrilliant scene. The cloudless sky was like an inverted bowl that hemmed\nit in. He lit his pipe and turned over the pile of Auckland papers that\nhad come over from Apia a few days before. The newest of them was three\nweeks old. They gave an impression of incredible dullness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he went into the office. It was a large, bare room with two desks\nin it and a bench along one side. A number of natives were seated on\nthis, and a couple of women. They gossiped while they waited for the\nadministrator, and when Mackintosh came in they greeted him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Talofa-li.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe returned their greeting and sat down at his desk. He began to write,\nworking on a report which the governor of Samoa had been clamouring for\nand which Walker, with his usual dilatoriness, had neglected to prepare.\nMackintosh as he made his notes reflected vindictively that Walker was\nlate with his report because he was so illiterate that he had an\ninvincible distaste for anything to do with pens and paper; and now when\nit was at last ready, concise and neatly official, he would accept his\nsubordinate's work without a word of appreciation, with a sneer rather\nor a gibe, and send it on to his own superior as though it were his own\ncomposition. He could not have written a word of it. Mackintosh thought\nwith rage that if his chief pencilled in some insertion it would be\nchildish in expression and faulty in language. If he remonstrated or\nsought to put his meaning into an intelligible phrase, Walker would fly\ninto a passion and cry:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the hell do I care about grammar? That's what I want to say and\nthat's how I want to say it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last Walker came in. The natives surrounded him as he entered, trying\nto get his immediate attention, but he turned on them roughly and told\nthem to sit down and hold their tongues. He threatened that if they were\nnot quiet he would have them all turned out and see none of them that\nday. He nodded to Mackintosh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa, Mac; up at last? I don't know how you can waste the best part\nof the day in bed. You ought to have been up before dawn like me. Lazy\nbeggar.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe threw himself heavily into his chair and wiped his face with a large\nbandana.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By heaven, I've got a thirst.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned to the policeman who stood at the door, a picturesque figure\nin his white jacket and lava-lava, the loincloth of the Samoan, and told\nhim to bring kava. The kava bowl stood on the floor in the corner of the\nroom, and the policeman filled a half coconut shell and brought it to\nWalker. He poured a few drops on the ground, murmured the customary\nwords to the company, and drank with relish. Then he told the policeman\nto serve the waiting natives, and the shell was handed to each one in\norder of birth or importance and emptied with the same ceremonies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he set about the day's work. He was a little man, considerably less\nthan of middle height, and enormously stout; he had a large, fleshy\nface, clean-shaven, with the cheeks hanging on each side in great\ndew-laps, and three vast chins; his small features were all dissolved in\nfat; and, but for a crescent of white hair at the back of his head, he\nwas completely bald. He reminded you of Mr. Pickwick. He was grotesque,\na figure of fun, and yet, strangely enough, not without dignity. His\nblue eyes, behind large gold-rimmed spectacles, were shrewd and\nvivacious, and there was a great deal of determination in his face. He\nwas sixty, but his native vitality triumphed over advancing years.\nNotwithstanding his corpulence his movements were quick, and he walked\nwith a heavy, resolute tread as though he sought to impress his weight\nupon the earth. He spoke in a loud, gruff voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was two years now since Mackintosh had been appointed Walker's\nassistant. Walker, who had been for a quarter of a century administrator\nof Talua, one of the larger islands in the Samoan group, was a man known\nin person or by report through the length and breadth of the South Seas;\nand it was with lively curiosity that Mackintosh looked forward to his\nfirst meeting with him. For one reason or another he stayed a couple of\nweeks at Apia before he took up his post and both at Chaplin's hotel and\nat the English Club he heard innumerable stories about the\nadministrator. He thought now with irony of his interest in them. Since\nthen he had heard them a hundred times from Walker himself. Walker knew\nthat he was a character and, proud of his reputation, deliberately acted\nup to it. He was jealous of his \"legend\" and anxious that you should\nknow the exact details of any of the celebrated stories that were told\nof him. He was ludicrously angry with anyone who had told them to the\nstranger incorrectly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a rough cordiality about Walker which Mackintosh at first\nfound not unattractive, and Walker, glad to have a listener to whom all\nhe said was fresh, gave of his best. He was good-humoured, hearty, and\nconsiderate. To Mackintosh, who had lived the sheltered life of a\ngovernment official in London till at the age of thirty-four an attack\nof pneumonia, leaving him with the threat of tuberculosis, had forced\nhim to seek a post in the Pacific, Walker's existence seemed\nextraordinarily romantic. The adventure with which he started on his\nconquest of circumstance was typical of the man. He ran away to sea when\nhe was fifteen and for over a year was employed in shovelling coal on a\ncollier. He was an undersized boy and both men and mates were kind to\nhim, but the captain for some reason conceived a savage dislike of him.\nHe used the lad cruelly so that, beaten and kicked, he often could not\nsleep for the pain that racked his limbs. He loathed the captain with\nall his soul. Then he was given a tip for some race and managed to\nborrow twenty-five pounds from a friend he had picked up in Belfast. He\nput it on the horse, an outsider, at long odds. He had no means of\nrepaying the money if he lost, but it never occurred to him that he\ncould lose. He felt himself in luck. The horse won and he found himself\nwith something over a thousand pounds in hard cash. Now his chance had\ncome. He found out who was the best solicitor in the town--the collier\nlay then somewhere on the Irish coast--went to him, and, telling him\nthat he heard the ship was for sale, asked him to arrange the purchase\nfor him. The solicitor was amused at his small client, he was only\nsixteen and did not look so old, and, moved perhaps by sympathy,\npromised not only to arrange the matter for him but to see that he made\na good bargain. After a little while Walker found himself the owner of\nthe ship. He went back to her and had what he described as the most\nglorious moment of his life when he gave the skipper notice and told him\nthat he must get off <i>his</i> ship in half an hour. He made the mate\ncaptain and sailed on the collier for another nine months, at the end of\nwhich he sold her at a profit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe came out to the islands at the age of twenty-six as a planter. He was\none of the few white men settled in Talua at the time of the German\noccupation and had then already some influence with the natives. The\nGermans made him administrator, a position which he occupied for twenty\nyears, and when the island was seized by the British he was confirmed in\nhis post. He ruled the island despotically, but with complete success.\nThe prestige of this success was another reason for the interest that\nMackintosh took in him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the two men were not made to get on. Mackintosh was an ugly man,\nwith ungainly gestures, a tall thin fellow, with a narrow chest and\nbowed shoulders. He had sallow, sunken cheeks, and his eyes were large\nand sombre. He was a great reader, and when his books arrived and were\nunpacked Walker came over to his quarters and looked at them. Then he\nturned to Mackintosh with a coarse laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What in Hell have you brought all this muck for?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh flushed darkly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry you think it muck. I brought my books because I want to read\nthem.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When you said you'd got a lot of books coming I thought there'd be\nsomething for me to read. Haven't you got any detective stories?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Detective stories don't interest me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're a damned fool then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm content that you should think so.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEvery mail brought Walker a mass of periodical literature, papers from\nNew Zealand and magazines from America, and it exasperated him that\nMackintosh showed his contempt for these ephemeral publications. He had\nno patience with the books that absorbed Mackintosh's leisure and\nthought it only a pose that he read Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall</i> or\nBurton's <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>. And since he had never learned to put\nany restraint on his tongue, he expressed his opinion of his assistant\nfreely. Mackintosh began to see the real man, and under the boisterous\ngood-humour he discerned a vulgar cunning which was hateful; he was vain\nand domineering, and it was strange that he had notwithstanding a\nshyness which made him dislike people who were not quite of his kidney.\nHe judged others, naïvely, by their language, and if it was free from\nthe oaths and the obscenity which made up the greater part of his own\nconversation, he looked upon them with suspicion. In the evening the two\nmen played piquet. He played badly but vaingloriously, crowing over his\nopponent when he won and losing his temper when he lost. On rare\noccasions a couple of planters or traders would drive over to play\nbridge, and then Walker showed himself in what Mackintosh considered a\ncharacteristic light. He played regardless of his partner, calling up in\nhis desire to play the hand, and argued interminably, beating down\nopposition by the loudness of his voice. He constantly revoked, and when\nhe did so said with an ingratiating whine: \"Oh, you wouldn't count it\nagainst an old man who can hardly see.\" Did he know that his opponents\nthought it as well to keep on the right side of him and hesitated to\ninsist on the rigour of the game? Mackintosh watched him with an icy\ncontempt. When the game was over, while they smoked their pipes and\ndrank whisky, they would begin telling stories. Walker told with gusto\nthe story of his marriage. He had got so drunk at the wedding feast that\nthe bride had fled and he had never seen her since. He had had\nnumberless adventures, commonplace and sordid, with the women of the\nisland and he described them with a pride in his own prowess which was\nan offence to Mackintosh's fastidious ears. He was a gross, sensual old\nman. He thought Mackintosh a poor fellow because he would not share his\npromiscuous amours and remained sober when the company was drunk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe despised him also for the orderliness with which he did his official\nwork. Mackintosh liked to do everything just so. His desk was always\ntidy, his papers were always neatly docketed, he could put his hand on\nany document that was needed, and he had at his fingers' ends all the\nregulations that were required for the business of their administration.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fudge, fudge,\" said Walker. \"I've run this island for twenty years\nwithout red tape, and I don't want it now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does it make it any easier for you that when you want a letter you have\nto hunt half an hour for it?\" answered Mackintosh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're nothing but a damned official. But you're not a bad fellow; when\nyou've been out here a year or two you'll be all right. What's wrong\nabout you is that you won't drink. You wouldn't be a bad sort if you got\nsoused once a week.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe curious thing was that Walker remained perfectly unconscious of the\ndislike for him which every month increased in the breast of his\nsubordinate. Although he laughed at him, as he grew accustomed to him,\nhe began almost to like him. He had a certain tolerance for the\npeculiarities of others, and he accepted Mackintosh as a queer fish.\nPerhaps he liked him, unconsciously, because he could chaff him. His\nhumour consisted of coarse banter and he wanted a butt. Mackintosh's\nexactness, his morality, his sobriety, were all fruitful subjects; his\nScots name gave an opportunity for the usual jokes about Scotland; he\nenjoyed himself thoroughly when two or three men were there and he could\nmake them all laugh at the expense of Mackintosh. He would say\nridiculous things about him to the natives, and Mackintosh, his\nknowledge of Samoan still imperfect, would see their unrestrained mirth\nwhen Walker had made an obscene reference to him. He smiled\ngood-humouredly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll say this for you, Mac,\" Walker would say in his gruff loud voice,\n\"you can take a joke.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Was it a joke?\" smiled Mackintosh. \"I didn't know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Scots wha hae!\" shouted Walker, with a bellow of laughter. \"There's\nonly one way to make a Scotchman see a joke and that's by a surgical\noperation.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWalker little knew that there was nothing Mackintosh could stand less\nthan chaff. He would wake in the night, the breathless night of the\nrainy season, and brood sullenly over the gibe that Walker had uttered\ncarelessly days before. It rankled. His heart swelled with rage, and he\npictured to himself ways in which he might get even with the bully. He\nhad tried answering him, but Walker had a gift of repartee, coarse and\nobvious, which gave him an advantage. The dullness of his intellect made\nhim impervious to a delicate shaft. His self-satisfaction made it\nimpossible to wound him. His loud voice, his bellow of laughter, were\nweapons against which Mackintosh had nothing to counter, and he learned\nthat the wisest thing was never to betray his irritation. He learned to\ncontrol himself. But his hatred grew till it was a monomania. He watched\nWalker with an insane vigilance. He fed his own self-esteem by every\ninstance of meanness on Walker's part, by every exhibition of childish\nvanity, of cunning and of vulgarity. Walker ate greedily, noisily,\nfilthily, and Mackintosh watched him with satisfaction. He took note of\nthe foolish things he said and of his mistakes in grammar. He knew that\nWalker held him in small esteem, and he found a bitter satisfaction in\nhis chief's opinion of him; it increased his own contempt for the\nnarrow, complacent old man. And it gave him a singular pleasure to know\nthat Walker was entirely unconscious of the hatred he felt for him. He\nwas a fool who liked popularity, and he blandly fancied that everyone\nadmired him. Once Mackintosh had overheard Walker speaking of him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He'll be all right when I've licked him into shape,\" he said. \"He's a\ngood dog and he loves his master.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh silently, without a movement of his long, sallow face,\nlaughed long and heartily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut his hatred was not blind; on the contrary, it was peculiarly\nclear-slighted, and he judged Walker's capabilities with precision. He\nruled his small kingdom with efficiency. He was just and honest. With\nopportunities to make money he was a poorer man than when he was first\nappointed to his post, and his only support for his old age was the\npension which he expected when at last he retired from official life.\nHis pride was that with an assistant and a half-caste clerk he was able\nto administer the island more competently than Upolu, the island of\nwhich Apia is the chief town, was administered with its army of\nfunctionaries. He had a few native policemen to sustain his authority,\nbut he made no use of them. He governed by bluff and his Irish humour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They insisted on building a jail for me,\" he said. \"What the devil do I\nwant a jail for? I'm not going to put the natives in prison. If they do\nwrong I know how to deal with them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne of his quarrels with the higher authorities at Apia was that he\nclaimed entire jurisdiction over the natives of his island. Whatever\ntheir crimes he would not give them up to courts competent to deal with\nthem, and several times an angry correspondence had passed between him\nand the governor at Upolu. For he looked upon the natives as his\nchildren. And that was the amazing thing about this coarse, vulgar,\nselfish man; he loved the island on which he had lived so long with\npassion, and he had for the natives a strange rough tenderness which was\nquite wonderful.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe loved to ride about the island on his old grey mare and he was never\ntired of its beauty. Sauntering along the grassy roads among the coconut\ntrees he would stop every now and then to admire the loveliness of the\nscene. Now and then he would come upon a native village and stop while\nthe headman brought him a bowl of kava. He would look at the little\ngroup of bell-shape huts with their high thatched roofs, like beehives,\nand a smile would spread over his fat face. His eyes rested happily on\nthe spreading green of the bread-fruit trees.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By George, it's like the garden of Eden.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSometimes his rides took him along the coast and through the trees he\nhad a glimpse of the wide sea, empty, with never a sail to disturb the\nloneliness; sometimes he climbed a hill so that a great stretch of\ncountry, with little villages nestling among the tall trees, was spread\nout before him like the kingdom of the world, and he would sit there for\nan hour in an ecstasy of delight. But he had no words to express his\nfeelings and to relieve them would utter an obscene jest; it was as\nthough his emotion was so violent that he needed vulgarity to break the\ntension.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh observed this sentiment with an icy disdain. Walker had\nalways been a heavy drinker, he was proud of his capacity to see men\nhalf his age under the table when he spent a night in Apia, and he had\nthe sentimentality of the toper. He could cry over the stories he read\nin his magazines and yet would refuse a loan to some trader in\ndifficulties whom he had known for twenty years. He was close with his\nmoney. Once Mackintosh said to him:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No one could accuse you of giving money away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took it as a compliment. His enthusiasm for nature was but the\ndrivelling sensibility of the drunkard. Nor had Mackintosh any sympathy\nfor his chief's feelings towards the natives. He loved them because they\nwere in his power, as a selfish man loves his dog, and his mentality was\non a level with theirs. Their humour was obscene and he was never at a\nloss for the lewd remark. He understood them and they understood him. He\nwas proud of his influence over them. He looked upon them as his\nchildren and he mixed himself in all their affairs. But he was very\njealous of his authority; if he ruled them with a rod of iron, brooking\nno contradiction, he would not suffer any of the white men on the island\nto take advantage of them. He watched the missionaries suspiciously and,\nif they did anything of which he disapproved, was able to make life so\nunendurable to them that if he could not get them removed they were glad\nto go of their own accord. His power over the natives was so great that\non his word they would refuse labour and food to their pastor. On the\nother hand he showed the traders no favour. He took care that they\nshould not cheat the natives; he saw that they got a fair reward for\ntheir work and their copra and that the traders made no extravagant\nprofit on the wares they sold them. He was merciless to a bargain that\nhe thought unfair. Sometimes the traders would complain at Apia that\nthey did not get fair opportunities. They suffered for it. Walker then\nhesitated at no calumny, at no outrageous lie, to get even with them,\nand they found that if they wanted not only to live at peace, but to\nexist at all, they had to accept the situation on his own terms. More\nthan once the store of a trader obnoxious to him had been burned down,\nand there was only the appositeness of the event to show that the\nadministrator had instigated it. Once a Swedish half-caste, ruined by\nthe burning, had gone to him and roundly accused him of arson. Walker\nlaughed in his face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You dirty dog. Your mother was a native and you try to cheat the\nnatives. If your rotten old store is burned down it's a judgment of\nProvidence; that's what it is, a judgment of Providence. Get out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd as the man was hustled out by two native policemen the administrator\nlaughed fatly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A judgment of Providence.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd now Mackintosh watched him enter upon the day's work. He began with\nthe sick, for Walker added doctoring to his other activities, and he had\na small room behind the office full of drugs. An elderly man came\nforward, a man with a crop of curly grey hair, in a blue lava-lava,\nelaborately tattooed, with the skin of his body wrinkled like a\nwine-skin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What have you come for?\" Walker asked him abruptly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn a whining voice the man said that he could not eat without vomiting\nand that he had pains here and pains there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go to the missionaries,\" said Walker. \"You know that I only cure\nchildren.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have been to the missionaries and they do me no good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then go home and prepare yourself to die. Have you lived so long and\nstill want to go on living? You're a fool.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe man broke into querulous expostulation, but Walker, pointing to a\nwoman with a sick child in her arms, told her to bring it to his desk.\nHe asked her questions and looked at the child.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will give you medicine,\" he said. He turned to the half-caste clerk.\n\"Go into the dispensary and bring me some calomel pills.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe made the child swallow one there and then and gave another to the\nmother.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Take the child away and keep it warm. To-morrow it will be dead or\nbetter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe leaned back in his chair and lit his pipe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wonderful stuff, calomel. I've saved more lives with it than all the\nhospital doctors at Apia put together.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWalker was very proud of his skill, and with the dogmatism of ignorance\nhad no patience with the members of the medical profession.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The sort of case I like,\" he said, \"is the one that all the doctors\nhave given up as hopeless. When the doctors have said they can't cure\nyou, I say to them, 'come to me.' Did I ever tell you about the fellow\nwho had a cancer?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Frequently,\" said Mackintosh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I got him right in three months.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've never told me about the people you haven't cured.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe finished this part of the work and went on to the rest. It was a\nqueer medley. There was a woman who could not get on with her husband\nand a man who complained that his wife had run away from him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Lucky dog,\" said Walker. \"Most men wish their wives would too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a long complicated quarrel about the ownership of a few yards\nof land. There was a dispute about the sharing out of a catch of fish.\nThere was a complaint against a white trader because he had given short\nmeasure. Walker listened attentively to every case, made up his mind\nquickly, and gave his decision. Then he would listen to nothing more; if\nthe complainant went on he was hustled out of the office by a policeman.\nMackintosh listened to it all with sullen irritation. On the whole,\nperhaps, it might be admitted that rough justice was done, but it\nexasperated the assistant that his chief trusted his instinct rather\nthan the evidence. He would not listen to reason. He browbeat the\nwitnesses and when they did not see what he wished them to called them\nthieves and liars.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe left to the last a group of men who were sitting in the corner of the\nroom. He had deliberately ignored them. The party consisted of an old\nchief, a tall, dignified man with short, white hair, in a new lava-lava,\nbearing a huge fly wisp as a badge of office, his son, and half a dozen\nof the important men of the village. Walker had had a feud with them and\nhad beaten them. As was characteristic of him he meant now to rub in his\nvictory, and because he had them down to profit by their helplessness.\nThe facts were peculiar. Walker had a passion for building roads. When\nhe had come to Talua there were but a few tracks here and there, but in\ncourse of time he had cut roads through the country, joining the\nvillages together, and it was to this that a great part of the island's\nprosperity was due. Whereas in the old days it had been impossible to\nget the produce of the land, copra chiefly, down to the coast where it\ncould be put on schooners or motor launches and so taken to Apia, now\ntransport was easy and simple. His ambition was to make a road right\nround the island and a great part of it was already built.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In two years I shall have done it, and then I can die or they can fire\nme, I don't care.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis roads were the joy of his heart and he made excursions constantly to\nsee that they were kept in order. They were simple enough, wide tracks,\ngrass-covered, cut through the scrub or through the plantations; but\ntrees had to be rooted out, rocks dug up or blasted, and here and there\nlevelling had been necessary. He was proud that he had surmounted by his\nown skill such difficulties as they presented. He rejoiced in his\ndisposition of them so that they were not only convenient, but showed\noff the beauties of the island which his soul loved. When he spoke of\nhis roads he was almost a poet. They meandered through those lovely\nscenes, and Walker had taken care that here and there they should run in\na straight line, giving you a green vista through the tall trees, and\nhere and there should turn and curve so that the heart was rested by the\ndiversity. It was amazing that this coarse and sensual man should\nexercise so subtle an ingenuity to get the effects which his fancy\nsuggested to him. He had used in making his roads all the fantastic\nskill of a Japanese gardener. He received a grant from headquarters for\nthe work but took a curious pride in using but a small part of it, and\nthe year before had spent only a hundred pounds of the thousand assigned\nto him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do they want money for?\" he boomed. \"They'll only spend it on all\nkinds of muck they don't want; what the missionaries leave them, that is\nto say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor no particular reason, except perhaps pride in the economy of his\nadministration and the desire to contrast his efficiency with the\nwasteful methods of the authorities at Apia, he got the natives to do\nthe work he wanted for wages that were almost nominal. It was owing to\nthis that he had lately had difficulty with the village whose chief men\nnow were come to see him. The chief's son had been in Upolu for a year\nand on coming back had told his people of the large sums that were paid\nat Apia for the public works. In long, idle talks he had inflamed their\nhearts with the desire for gain. He held out to them visions of vast\nwealth and they thought of the whisky they could buy--it was dear, since\nthere was a law that it must not be sold to natives, and so it cost them\ndouble what the white man had to pay for it--they thought of the great\nsandalwood boxes in which they kept their treasures, and the scented\nsoap and potted salmon, the luxuries for which the Kanaka will sell his\nsoul; so that when the administrator sent for them and told them he\nwanted a road made from their village to a certain point along the coast\nand offered them twenty pounds, they asked him a hundred. The chief's\nson was called Manuma. He was a tall, handsome fellow, copper-coloured,\nwith his fuzzy hair dyed red with lime, a wreath of red berries round\nhis neck, and behind his ear a flower like a scarlet flame against his\nbrown face. The upper part of his body was naked, but to show that he\nwas no longer a savage, since he had lived in Apia, he wore a pair of\ndungarees instead of a lava-lava. He told them that if they held\ntogether the administrator would be obliged to accept their terms. His\nheart was set on building the road and when he found they would not work\nfor less he would give them what they asked. But they must not move;\nwhatever he said they must not abate their claim; they had asked a\nhundred and that they must keep to. When they mentioned the figure,\nWalker burst into a shout of his long, deep-voiced laughter. He told\nthem not to make fools of themselves, but to set about the work at once.\nBecause he was in a good humour that day he promised to give them a\nfeast when the road was finished. But when he found that no attempt was\nmade to start work, he went to the village and asked the men what silly\ngame they were playing. Manuma had coached them well. They were quite\ncalm, they did not attempt to argue--and argument is a passion with the\nKanaka--they merely shrugged their shoulders: they would do it for a\nhundred pounds, and if he would not give them that they would do no\nwork. He could please himself. They did not care. Then Walker flew into\na passion. He was ugly then. His short fat neck swelled ominously, his\nred face grew purple, he foamed at the mouth. He set upon the natives\nwith invective. He knew well how to wound and how to humiliate. He was\nterrifying. The older men grew pale and uneasy. They hesitated. If it\nhad not been for Manuma, with his knowledge of the great world, and\ntheir dread of his ridicule, they would have yielded. It was Manuma who\nanswered Walker.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pay us a hundred pounds and we will work.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWalker, shaking his fist at him, called him every name he could think\nof. He riddled him with scorn. Manuma sat still and smiled. There may\nhave been more bravado than confidence in his smile, but he had to make\na good show before the others. He repeated his words.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pay us a hundred pounds and we will work.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey thought that Walker would spring on him. It would not have been the\nfirst time that he had thrashed a native with his own hands; they knew\nhis strength, and though Walker was three times the age of the young man\nand six inches shorter they did not doubt that he was more than a match\nfor Manuma. No one had ever thought of resisting the savage onslaught of\nthe administrator. But Walker said nothing. He chuckled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am not going to waste my time with a pack of fools,\" he said. \"Talk\nit over again. You know what I have offered. If you do not start in a\nweek, take care.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned round and walked out of the chief's hut. He untied his old\nmare and it was typical of the relations between him and the natives\nthat one of the elder men hung on to the off stirrup while Walker from a\nconvenient boulder hoisted himself heavily into the saddle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat same night when Walker according to his habit was strolling along\nthe road that ran past his house, he heard something whizz past him and\nwith a thud strike a tree. Something had been thrown at him. He ducked\ninstinctively. With a shout, \"Who's that?\" he ran towards the place from\nwhich the missile had come and he heard the sound of a man escaping\nthrough the bush. He knew it was hopeless to pursue in the darkness, and\nbesides he was soon out of breath, so he stopped and made his way back\nto the road. He looked about for what had been thrown, but could find\nnothing. It was quite dark. He went quickly back to the house and called\nMackintosh and the Chinese boy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One of those devils has thrown something at me. Come along and let's\nfind out what it was.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe told the boy to bring a lantern and the three of them made their way\nback to the place. They hunted about the ground, but could not find what\nthey sought. Suddenly the boy gave a guttural cry. They turned to look.\nHe held up the lantern, and there, sinister in the light that cut the\nsurrounding darkness, was a long knife sticking into the trunk of a\ncoconut tree. It had been thrown with such force that it required quite\nan effort to pull it out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By George, if he hadn't missed me I'd have been in a nice state.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWalker handled the knife. It was one of those knives, made in imitation\nof the sailor knives brought to the islands a hundred years before by\nthe first white men, used to divide the coconuts in two so that the\ncopra might be dried. It was a murderous weapon, and the blade, twelve\ninches long, was very sharp. Walker chuckled softly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The devil, the impudent devil.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had no doubt it was Manuma who had flung the knife. He had escaped\ndeath by three inches. He was not angry. On the contrary, he was in high\nspirits; the adventure exhilarated him, and when they got back to the\nhouse, calling for drinks, he rubbed his hands gleefully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll make them pay for this!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis little eyes twinkled. He blew himself out like a turkey-cock, and\nfor the second time within half an hour insisted on telling Mackintosh\nevery detail of the affair. Then he asked him to play piquet, and while\nthey played he boasted of his intentions. Mackintosh listened with\ntightened lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But why should you grind them down like this?\" he asked. \"Twenty pounds\nis precious little for the work you want them to do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They ought to be precious thankful I give them anything.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hang it all, it's not your own money. The government allots you a\nreasonable sum. They won't complain if you spend it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're a bunch of fools at Apia.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh saw that Walker's motive was merely vanity. He shrugged his\nshoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It won't do you much good to score off the fellows at Apia at the cost\nof your life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bless you, they wouldn't hurt me, these people. They couldn't do\nwithout me. They worship me. Manuma is a fool. He only threw that knife\nto frighten me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe next day Walker rode over again to the village. It was called\nMatautu. He did not get off his horse. When he reached the chief's house\nhe saw that the men were sitting round the floor in a circle, talking,\nand he guessed they were discussing again the question of the road. The\nSamoan huts are formed in this way: trunks of slender trees are placed\nin a circle at intervals of perhaps five or six feet; a tall tree is set\nin the middle and from this downwards slopes the thatched roof. Venetian\nblinds of coconut leaves can be pulled down at night or when it is\nraining. Ordinarily the hut is open all round so that the breeze can\nblow through freely. Walker rode to the edge of the hut and called out\nto the chief.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, there, Tangatu, your son left his knife in a tree last night. I\nhave brought it back to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe flung it down on the ground in the midst of the circle, and with a\nlow burst of laughter ambled off.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn Monday he went out to see if they had started work. There was no sign\nof it. He rode through the village. The inhabitants were about their\nordinary avocations. Some were weaving mats of the pandanus leaf, one\nold man was busy with a kava bowl, the children were playing, the women\nwent about their household chores. Walker, a smile on his lips, came to\nthe chief's house.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Talofa-li</i>,\" said the chief.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Talofa</i>,\" answered Walker.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nManuma was making a net. He sat with a cigarette between his lips and\nlooked up at Walker with a smile of triumph.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You have decided that you will not make the road.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe chief answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not unless you pay us one hundred pounds.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You will regret it.\" He turned to Manuma. \"And you, my lad, I shouldn't\nwonder if your back was very sore before you're much older.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe rode away chuckling. He left the natives vaguely uneasy. They feared\nthe fat sinful old man, and neither the missionaries' abuse of him nor\nthe scorn which Manuma had learnt in Apia made them forget that he had a\ndevilish cunning and that no man had ever braved him without in the long\nrun suffering for it. They found out within twenty-four hours what\nscheme he had devised. It was characteristic. For next morning a great\nband of men, women, and children came into the village and the chief men\nsaid that they had made a bargain with Walker to build the road. He had\noffered them twenty pounds and they had accepted. Now the cunning lay in\nthis, that the Polynesians have rules of hospitality which have all the\nforce of laws; an etiquette of absolute rigidity made it necessary for\nthe people of the village not only to give lodging to the strangers, but\nto provide them with food and drink as long as they wished to stay. The\ninhabitants of Matautu were outwitted. Every morning the workers went\nout in a joyous band, cut down trees, blasted rocks, levelled here and\nthere and then in the evening tramped back again, and ate and drank, ate\nheartily, danced, sang hymns, and enjoyed life. For them it was a\npicnic. But soon their hosts began to wear long faces; the strangers had\nenormous appetites, and the plantains and the bread-fruit vanished\nbefore their rapacity; the alligator-pear trees, whose fruit sent to\nApia might sell for good money, were stripped bare. Ruin stared them in\nthe face. And then they found that the strangers were working very\nslowly. Had they received a hint from Walker that they might take their\ntime? At this rate by the time the road was finished there would not be\na scrap of food in the village. And worse than this, they were a\nlaughing-stock; when one or other of them went to some distant hamlet on\nan errand he found that the story had got there before him, and he was\nmet with derisive laughter. There is nothing the Kanaka can endure less\nthan ridicule. It was not long before much angry talk passed among the\nsufferers. Manuma was no longer a hero; he had to put up with a good\ndeal of plain speaking, and one day what Walker had suggested came to\npass: a heated argument turned into a quarrel and half a dozen of the\nyoung men set upon the chief's son and gave him such a beating that for\na week he lay bruised and sore on the pandanus mats. He turned from side\nto side and could find no ease. Every day or two the administrator rode\nover on his old mare and watched the progress of the road. He was not a\nman to resist the temptation of taunting the fallen foe, and he missed\nno opportunity to rub into the shamed inhabitants of Matautu the\nbitterness of their humiliation. He broke their spirit. And one morning,\nputting their pride in their pockets--a figure of speech, since pockets\nthey had not--they all set out with the strangers and started working on\nthe road. It was urgent to get it done quickly if they wanted to save\nany food at all, and the whole village joined in. But they worked\nsilently, with rage and mortification in their hearts, and even the\nchildren toiled in silence. The women wept as they carried away bundles\nof brushwood. When Walker saw them he laughed so much that he almost\nrolled out of his saddle. The news spread quickly and tickled the people\nof the island to death. This was the greatest joke of all, the crowning\ntriumph of that cunning old white man whom no Kanaka had ever been able\nto circumvent; and they came from distant villages, with their wives and\nchildren, to look at the foolish folk who had refused twenty pounds to\nmake the road and now were forced to work for nothing. But the harder\nthey worked the more easily went the guests. Why should they hurry, when\nthey were getting good food for nothing and the longer they took about\nthe job the better the joke became? At last the wretched villagers could\nstand it no longer, and they were come this morning to beg the\nadministrator to send the strangers back to their own homes. If he would\ndo this they promised to finish the road themselves for nothing. For him\nit was a victory complete and unqualified. They were humbled. A look of\narrogant complacence spread over his large, naked face, and he seemed to\nswell in his chair like a great bullfrog. There was something sinister\nin his appearance, so that Mackintosh shivered with disgust. Then in his\nbooming tones he began to speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it for my good that I make the road? What benefit do you think I get\nout of it? It is for you, so that you can walk in comfort and carry your\ncopra in comfort. I offered to pay you for your work, though it was for\nyour own sake the work was done. I offered to pay you generously. Now\n<i>you</i> must pay. I will send the people of Manua back to their homes if\nyou will finish the road and pay the twenty pounds that I have to pay\nthem.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was an outcry. They sought to reason with him. They told him they\nhad not the money. But to everything they said he replied with brutal\ngibes. Then the clock struck.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dinner time,\" he said. \"Turn them all out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe raised himself heavily from his chair and walked out of the room.\nWhen Mackintosh followed him he found him already seated at table, a\nnapkin tied round his neck, holding his knife and fork in readiness for\nthe meal the Chinese cook was about to bring. He was in high spirits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I did 'em down fine,\" he said, as Mackintosh sat down. \"I shan't have\nmuch trouble with the roads after this.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you were joking,\" said Mackintosh icily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not really going to make them pay twenty pounds?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You bet your life I am.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not sure you've got any right to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ain't you? I guess I've got the right to do any damned thing I like on\nthis island.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think you've bullied them quite enough.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWalker laughed fatly. He did not care what Mackintosh thought.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When I want your opinion I'll ask for it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh grew very white. He knew by bitter experience that he could\ndo nothing but keep silence, and the violent effort at self-control made\nhim sick and faint. He could not eat the food that was before him and\nwith disgust he watched Walker shovel meat into his vast mouth. He was a\ndirty feeder, and to sit at table with him needed a strong stomach.\nMackintosh shuddered. A tremendous desire seized him to humiliate that\ngross and cruel man; he would give anything in the world to see him in\nthe dust, suffering as much as he had made others suffer. He had never\nloathed the bully with such loathing as now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe day wore on. Mackintosh tried to sleep after dinner, but the passion\nin his heart prevented him; he tried to read, but the letters swam\nbefore his eyes. The sun beat down pitilessly, and he longed for rain;\nbut he knew that rain would bring no coolness; it would only make it\nhotter and more steamy. He was a native of Aberdeen and his heart\nyearned suddenly for the icy winds that whistled through the granite\nstreets of that city. Here he was a prisoner, imprisoned not only by\nthat placid sea, but by his hatred for that horrible old man. He pressed\nhis hands to his aching head. He would like to kill him. But he pulled\nhimself together. He must do something to distract his mind, and since\nhe could not read he thought he would set his private papers in order.\nIt was a job which he had long meant to do and which he had constantly\nput off. He unlocked the drawer of his desk and took out a handful of\nletters. He caught sight of his revolver. An impulse, no sooner realised\nthan set aside, to put a bullet through his head and so escape from the\nintolerable bondage of life flashed through his mind. He noticed that in\nthe damp air the revolver was slightly rusted, and he got an oil rag and\nbegan to clean it. It was while he was thus occupied that he grew aware\nof someone slinking round the door. He looked up and called:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is there?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a moment's pause, then Manuma showed himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you want?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe chief's son stood for a moment, sullen and silent, and when he spoke\nit was with a strangled voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We can't pay twenty pounds. We haven't the money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What am I to do?\" said Mackintosh. \"You heard what Mr. Walker said.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nManuma began to plead, half in Samoan and half in English. It was a\nsing-song whine, with the quavering intonations of a beggar, and it\nfilled Mackintosh with disgust. It outraged him that the man should let\nhimself be so crushed. He was a pitiful object.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can do nothing,\" said Mackintosh irritably. \"You know that Mr. Walker\nis master here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nManuma was silent again. He still stood in the doorway.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am sick,\" he said at last. \"Give me some medicine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is the matter with you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do not know. I am sick. I have pains in my body.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't stand there,\" said Mackintosh sharply. \"Come in and let me look\nat you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nManuma entered the little room and stood before the desk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have pains here and here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put his hands to his loins and his face assumed an expression of\npain. Suddenly Mackintosh grew conscious that the boy's eyes were\nresting on the revolver which he had laid on the desk when Manuma\nappeared in the doorway. There was a silence between the two which to\nMackintosh was endless. He seemed to read the thoughts which were in the\nKanaka's mind. His heart beat violently. And then he felt as though\nsomething possessed him so that he acted under the compulsion of a\nforeign will. Himself did not make the movements of his body, but a\npower that was strange to him. His throat was suddenly dry, and he put\nhis hand to it mechanically in order to help his speech. He was impelled\nto avoid Manuma's eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Just wait here,\" he said, his voice sounded as though someone had\nseized him by the windpipe, \"and I'll fetch you something from the\ndispensary.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got up. Was it his fancy that he staggered a little? Manuma stood\nsilently, and though he kept his eyes averted, Mackintosh knew that he\nwas looking dully out of the door. It was this other person that\npossessed him that drove him out of the room, but it was himself that\ntook a handful of muddled papers and threw them on the revolver in order\nto hide it from view. He went to the dispensary. He got a pill and\npoured out some blue draught into a small bottle, and then came out into\nthe compound. He did not want to go back into his own bungalow, so he\ncalled to Manuma.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave him the drugs and instructions how to take them. He did not know\nwhat it was that made it impossible for him to look at the Kanaka. While\nhe was speaking to him he kept his eyes on his shoulder. Manuma took the\nmedicine and slunk out of the gate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh went into the dining-room and turned over once more the old\nnewspapers. But he could not read them. The house was very still. Walker\nwas upstairs in his room asleep, the Chinese cook was busy in the\nkitchen, the two policemen were out fishing. The silence that seemed to\nbrood over the house was unearthly, and there hammered in Mackintosh's\nhead the question whether the revolver still lay where he had placed it.\nHe could not bring himself to look. The uncertainty was horrible, but\nthe certainty would be more horrible still. He sweated. At last he could\nstand the silence no longer, and he made up his mind to go down the road\nto the trader's, a man named Jervis, who had a store about a mile away.\nHe was a half-caste, but even that amount of white blood made him\npossible to talk to. He wanted to get away from his bungalow, with the\ndesk littered with untidy papers, and underneath them something, or\nnothing. He walked along the road. As he passed the fine hut of a chief\na greeting was called out to him. Then he came to the store. Behind the\ncounter sat the trader's daughter, a swarthy broad-featured girl in a\npink blouse and a white drill skirt. Jervis hoped he would marry her. He\nhad money, and he had told Mackintosh that his daughter's husband would\nbe well-to-do. She flushed a little when she saw Mackintosh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Father's just unpacking some cases that have come in this morning. I'll\ntell him you're here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sat down and the girl went out behind the shop. In a moment her\nmother waddled in, a huge old woman, a chiefess, who owned much land in\nher own right; and gave him her hand. Her monstrous obesity was an\noffence, but she managed to convey an impression of dignity. She was\ncordial without obsequiousness; affable, but conscious of her station.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're quite a stranger, Mr. Mackintosh. Teresa was saying only this\nmorning: 'Why, we never see Mr. Mackintosh now.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe shuddered a little as he thought of himself as that old native's\nson-in-law. It was notorious that she ruled her husband, notwithstanding\nhis white blood, with a firm hand. Hers was the authority and hers the\nbusiness head. She might be no more than Mrs. Jervis to the white\npeople, but her father had been a chief of the blood royal, and his\nfather and his father's father had ruled as kings. The trader came in,\nsmall beside his imposing wife, a dark man with a black beard going\ngrey, in ducks, with handsome eyes and flashing teeth. He was very\nBritish, and his conversation was slangy, but you felt he spoke English\nas a foreign tongue; with his family he used the language of his native\nmother. He was a servile man, cringing and obsequious.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, Mr. Mackintosh, this is a joyful surprise. Get the whisky, Teresa;\nMr. Mackintosh will have a gargle with us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave all the latest news of Apia, watching his guest's eyes the\nwhile, so that he might know the welcome thing to say.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And how is Walker? We've not seen him just lately. Mrs. Jervis is going\nto send him a sucking-pig one day this week.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I saw him riding home this morning,\" said Teresa.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Here's how,\" said Jervis, holding up his whisky.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh drank. The two women sat and looked at him, Mrs. Jervis in\nher black Mother Hubbard, placid and haughty, and Teresa anxious to\nsmile whenever she caught his eye, while the trader gossiped\ninsufferably.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They were saying in Apia it was about time Walker retired. He ain't so\nyoung as he was. Things have changed since he first come to the islands\nand he ain't changed with them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He'll go too far,\" said the old chiefess. \"The natives aren't\nsatisfied.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That was a good joke about the road,\" laughed the trader. \"When I told\nthem about it in Apia they fair split their sides with laughing. Good\nold Walker.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh looked at him savagely. What did he mean by talking of him in\nthat fashion? To a half-caste trader he was Mr. Walker. It was on his\ntongue to utter a harsh rebuke for the impertinence. He did not know\nwhat held him back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When he goes I hope you'll take his place, Mr. Mackintosh,\" said\nJervis. \"We all like you on the island. You understand the natives.\nThey're educated now, they must be treated differently to the old days.\nIt wants an educated man to be administrator now. Walker was only a\ntrader same as I am.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTeresa's eyes glistened.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When the time comes if there's anything anyone can do here, you bet\nyour bottom dollar we'll do it. I'd get all the chiefs to go over to\nApia and make a petition.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh felt horribly sick. It had not struck him that if anything\nhappened to Walker it might be he who would succeed him. It was true\nthat no one in his official position knew the island so well. He got up\nsuddenly and scarcely taking his leave walked back to the compound. And\nnow he went straight to his room. He took a quick look at his desk. He\nrummaged among the papers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe revolver was not there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis heart thumped violently against his ribs. He looked for the revolver\neverywhere. He hunted in the chairs and in the drawers. He looked\ndesperately, and all the time he knew he would not find it. Suddenly he\nheard Walker's gruff, hearty voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the devil are you up to, Mac?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe started. Walker was standing in the doorway and instinctively he\nturned round to hide what lay upon his desk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tidying up?\" quizzed Walker. \"I've told 'em to put the grey in the\ntrap. I'm going down to Tafoni to bathe. You'd better come along.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right,\" said Mackintosh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo long as he was with Walker nothing could happen. The place they were\nbound for was about three miles away, and there was a fresh-water pool,\nseparated by a thin barrier of rock from the sea, which the\nadministrator had blasted out for the natives to bathe in. He had done\nthis at spots round the island, wherever there was a spring; and the\nfresh water, compared with the sticky warmth of the sea, was cool and\ninvigorating. They drove along the silent grassy road, splashing now and\nthen through fords, where the sea had forced its way in, past a couple\nof native villages, the bell-shaped huts spaced out roomily and the\nwhite chapel in the middle, and at the third village they got out of the\ntrap, tied up the horse, and walked down to the pool. They were\naccompanied by four or five girls and a dozen children. Soon they were\nall splashing about, shouting and laughing, while Walker, in a\nlava-lava, swam to and fro like an unwieldy porpoise. He made lewd jokes\nwith the girls, and they amused themselves by diving under him and\nwriggling away when he tried to catch them. When he was tired he lay\ndown on a rock, while the girls and children surrounded him; it was a\nhappy family; and the old man, huge, with his crescent of white hair and\nhis shining bald crown, looked like some old sea god. Once Mackintosh\ncaught a queer soft look in his eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're dear children,\" he said. \"They look upon me as their father.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd then without a pause he turned to one of the girls and made an\nobscene remark which sent them all into fits of laughter. Mackintosh\nstarted to dress. With his thin legs and thin arms he made a grotesque\nfigure, a sinister Don Quixote, and Walker began to make coarse jokes\nabout him. They were acknowledged with little smothered laughs.\nMackintosh struggled with his shirt. He knew he looked absurd, but he\nhated being laughed at. He stood silent and glowering.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you want to get back in time for dinner you ought to come soon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not a bad fellow, Mac. Only you're a fool. When you're doing one\nthing you always want to do another. That's not the way we live.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut all the same he raised himself slowly to his feet and began to put\non his clothes. They sauntered back to the village, drank a bowl of kava\nwith the chief, and then, after a joyful farewell from all the lazy\nvillagers, drove home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter dinner, according to his habit, Walker, lighting his cigar,\nprepared to go for a stroll. Mackintosh was suddenly seized with fear.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you think it's rather unwise to go out at night by yourself just\nnow?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWalker stared at him with his round blue eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the devil do you mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Remember the knife the other night. You've got those fellows' backs\nup.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pooh! They wouldn't dare.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Someone dared before.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That was only a bluff. They wouldn't hurt me. They look upon me as a\nfather. They know that whatever I do is for their own good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh watched him with contempt in his heart. The man's\nself-complacency outraged him, and yet something, he knew not what, made\nhim insist.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Remember what happened this morning. It wouldn't hurt you to stay at\nhome just to-night. I'll play piquet with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll play piquet with you when I come back. The Kanaka isn't born yet\nwho can make me alter my plans.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd better let me come with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You stay where you are.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh shrugged his shoulders. He had given the man full warning. If\nhe did not heed it that was his own lookout. Walker put on his hat and\nwent out. Mackintosh began to read; but then he thought of something;\nperhaps it would be as well to have his own whereabouts quite clear. He\ncrossed over to the kitchen and, inventing some pretext, talked for a\nfew minutes with the cook. Then he got out the gramophone and put a\nrecord on it, but while it ground out its melancholy tune, some comic\nsong of a London music-hall, his ear was strained for a sound away there\nin the night. At his elbow the record reeled out its loudness, the words\nwere raucous, but notwithstanding he seemed to be surrounded by an\nunearthly silence. He heard the dull roar of the breakers against the\nreef. He heard the breeze sigh, far up, in the leaves of the coconut\ntrees. How long would it be? It was awful.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe heard a hoarse laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wonders will never cease. It's not often you play yourself a tune,\nMac.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWalker stood at the window, red-faced, bluff and jovial.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you see I'm alive and kicking. What were you playing for?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWalker came in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nerves a bit dicky, eh? Playing a tune to keep your pecker up?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was playing your requiem.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the devil's that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Alf o' bitter an' a pint of stout.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A rattling good song too. I don't mind how often I hear it. Now I'm\nready to take your money off you at piquet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey played and Walker bullied his way to victory, bluffing his\nopponent, chaffing him, jeering at his mistakes, up to every dodge,\nbrowbeating him, exulting. Presently Mackintosh recovered his coolness,\nand standing outside himself, as it were, he was able to take a detached\npleasure in watching the overbearing old man and in his own cold\nreserve. Somewhere Manuma sat quietly and awaited his opportunity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWalker won game after game and pocketed his winnings at the end of the\nevening in high good-humour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll have to grow a little bit older before you stand much chance\nagainst me, Mac. The fact is I have a natural gift for cards.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know that there's much gift about it when I happen to deal you\nfourteen aces.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good cards come to good players,\" retorted Walker. \"I'd have won if I'd\nhad your hands.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went on to tell long stories of the various occasions on which he had\nplayed cards with notorious sharpers and to their consternation had\ntaken all their money from them. He boasted. He praised himself. And\nMackintosh listened with absorption. He wanted now to feed his hatred;\nand everything Walker said, every gesture, made him more detestable. At\nlast Walker got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'm going to turn in,\" he said with a loud yawn, \"I've got a long\nday to-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm driving over to the other side of the island. I'll start at five,\nbut I don't expect I shall get back to dinner till late.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey generally dined at seven.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'd better make it half-past seven then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess it would be as well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh watched him knock the ashes out of his pipe. His vitality was\nrude and exuberant. It was strange to think that death hung over him. A\nfaint smile flickered in Mackintosh's cold, gloomy eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would you like me to come with you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What in God's name should I want that for? I'm using the mare and\nshe'll have enough to do to carry me; she don't want to drag you over\nthirty miles of road.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps you don't quite realise what the feeling is at Matautu. I think\nit would be safer if I came with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWalker burst into contemptuous laughter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd be a fine lot of use in a scrap. I'm not a great hand at getting\nthe wind up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow the smile passed from Mackintosh's eyes to his lips. It distorted\nthem painfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Quem deus vult perdere prius dementat.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the hell is that?\" said Walker.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Latin,\" answered Mackintosh as he went out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd now he chuckled. His mood had changed. He had done all he could and\nthe matter was in the hands of fate. He slept more soundly than he had\ndone for weeks. When he awoke next morning he went out. After a good\nnight he found a pleasant exhilaration in the freshness of the early\nair. The sea was a more vivid blue, the sky more brilliant, than on most\ndays, the trade wind was fresh, and there was a ripple on the lagoon as\nthe breeze brushed over it like velvet brushed the wrong way. He felt\nhimself stronger and younger. He entered upon the day's work with zest.\nAfter luncheon he slept again, and as evening drew on he had the bay\nsaddled and sauntered through the bush. He seemed to see it all with new\neyes. He felt more normal. The extraordinary thing was that he was able\nto put Walker out of his mind altogether. So far as he was concerned he\nmight never have existed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe returned late, hot after his ride, and bathed again. Then he sat on\nthe verandah, smoking his pipe, and looked at the day declining over the\nlagoon. In the sunset the lagoon, rosy and purple and green, was very\nbeautiful. He felt at peace with the world and with himself. When the\ncook came out to say that dinner was ready and to ask whether he should\nwait, Mackintosh smiled at him with friendly eyes. He looked at his\nwatch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's half-past seven. Better not wait. One can't tell when the boss'll\nbe back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe boy nodded, and in a moment Mackintosh saw him carry across the yard\na bowl of steaming soup. He got up lazily, went into the dining-room,\nand ate his dinner. Had it happened? The uncertainty was amusing and\nMackintosh chuckled in the silence. The food did not seem so monotonous\nas usual, and even though there was Hamburger steak, the cook's\ninvariable dish when his poor invention failed him, it tasted by some\nmiracle succulent and spiced. After dinner he strolled over lazily to\nhis bungalow to get a book. He liked the intense stillness, and now that\nthe night had fallen the stars were blazing in the sky. He shouted for a\nlamp and in a moment the Chink pattered over on his bare feet, piercing\nthe darkness with a ray of light. He put the lamp on the desk and\nnoiselessly slipped out of the room. Mackintosh stood rooted to the\nfloor, for there, half hidden by untidy papers, was his revolver. His\nheart throbbed painfully, and he broke into a sweat. It was done then.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took up the revolver with a shaking hand. Four of the chambers were\nempty. He paused a moment and looked suspiciously out into the night,\nbut there was no one there. He quickly slipped four cartridges into the\nempty chambers and locked the revolver in his drawer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sat down to wait.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAn hour passed, a second hour passed. There was nothing. He sat at his\ndesk as though he were writing, but he neither wrote nor read. He merely\nlistened. He strained his ears for a sound travelling from a far\ndistance. At last he heard hesitating footsteps and knew it was the\nChinese cook.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah-Sung,\" he called.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe boy came to the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Boss velly late,\" he said. \"Dinner no good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh stared at him, wondering whether he knew what had happened,\nand whether, when he knew, he would realise on what terms he and Walker\nhad been. He went about his work, sleek, silent, and smiling, and who\ncould tell his thoughts?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I expect he's had dinner on the way, but you must keep the soup hot at\nall events.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when the silence was suddenly\nbroken into by a confusion, cries, and a rapid patter of naked feet. A\nnumber of natives ran into the compound, men and women and children;\nthey crowded round Mackintosh and they all talked at once. They were\nunintelligible. They were excited and frightened and some of them were\ncrying. Mackintosh pushed his way through them and went to the gateway.\nThough he had scarcely understood what they said he knew quite well what\nhad happened. And as he reached the gate the dog-cart arrived. The old\nmare was being led by a tall Kanaka, and in the dog-cart crouched two\nmen, trying to hold Walker up. A little crowd of natives surrounded it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe mare was led into the yard and the natives surged in after it.\nMackintosh shouted to them to stand back and the two policemen,\nappearing suddenly from God knows where, pushed them violently aside. By\nnow he had managed to understand that some lads, who had been fishing,\non their way back to their village had come across the cart on the home\nside of the ford. The mare was nuzzling about the herbage and in the\ndarkness they could just see the great white bulk of the old man sunk\nbetween the seat and the dashboard. At first they thought he was drunk\nand they peered in, grinning, but then they heard him groan, and guessed\nthat something was amiss. They ran to the village and called for help.\nIt was when they returned, accompanied by half a hundred people, that\nthey discovered Walker had been shot.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith a sudden thrill of horror Mackintosh asked himself whether he was\nalready dead. The first thing at all events was to get him out of the\ncart, and that, owing to Walker's corpulence, was a difficult job. It\ntook four strong men to lift him. They jolted him and he uttered a dull\ngroan. He was still alive. At last they carried him into the house, up\nthe stairs, and placed him on his bed. Then Mackintosh was able to see\nhim, for in the yard, lit only by half a dozen hurricane lamps,\neverything had been obscured. Walker's white ducks were stained with\nblood, and the men who had carried him wiped their hands, red and\nsticky, on their lava-lavas. Mackintosh held up the lamp. He had not\nexpected the old man to be so pale. His eyes were closed. He was\nbreathing still, his pulse could be just felt, but it was obvious that\nhe was dying. Mackintosh had not bargained for the shock of horror that\nconvulsed him. He saw that the native clerk was there, and in a voice\nhoarse with fear told him to go into the dispensary and get what was\nnecessary for a hypodermic injection. One of the policemen had brought\nup the whisky, and Mackintosh forced a little into the old man's mouth.\nThe room was crowded with natives. They sat about the floor, speechless\nnow and terrified, and every now and then one wailed aloud. It was very\nhot, but Mackintosh felt cold, his hands and his feet were like ice, and\nhe had to make a violent effort not to tremble in all his limbs. He did\nnot know what to do. He did not know if Walker was bleeding still, and\nif he was, how he could stop the bleeding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe clerk brought the hypodermic needle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You give it to him,\" said Mackintosh. \"You're more used to that sort of\nthing than I am.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis head ached horribly. It felt as though all sorts of little savage\nthings were beating inside it, trying to get out. They watched for the\neffect of the injection. Presently Walker opened his eyes slowly. He did\nnot seem to know where he was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Keep quiet,\" said Mackintosh. \"You're at home. You're quite safe.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWalker's lips outlined a shadowy smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They've got me,\" he whispered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll get Jervis to send his motor-boat to Apia at once. We'll get a\ndoctor out by to-morrow afternoon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a long pause before the old man answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall be dead by then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA ghastly expression passed over Mackintosh's pale face. He forced\nhimself to laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What rot! You keep quiet and you'll be as right as rain.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give me a drink,\" said Walker. \"A stiff one.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith shaking hand Mackintosh poured out whisky and water, half and half,\nand held the glass while Walker drank greedily. It seemed to restore\nhim. He gave a long sigh and a little colour came into his great fleshy\nface. Mackintosh felt extraordinarily helpless. He stood and stared at\nthe old man.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you'll tell me what to do I'll do it,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's nothing to do. Just leave me alone. I'm done for.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked dreadfully pitiful as he lay on the great bed, a huge,\nbloated, old man; but so wan, so weak, it was heart-rending. As he\nrested, his mind seemed to grow clearer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You were right, Mac,\" he said presently. \"You warned me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish to God I'd come with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're a good chap, Mac, only you don't drink.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was another long silence, and it was clear that Walker was\nsinking. There was an internal hæmorrhage and even Mackintosh in his\nignorance could not fail to see that his chief had but an hour or two to\nlive. He stood by the side of the bed stock-still. For half an hour\nperhaps Walker lay with his eyes closed, then he opened them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They'll give you my job,\" he said, slowly. \"Last time I was in Apia I\ntold them you were all right. Finish my road. I want to think that'll be\ndone. All round the island.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want your job. You'll get all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWalker shook his head wearily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've had my day. Treat them fairly, that's the great thing. They're\nchildren. You must always remember that. You must be firm with them, but\nyou must be kind. And you must be just. I've never made a bob out of\nthem. I haven't saved a hundred pounds in twenty years. The road's the\ngreat thing. Get the road finished.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSomething very like a sob was wrung from Mackintosh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're a good fellow, Mac. I always liked you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe closed his eyes, and Mackintosh thought that he would never open them\nagain. His mouth was so dry that he had to get himself something to\ndrink. The Chinese cook silently put a chair for him. He sat down by the\nside of the bed and waited. He did not know how long a time passed. The\nnight was endless. Suddenly one of the men sitting there broke into\nuncontrollable sobbing, loudly, like a child, and Mackintosh grew aware\nthat the room was crowded by this time with natives. They sat all over\nthe floor on their haunches, men and women, staring at the bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are all these people doing here?\" said Mackintosh. \"They've got no\nright. Turn them out, turn them out, all of them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis words seemed to rouse Walker, for he opened his eyes once more, and\nnow they were all misty. He wanted to speak, but he was so weak that\nMackintosh had to strain his ears to catch what he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let them stay. They're my children. They ought to be here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh turned to the natives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Stay where you are. He wants you. But be silent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA faint smile came over the old man's white face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come nearer,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh bent over him. His eyes were closed and the words he said\nwere like a wind sighing through the fronds of the coconut trees.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give me another drink. I've got something to say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis time Mackintosh gave him his whisky neat. Walker collected his\nstrength in a final effort of will.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't make a fuss about this. In 'ninety-five when there were troubles\nwhite men were killed, and the fleet came and shelled the villages. A\nlot of people were killed who'd had nothing to do with it. They're\ndamned fools at Apia. If they make a fuss they'll only punish the wrong\npeople. I don't want anyone punished.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe paused for a while to rest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must say it was an accident. No one's to blame. Promise me that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll do anything you like,\" whispered Mackintosh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good chap. One of the best. They're children. I'm their father. A\nfather don't let his children get into trouble if he can help it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA ghost of a chuckle came out of his throat. It was astonishingly weird\nand ghastly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're a religious chap, Mac. What's that about forgiving them! You\nknow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a while Mackintosh did not answer. His lips trembled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Forgive them, for they know not what they do?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's right. Forgive them. I've loved them, you know, always loved\nthem.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sighed. His lips faintly moved, and now Mackintosh had to put his\nears quite close to them in order to hear.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hold my hand,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh gave a gasp. His heart seemed wrenched. He took the old man's\nhand, so cold and weak, a coarse, rough hand, and held it in his own.\nAnd thus he sat until he nearly started out of his seat, for the silence\nwas suddenly broken by a long rattle. It was terrible and unearthly.\nWalker was dead. Then the natives broke out with loud cries. The tears\nran down their faces, and they beat their breasts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMackintosh disengaged his hand from the dead man's and staggering like\none drunk with sleep he went out of the room. He went to the locked\ndrawer in his writing-desk and took out the revolver. He walked down to\nthe sea and walked into the lagoon; he waded out cautiously, so that he\nshould not trip against a coral rock, till the water came to his\narm-pits. Then he put a bullet through his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAn hour later half a dozen slim brown sharks were splashing and\nstruggling at the spot where he fell.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI do not vouch for the truth of this story, but it was told me by a\nprofessor of French literature at an English university, and he was a\nman of too high a character, I think, to have told it to me unless it\nwere true. His practice was to draw the attention of his students to\nthree French writers who in his opinion combined the qualities that are\nthe mainsprings of the French character. By reading them, he said, you\ncould learn so much about the French people that, if he had the power,\nhe would not trust such of our rulers as have to deal with the French\nnation to enter upon their offices till they had passed a pretty stiff\nexamination on their works. They are Rabelais, with his <i>gauloiserie</i>,\nwhich may be described as the ribaldry that likes to call a spade\nsomething more than a bloody shovel; La Fontaine, with his <i>bon sens</i>,\nwhich is just horse sense; and finally Corneille, with his <i>panache</i>.\nThis is translated in the dictionaries as the plume, the plume the\nknight at arms wore on his helmet, but metaphorically it seems to\nsignify dignity and bravado, display and heroism, vainglory and pride.\nIt was <i>le panache</i> that made the French gentlemen at Fontenoy say to\nthe officers of King George II, fire first, gentlemen; it was <i>le\npanache</i> that wrung from Cambronne's bawdy lips at Waterloo the phrase:\nthe guard dies but never surrenders; and it is <i>le panache</i> that urges\nan indigent French poet, awarded the Nobel prize, with a splendid\ngesture to give it all away. My professor was not a frivolous man and to\nhis mind the story I am about to tell brought out so distinctly the\nthree master qualities of the French that it had a high educational\nvalue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI have called it Appearance and Reality. This is the title of what I\nsuppose may be looked upon as the most important philosophical work that\nmy country (right or wrong) produced in the nineteenth century. It is\nstiff, but stimulating reading. It is written in excellent English, with\nconsiderable humour, and even though the lay reader is unlikely to\nfollow with understanding some of its very subtle arguments he has\nnevertheless the thrilling sensation of walking a spiritual tight-rope\nover a metaphysical abyss, and he ends the book with a comfortable\nfeeling that nothing matters a hang anyway. There is no excuse for my\nmaking use of the title of so celebrated a book except that it so\nadmirably suits my story. Though Lisette was a philosopher only in the\nsense in which we are all philosophers, that she exercised thought in\ndealing with the problems of existence, her feeling for reality was so\nstrong and her sympathy for appearance so genuine that she might almost\nclaim to have established that reconciliation of irreconcilables at\nwhich the philosophers have for so many centuries been aiming. Lisette\nwas French, and she passed several hours of every working day dressing\nand undressing herself at one of the most expensive and fashionable\nestablishments in Paris. A pleasant occupation for a young woman who was\nwell aware that she had a lovely figure. She was in short a mannequin.\nShe was tall enough to be able to wear a train with elegance and her\nhips were so slim that in sports clothes she could bring the scent of\nheather to your nostrils. Her long legs enabled her to wear pyjamas with\ndistinction, and her slim waist, her little breasts, made the simplest\nbathing-dress a ravishment. She could wear anything. She had a way of\nhuddling herself in a chinchilla coat that made the most sensible\npersons admit that chinchilla was worth all the money it cost. Fat\nwomen, gross women, stumpy women, bony women, shapeless women, old\nwomen, plain women, sat in the spacious arm-chairs and because Lisette\nlooked so sweet bought the clothes that so admirably suited her. She had\nlarge brown eyes, a large red mouth and a very clear but slightly\nfreckled skin. It was difficult for her to preserve that haughty, sullen\nand coldly indifferent demeanour that appears to be essential to the\nmannequin as she sails in with deliberate steps, turns round slowly and,\nwith an air of contempt for the universe equalled only by the camel's,\nsails out. There was the suspicion of a twinkle in Lisette's large brown\neyes and her red lips seemed to tremble as though on the smallest\nprovocation they would break into a smile. It was the twinkle that\nattracted the attention of Monsieur Raymond Le Sueur.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was sitting in a spurious Louis XVI chair by the side of his wife (in\nanother) who had induced him to come with her to see the private view of\nthe spring fashions. This was a proof of Monsieur Le Sueur's amiable\ndisposition, for he was an extremely busy man who, one would have\nthought, had many more important things to do than to sit for an hour\nand watch a dozen beautiful young women parade themselves in a\nbewildering variety of costumes. He could not have thought that any of\nthem could possibly make his wife other than she was, and she was a\ntall, angular woman of fifty, with features considerably larger than\nlife-size. He had not indeed married her for her looks, and she had\nnever, even in the first delirious days of their honeymoon, imagined\nthat he had. He had married her in order to combine the flourishing\nsteel works of which she was the heiress with his equally flourishing\nmanufactory of locomotives. The marriage had been a success. She had\nprovided him with a son who could play tennis nearly as well as a\nprofessional, dance quite as well as a gigolo, and hold his own at\nbridge with any of the experts; and a daughter whom he had been able to\ndower sufficiently to marry to a very nearly authentic prince. He had\nreason to be proud of his children. By perseverance and a reasonable\nintegrity he had prospered sufficiently to gain the controlling interest\nin a sugar refinery, a movie company, a firm that built motor-cars and a\nnewspaper; and finally he had been able to spend enough money to\npersuade the free and independent electorate of a certain district to\nsend him to the Senate. He was a man of a dignified presence, a pleasing\ncorpulence and a sanguine complexion, with a neat grey beard cut square,\na bald head and a roll of fat at the back of his neck. You had no need\nto look at the red button that adorned his black coat to surmise that he\nwas a person of consequence. He was a man who made up his mind quickly\nand when his wife left the dressmaker's to go and play bridge he parted\nfrom her, saying that for the sake of exercise he would walk to the\nSenate, where his duty to his country called him. He did not however go\nas far as this, but contented himself with taking his exercise up and\ndown a back street into which he rightly surmised the young ladies of\nthe dressmaker's establishment would emerge at the close of business\nhours. He had barely waited for a quarter of an hour when the appearance\nof a number of women in groups, some young and pretty, some not so young\nand far from pretty, apprised him that the moment for which he had been\nwaiting was come, and in two or three minutes Lisette tripped into the\nstreet. The Senator was well aware that his appearance and his age made\nit unlikely that young women would find him attractive at first sight,\nbut he had found that his wealth and his position counterbalanced these\ndisadvantages. Lisette had a companion with her, which would possibly\nhave embarrassed a man of less importance, but did not cause the Senator\nto hesitate for an instant; he went up to her, raising his hat politely\nbut not so much as to show how bald he was, and bade her good evening.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Bon soir, Mademoiselle</i>,\" he said with an ingratiating smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him the shortest possible look and, her full red lips just\ntrembling with a smile, stiffened; she turned her head away and breaking\ninto conversation with her friend, walked on with a very good assumption\nof supreme indifference. Far from disconcerted, the Senator turned round\nand followed the two girls at a distance of a few yards. They walked\nalong the little back street, turned into the boulevard and at the Place\nde la Madeleine took a bus. The Senator was well satisfied. He had drawn\na number of correct conclusions. The fact that she was obviously going\nhome with a girl friend proved that she had no accredited admirer. The\nfact that she had turned away when he had accosted her showed that she\nwas discreet and modest and well behaved, which he liked young women to\nbe when they were pretty; and her coat and skirt, the plain black hat\nand the rayon stockings proclaimed that she was poor and therefore\nvirtuous. In those clothes she looked just as attractive as in the\nsplendid garments he had seen her wearing before. He had a funny little\nfeeling in his heart. He had not had that peculiar sensation,\npleasurable and yet oddly painful, for several years, but he recognised\nit at once.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's love, by blue,\" he muttered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had never expected to feel it again, and squaring his shoulders he\nwalked on with a confident step. He walked to the offices of a private\ndetective and there left instructions that inquiries should be made\nabout a young person called Lisette, who worked as a mannequin at such\nand such an address; and then, remembering that at the Senate they were\ndiscussing the American Debt, took a cab to the impressive building,\nentered the library, where there was an arm-chair he very much liked,\nand had a pleasant nap. The information he had asked for reached him\nthree days later. It was cheap at the price. Mademoiselle Lisette Larion\nlived with a widowed aunt in a two-room apartment in the district of\nParis known as the Batignolles. Her father, a wounded hero of the great\nwar, had a <i>bureau de tabac</i> in a small country town in the southwest of\nFrance. The rent of the flat was two thousand francs. She led a regular\nlife, but was fond of going to the pictures, was not known to have a\nlover, and was nineteen years old. She was well spoken of by the\nconcierge of the apartments and well liked by her companions at the\nshop. Obviously she was a very respectable young woman and the Senator\ncould not but think that she was eminently suited to solace the leisure\nmoments of a man who wanted relaxation from the cares of state and the\nexacting pressure of Big Business.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt is unnecessary to relate in detail the steps that Monsieur Le Sueur\ntook to achieve the end he had in view. He was too important and too\nbusy to occupy himself with the matter personally, but he had a\nconfidential secretary who was very clever at dealing with electors who\nhad not made up their minds how to vote, and who certainly knew how to\nput before a young woman who was honest but poor the advantages that\nmight ensue if she were lucky enough to secure the friendship of such a\nman as his employer. The confidential secretary paid the widowed aunt,\nMadame Saladin by name, a visit and told her that Monsieur Le Sueur,\nalways abreast of the time, had lately begun to take an interest in\nfilms and was indeed about to engage in the production of a picture.\n(This shows how much a clever brain can make use of a fact that an\nordinary person would have passed over as insignificant.) Monsieur Le\nSueur had been struck by the appearance of Mademoiselle Lisette at the\ndressmaker's and the brilliant way she wore her clothes, and it had\noccurred to him that she might very well suit a part he had it in mind\nfor her to play. (Like all intelligent people the Senator always stuck\nas close to the truth as he could.) The confidential secretary then\ninvited Madame Saladin and her niece to a dinner where they could make\none another's further acquaintance and the Senator could judge whether\nMademoiselle Lisette had the aptitude for the screen that he suspected.\nMadame Saladin said she would ask her niece, but for her part seemed to\nthink the suggestion quite reasonable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Madame Saladin put the proposition before Lisette and explained the\nrank, dignity and importance of their generous host, that young person\nshrugged her pretty shoulders disdainfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Cette vieille carpe</i>,\" she said, of which the not quite literal\ntranslation is: that old trout.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does it matter if he's an old trout if he gives you a part?\" said\nMadame Saladin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Et ta soeur</i>,\" said Lisette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis phrase, which of course means: and your sister, and sounds harmless\nenough, and even pointless, is a trifle vulgar and is used by\nwell-brought-up young women, I think, only if they want to shock. It\nexpresses the most forcible unbelief, and the only correct translation\ninto the vernacular is too coarse for my chaste pen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Anyhow we should get a slap-up dinner,\" said Madame Saladin. \"After\nall, you're not a child any more.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where did he say we should dine?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Château de Madrid. Everyone knows it's the most expensive\nrestaurant in the world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere is no reason why it should not be. The food is very good, the\ncellar is famous, and its situation makes it on a fine evening of early\nsummer an enchanting place to eat at. A very pretty dimple appeared on\nLisette's cheek and a smile on her large red mouth. She had perfect\nteeth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can borrow a dress from the shop,\" she murmured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA few days later the Senator's confidential secretary fetched them in a\ntaxi and drove Madame Saladin and her engaging niece to the Bois de\nBoulogne. Lisette looked ravishing in one of the firm's most successful\nmodels and Madame Saladin extremely respectable in her own black satin\nand a hat that Lisette had made for the occasion. The secretary\nintroduced the ladies to Monsieur Le Sueur, who greeted them with the\nbenign dignity of the politician who is behaving graciously to the wife\nand daughter of a valued constituent; and this is exactly what he in his\nastute way he thought people at adjacent tables who knew him would\nimagine his guests to be. The dinner passed off very agreeably, and less\nthan a month later Lisette moved into a charming little flat at a\nconvenient distance both from her place of business and from the Senate.\nIt was decorated in the modern style by a fashionable upholsterer.\nMonsieur Le Sueur wished Lisette to continue to work. It suited him very\nwell that she should have something to do during the hours that he was\nobliged to devote to affairs, for it would keep her out of mischief, and\nhe very well knew that a woman who has nothing to do all day spends much\nmore money than one who has an occupation. An intelligent man thinks of\nthese things.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut extravagance was a vice to which Lisette was strange. The Senator\nwas fond and generous. It was a source of satisfaction to him that\nLisette began very soon to save money. She ran her apartment with thrift\nand bought her clothes at trade prices, and every month sent a certain\nsum home to her heroic father, who purchased little plots of land with\nit. She continued to lead a quiet and modest life and Monsieur Le Sueur\nwas pleased to learn from the concierge, who had a son she wanted to\nplace in a government office, that Lisette's only visitors were her aunt\nand one or two girls from the shop.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Senator had never been happier in his life. It was very satisfactory\nto him to think that even in this world a good action had its reward,\nfor was it not from pure kindness that he had accompanied his wife to\nthe dressmaker's on that afternoon when they were discussing the\nAmerican Debt at the Senate and thus seen for the first time the\ncharming Lisette? The more he knew her the more he doted on her. She was\na delightful companion. She was gay and debonair. Her intelligence was\nrespectable and she could listen cleverly when he discussed business\nmatters or affairs of state with her. She rested him when he was weary\nand cheered him when he was depressed. She was glad to see him when he\ncame, and he came frequently, generally from five till seven, and sorry\nwhen he went away. She gave him the impression that he was not only her\nlover but her friend. Sometimes they dined together in her apartment,\nand the well-appointed meal, the genial comfort, gave him a keen\nappreciation of the charm of domesticity. His friends told the Senator\nhe looked twenty years younger. He felt it. He was conscious of his good\nfortune. He could not but feel, however, that after a life of honest\ntoil and public service it was only his due.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was thus a shock to him, after things had been proceeding so happily\nfor nearly two years, on coming back to Paris early one Sunday morning\nunexpectedly after a visit to his constituency which was to last over\nthe week-end, when he let himself into the apartment with his latchkey,\nthinking since it was the day of rest to find Lisette in bed, to\ndiscover her having breakfast in her bedroom <i>tête-à-tête</i> with a young\ngentleman he had never seen before who was wearing his (the Senator's)\nbrand new pyjamas. Lisette was surprised to see him. Indeed she gave a\ndistinct start.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Tiens</i>,\" she said. \"Where have you sprung from? I didn't expect you\ntill to-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Ministry has fallen,\" he answered mechanically. \"I have been sent\nfor. I am to be offered the Ministry of the Interior.\" But that was not\nwhat he wanted to say at all. He gave the gentleman who was wearing his\npyjamas a furious look. \"Who is that young man?\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLisette's large red mouth broke into a most alluring smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My lover,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think I'm a fool?\" shouted the Senator. \"I know he's your\nlover.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why do you ask then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMonsieur Le Sueur was a man of action. He went straight up to Lisette\nand smacked her hard on her right cheek with his left hand and then\nsmacked her hard on the left cheek with his right hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Brute,\" screamed Lisette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned to the young man, who had watched this scene of violence with\nsome embarrassment, and, drawing himself to his full height, flung out\nhis arm and with a dramatic finger pointed to the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Get out,\" he cried. \"Get out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne would have thought, such was the commanding aspect of a man who was\naccustomed to sway a crowd of angry tax-payers and who could dominate\nwith his frown an annual meeting of disappointed shareholders, that the\nyoung man would have made a bolt for the door; but he stood his ground,\nirresolutely it is true, but he stood his ground; he gave Lisette an\nappealing look and slightly shrugged his shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you waiting for?\" shouted the Senator. \"Do you want me to use\nforce?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He can't go out in his pyjamas,\" said Lisette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're not his pyjamas, they're my pyjamas.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's waiting for his clothes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMonsieur Le Sueur looked round and on the chair behind him, flung down\nin a disorderly fashion, was a variety of masculine garments. The\nSenator gave the young man a look of contempt.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You may take your clothes, Monsieur,\" he said with cold disdain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe young man picked them up in his arms, gathered up the shoes that\nwere lying about the floor, and quickly left the room. Monsieur Le Sueur\nhad a considerable gift of oratory. Never had he made better use of it\nthan now. He told Lisette what he thought of her. It was not flattering.\nHe painted her ingratitude in the blackest colours. He ransacked an\nextensive vocabulary in order to find opprobrious names to call her. He\ncalled all the powers of heaven to witness that never had a woman repaid\nwith such gross deception an honest man's belief in her. In short he\nsaid everything that anger, wounded vanity and disappointment suggested\nto him. Lisette did not seek to defend herself. She listened in silence,\nlooking down and mechanically crumbling the roll which the Senator's\nappearance had prevented her from finishing. He flung an irritated\nglance at her plate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was so anxious that you should be the first to hear my great news\nthat I came straight here from the station. I was expecting to have my\n<i>petit déjeuner</i> with you, sitting at the end of your bed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My poor dear, haven't you had your breakfast? I'll order some for you\nat once.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want any.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nonsense. With the great responsibility you are about to assume you\nmust keep up your strength.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe rang and when the maid came told her to bring in hot coffee. It was\nbrought and Lisette poured it out. He would not touch it. She buttered a\nroll. He shrugged his shoulders and began to eat. Meanwhile he uttered a\nfew remarks on the perfidy of women. She remained silent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At all events it is something,\" he said, \"that you have not the\neffrontery to attempt to excuse yourself. You know that I am not a man\nwho can be ill-used with impunity. The soul of generosity when people\nbehave well to me I am pitiless when they behave badly. The very moment\nI have drunk my coffee I shall leave this apartment for ever.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLisette sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will tell you now that I had prepared a surprise for you. I had made\nup my mind to celebrate the second anniversary of our union by settling\na sum of money on you sufficient to give you a modest independence if\nanything happened to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How much?\" asked Lisette sombrely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A million francs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe sighed again. Suddenly something soft hit the Senator on the back of\nthe head and he gave a start.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is that?\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's returning your pyjamas.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe young man had opened the door, flung the pyjamas at the Senator's\nhead, and quickly closed it again. The Senator disengaged himself from\nthe silk trousers that clung round his neck.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a way to return them! It is obvious that your friend has no\neducation.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course he has not your distinction,\" murmured Lisette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And has he my intelligence?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, no.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is he rich?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Penniless.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then, name of a name, what is it you see in him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's young,\" smiled Lisette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Senator looked down at his plate and a tear rose in his eyes and\nrolled down his cheek into the coffee. Lisette gave him a kindly look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My poor friend, one can't have everything in this life,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I knew I was not young. But my situation, my fortune, my vitality. I\nthought it made up. There are women who only like men of a certain age.\nThere are celebrated actresses who look upon it as an honour to be the\nlittle friend of a Minister. I am too well brought up to throw your\norigins in your face, but the fact remains that you are a mannequin and\nI took you out of an apartment of which the rent is only two thousand\nfrancs a year. It was a step up for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The daughter of poor but honest parents, I have no reason to be ashamed\nof my origins, and it is not because I have earned my living in a humble\nsphere that you have the right to reproach me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you love this boy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And not me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You too. I love you both, but I love you differently. I love you\nbecause you are so distinguished and your conversation is instructive\nand interesting. I love you because you are kind and generous. I love\nhim because his eyes are so big and his hair waves and he dances\ndivinely. It's very natural.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know that in my position I cannot take you to places where they\ndance and I daresay when he's as old as I am he'll have no more hair\nthan I have.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That may well be true,\" Lisette agreed, but she did not think it much\nmattered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What will your aunt, the respectable Madame Saladin, say to you when\nshe hears what you have done?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It will not be exactly a surprise to her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean to say that worthy woman countenances your conduct? <i>O\ntempora, o mores!</i> How long then has this been going on?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Since I first went to the shop. He travels for a big silk firm in\nLyons. He came in one day with his samples. We liked the look of one\nanother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But your aunt was there to defend you from the temptations to which a\nyoung girl is exposed in Paris. She should never have allowed you to\nhave anything to do with this young man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I did not ask her permission.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is enough to bring the grey hairs of your poor father to the grave.\nHad you no thought of that wounded hero whose services to his country\nhave been rewarded with a licence to sell tobacco? Do you forget that as\nMinister of the Interior the department is under my control? I should be\nwithin my rights if I revoked the licence on account of your flagrant\nimmorality.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know you are too great a gentleman to do a dastardly thing like\nthat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe waved his hand in an impressive, though perhaps too dramatic a\nmanner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be afraid, I will never stoop so low as to revenge myself on one\nwho has deserved well of his country for the misdeeds of a creature my\nsense of dignity forces me to despise.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went on with his interrupted breakfast. Lisette did not speak and\nthere was silence between them. But his appetite satisfied, his mood\nchanged; he began to feel sorry for himself rather than angry with her,\nand with a strange ignorance of woman's heart he thought to arouse\nLisette's remorse by exhibiting himself as an object of pity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is hard to break a habit to which one has grown accustomed. It was a\nrelief and a solace to me to come here when I could snatch a moment from\nmy many occupations. Will you regret me a little, Lisette?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave a deep sigh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should never have thought you capable of so much deception.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is the deception that rankles,\" she murmured thoughtfully. \"Men are\nfunny in that way. They cannot forgive being made fools of. It is\nbecause they are so vain. They attach importance to things that are of\nno consequence.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you call it a matter of no consequence that I should find you having\nbreakfast with a young man wearing my pyjamas?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If he were my husband and you were my lover you would think it\nperfectly natural.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Obviously. For then I should be deceiving him and my honour would be\nsecure.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In short, I have only to marry him to make the situation perfectly\nregular.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a moment he did not understand. Then her meaning flashed across his\nclever brain and he gave her a quick look. Her lovely eyes had the\ntwinkle he always found so alluring and on her large red mouth was the\nsuspicion of a roguish smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do not forget that as a member of the Senate I am by all the traditions\nof the Republic the authorised mainstay of morality and good behaviour.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does that weigh very heavily with you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe stroked his handsome square beard with a composed and dignified\ngesture.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not a row of beans,\" he replied, but the expression he used had a\nGallic breadth that would perhaps have given his more conservative\nsupporters something of a shock.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would he marry you?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He adores me. Of course he would marry me. If I told him I had a <i>dot</i>\nof a million francs he would ask nothing better.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMonsieur Le Sueur gave her another look. When in a moment of anger he\ntold her it had been his intention to settle a million francs on her he\nhad exaggerated a good deal in the desire to make her see how much her\ntreachery was costing her. But he was not the man to draw back when his\ndignity was concerned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is much more than a young man in his position of life could aspire\nto. But if he adores you he would be always at your side.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Didn't I tell you that he was a commercial traveller? He can only come\nto Paris for the week-end.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That of course is a horse of another colour,\" said the Senator. \"It\nwould naturally be a satisfaction to him to know that during his absence\nI should be there to keep an eye on you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A considerable satisfaction,\" said Lisette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo facilitate the conversation she rose from her seat and made herself\ncomfortable on the Senator's knees. He pressed her hand tenderly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am very fond of you, Lisette,\" he said. \"I should not like you to\nmake a mistake. Are you sure he will make you happy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think so.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will have proper enquiries made. I would never consent to your\nmarrying anyone not of exemplary character and unimpeachable morality.\nFor all our sakes we must make quite sure about this young man whom we\nare preparing to bring into our lives.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLisette raised no objection. She was aware that the Senator liked to do\nthings with order and method. He now prepared to leave her. He wanted to\nbreak his important news to Madame Le Sueur, and he had to get in touch\nwith various persons in the parliamentary group to which he belonged.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is only one more thing,\" he said, as he bade Lisette an\naffectionate farewell, \"if you marry I must insist on your giving up\nyour work. The place of a wife is the home, and it is against all my\nprinciples that a married woman should take the bread out of a man's\nmouth.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLisette reflected that a strapping young man would look rather funny\nwalking round the room, with his hips swaying, to show off the latest\nmodels, but she respected the Senator's principles.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It shall be as you wish, darling,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe enquiries he made were satisfactory and the marriage took place on a\nSaturday morning as soon as the legal formalities were completed.\nMonsieur Le Sueur, Minister of the Interior, and Madame Saladin were\nwitnesses. The bridegroom was a slim young man with a straight nose,\nfine eyes and black waving hair brushed straight back from his forehead.\nHe looked more like a tennis-player than a traveller in silk. The Mayor,\nimpressed by the august presence of the Minister of the Interior, made\naccording to French practice a speech which he sought to render\neloquent. He began by telling the married couple what presumably they\nknew already. He informed the bridegroom that he was the son of worthy\nparents and was engaged in an honourable profession. He congratulated\nhim on entering the bonds of matrimony at an age when many young men\nthought only of their pleasures. He reminded the bride that her father\nwas a hero of the great war, whose glorious wounds had been rewarded by\na concession to sell tobacco, and he told her that she had earned a\ndecent living since her arrival in Paris in an establishment that was\none of the glories of French taste and luxury. The Mayor was of a\nliterary turn and he briefly mentioned various celebrated lovers of\nfiction, Romeo and Juliet whose short but legitimate union had been\ninterrupted by a regrettable misunderstanding, Paul and Virginia who had\nmet her death at sea rather than sacrifice her modesty by taking off her\nclothes, and finally Daphnis and Chloe who had not consummated their\nmarriage till it was sanctioned by the legitimate authority. He was so\nmoving that Lisette shed a few tears. He paid a compliment to Madame\nSaladin whose example and precept had preserved her young and beautiful\nniece from the dangers that are likely to befall a young girl alone in a\ngreat city, and finally he congratulated the happy pair on the honour\nthat the Minister of the Interior had done them in consenting to be a\nwitness at the ceremony. It was a testimony to their own probity that\nthis captain of industry and eminent statesman should find time to\nperform a humble office to persons in their modest sphere, and it proved\nnot only the excellence of his heart but his lively sense of duty. His\naction showed that he appreciated the importance of early marriage,\naffirmed the security of the family and emphasised the desirability of\nproducing offspring to increase the power, influence and consequence of\nthe fair land of France. A very good speech indeed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe wedding breakfast was held at the Château de Madrid, which had\nsentimental associations for Monsieur Le Sueur. It has been mentioned\nalready that among his many interests the Minister (as we must now call\nhim) was interested in a firm of motor-cars. His wedding present to the\nbridegroom was a very nice two-seater of his own manufacture, and in\nthis, when lunch was over, the young couple started off for their\nhoneymoon. This could only last over the week-end since the young man\nhad to get back to his work, which would take him to Marseilles, Toulon\nand Nice. Lisette kissed her aunt and she kissed Monsieur Le Sueur.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall expect you at five on Monday,\" she whispered to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall be there,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey drove away and for a moment Monsieur Le Sueur and Madame Saladin\nlooked at the smart yellow roadster.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As long as he makes her happy,\" sighed Madame Saladin, who was not used\nto champagne at lunch and felt unreasonably melancholy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If he does not make her happy he will have me to count with,\" said\nMonsieur Le Sueur impressively.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis car drove up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Au revoir, chère Madame.</i> You will get a bus at the Avenue de\nNeuilly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe stepped into his car and as he thought of the affairs of state that\nawaited his attention he sighed with content. It was evidently much more\nfitting to his situation that his mistress should be, not just a little\nmannequin in a dressmaker's shop, but a respectable married woman.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nOne was called Mrs. Richman and she was a widow. The second was called\nMrs. Sutcliffe; she was American and she had divorced two husbands. The\nthird was called Miss Hickson and she was a spinster. They were all in\nthe comfortable forties and they were all well off. Mrs. Sutcliffe had\nthe odd first name of Arrow. When she was young and slender she had\nliked it well enough. It suited her and the jests it occasioned though\ntoo often repeated were very flattering; she was not disinclined to\nbelieve that it suited her character too: it suggested directness, speed\nand purpose. She liked it less now that her delicate features had grown\nmuzzy with fat, that her arms and shoulders were so substantial and her\nhips so massive. It was increasingly difficult to find dresses to make\nher look as she liked to look. The jests her name gave rise to now were\nmade behind her back and she very well knew that they were far from\nobliging. But she was by no means resigned to middle age. She still wore\nblue to bring out the colour of her eyes and, with the help of art, her\nfair hair had kept its lustre. What she liked about Beatrice Richman and\nFrances Hickson was that they were both so much fatter than she, it made\nher look quite slim; they were both of them older and much inclined to\ntreat her as a little young thing. It was not disagreeable. They were\ngood-natured women and they chaffed her pleasantly about her beaux; they\nhad both given up the thought of that kind of nonsense, indeed Miss\nHickson had never given it a moment's consideration, but they were\nsympathetic to her flirtations. It was understood that one of these days\nArrow would make a third man happy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Only you mustn't get any heavier, darling,\" said Mrs. Richman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And for goodness' sake make certain of his bridge,\" said Miss Hickson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey saw for her a man of about fifty, but well-preserved and of\ndistinguished carriage, an admiral on the retired list and a good\ngolfer, or a widower without encumbrances, but in any case with a\nsubstantial income. Arrow listened to them amiably, and kept to herself\nthat fact that this was not at all her idea. It was true that she would\nhave liked to marry again, but her fancy turned to a dark slim Italian\nwith flashing eyes and a sonorous title or to a Spanish don of noble\nlineage; and not a day more than thirty. There were times when, looking\nat herself in her mirror, she was certain she did not look any more than\nthat herself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were great friends, Miss Hickson, Mrs. Richman and Arrow Sutcliffe.\nIt was their fat that had brought them together and bridge that had\ncemented their alliance. They had met first at Carlsbad, where they were\nstaying at the same hotel and were treated by the same doctor who used\nthem with the same ruthlessness. Beatrice Richman was enormous. She was\na handsome woman, with fine eyes, rouged cheeks and painted lips. She\nwas very well content to be a widow with a handsome fortune. She adored\nher food. She liked bread and butter, cream, potatoes and suet puddings,\nand for eleven months of the year ate pretty well everything she had a\nmind to, and for one month went to Carlsbad to reduce. But every year\nshe grew fatter. She upbraided the doctor, but got no sympathy from him.\nHe pointed out to her various plain and simple facts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But if I'm never to eat a thing I like, life isn't worth living,\" she\nexpostulated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe shrugged his disapproving shoulders. Afterwards she told Miss Hickson\nthat she was beginning to suspect he wasn't so clever as she had\nthought. Miss Hickson gave a great guffaw. She was that sort of woman.\nShe had a deep bass voice, a large flat sallow face from which twinkled\nlittle bright eyes; she walked with a slouch, her hands in her pockets,\nand when she could do so without exciting attention smoked a long cigar.\nShe dressed as like a man as she could.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the deuce should I look like in frills and furbelows?\" she said.\n\"When you're as fat as I am you may just as well be comfortable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe wore tweeds and heavy boots and whenever she could went about\nbareheaded. But she was as strong as an ox and boasted that few men\ncould drive a longer ball than she. She was plain of speech, and she\ncould swear more variously than a stevedore. Though her name was Frances\nshe preferred to be called Frank. Masterful, but with tact, it was her\njovial strength of character that held the three together. They drank\ntheir waters together, had their baths at the same hour, they took their\nstrenuous walks together, pounded about the tennis-court with a\nprofessional to make them run, and ate at the same table their sparse\nand regulated meals. Nothing impaired their good humour but the scales,\nand when one or other of them weighed as much on one day as she had the\nday before neither Frank's coarse jokes, the <i>bonhomie</i> of Beatrice nor\nArrow's pretty kittenish ways sufficed to dispel the gloom. Then drastic\nmeasures were resorted to, the culprit went to bed for twenty-four hours\nand nothing passed her lips but the doctor's famous vegetable soup which\ntasted like hot water in which a cabbage had been well rinsed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNever were three women greater friends. They would have been independent\nof anyone else if they had not needed a fourth at bridge. They were\nfierce, enthusiastic players and the moment the day's cure was over they\nsat down at the bridge table. Arrow, feminine as she was, played the\nbest game of the three, a hard, brilliant game, in which she showed no\nmercy and never conceded a point or failed to take advantage of a\nmistake. Beatrice was solid and reliable. Frank was dashing; she was a\ngreat theorist, and had all the authorities at the tip of her tongue.\nThey had long arguments over the rival systems. They bombarded one\nanother with Culbertson and Sims. It was obvious that not one of them\never played a card without fifteen good reasons, but it was also obvious\nfrom the subsequent conversation that there were fifteen equally good\nreasons why she should not have played it. Life would have been perfect,\neven with the prospect of twenty-four hours of that filthy soup when the\ndoctor's rotten (Beatrice) bloody (Frank) lousy (Arrow) scales pretended\none hadn't lost an ounce in two days, if only there had not been this\nconstant difficulty of finding someone to play with them who was in\ntheir class.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was for this reason that on the occasion with which this narrative\ndeals Frank invited Lena Finch to come and stay with them at Antibes.\nThey were spending some weeks there on Frank's suggestion. It seemed\nabsurd to her, with her common sense, that immediately the cure was over\nBeatrice who always lost twenty pounds should by giving way to her\nungovernable appetite put it all on again. Beatrice was weak. She needed\na person of strong will to watch her diet. She proposed then that on\nleaving Carlsbad they should take a house at Antibes, where they could\nget plenty of exercise--everyone knew that nothing slimmed you like\nswimming--and as far as possible could go on with the cure. With a cook\nof their own they could at least avoid things that were obviously\nfattening. There was no reason why they should not all lose several\npounds more. It seemed a very good idea. Beatrice knew what was good for\nher, and she could resist temptation well enough if temptation was not\nput right under her nose. Besides, she liked gambling, and a flutter at\nthe Casino two or three times a week would pass the time very\npleasantly. Arrow adored Antibes, and she would be looking her best\nafter a month at Carlsbad. She could just pick and choose among the\nyoung Italians, the passionate Spaniards, the gallant Frenchmen, and the\nlong-limbed English who sauntered about all day in bathing trunks and\ngay-coloured dressing-gowns. The plan worked very well. They had a grand\ntime. Two days a week they ate nothing but hard-boiled eggs and raw\ntomatoes and they mounted the scales every morning with light hearts.\nArrow got down to eleven stone and felt just like a girl; Beatrice and\nFrank by standing in a certain way just avoided the thirteen. The\nmachine they had bought registered kilogrammes, and they got\nextraordinarily clever at translating these in the twinkling of an eye\nto pounds and ounces.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the fourth at bridge continued to be the difficulty. This person\nplayed like a foot, the other was so slow that it drove you frantic, one\nwas quarrelsome, another was a bad loser, a third was next door to a\ncrook. It was strange how hard it was to find exactly the player you\nwanted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne morning when they were sitting in pyjamas on the terrace overlooking\nthe sea, drinking their tea (without milk or sugar) and eating a rusk\nprepared by Dr. Hudebert and guaranteed not to be fattening, Frank\nlooked up from her letters.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Lena Finch is coming down to the Riviera,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who's she?\" asked Arrow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She married a cousin of mine. He died a couple of months ago and she's\njust recovering from a nervous breakdown. What about asking her to come\nhere for a fortnight?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does she play bridge?\" asked Beatrice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You bet your life she does,\" boomed Frank in her deep voice. \"And a\ndamned good game too. We should be absolutely independent of outsiders.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How old is she?\" asked Arrow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Same age as I am.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That sounds all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was settled. Frank, with her usual decisiveness, stalked out as soon\nas she had finished her breakfast to send a wire, and three days later\nLena Finch arrived. Frank met her at the station. She was in deep but\nnot obtrusive mourning for the recent death of her husband. Frank had\nnot seen her for two years. She kissed her warmly and took a good look\nat her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're very thin, darling,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLena smiled bravely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've been through a good deal lately. I've lost a lot of weight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFrank sighed, but whether from sympathy with her cousin's sad loss, or\nfrom envy, was not obvious.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLena was not, however, unduly depressed, and after a quick bath was\nquite ready to accompany Frank to Eden Roc. Frank introduced the\nstranger to her two friends and they sat down in what was known as the\nMonkey House. It was an enclosure covered with glass overlooking the\nsea, with a bar at the back, and it was crowded with chattering people\nin bathing costumes, pyjamas or dressing-gowns, who were seated at the\ntables having drinks. Beatrice's soft heart went out to the lorn widow,\nand Arrow, seeing that she was pale, quite ordinary to look at and\nprobably forty-eight, was prepared to like her very much. A waiter\napproached them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What will you have, Lena dear?\" Frank asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I don't know, what you all have, a dry Martini or a White Lady.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nArrow and Beatrice gave her a quick look. Everyone knows how fattening\ncocktails are.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I daresay you're tired after your journey,\" said Frank kindly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe ordered a dry Martini for Lena and a mixed lemon and orange juice\nfor herself and her two friends.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We find alcohol isn't very good in all this heat,\" she explained.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, it never affects me at all,\" Lena answered airily. \"I like\ncocktails.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nArrow went very slightly pale under her rouge (neither she nor Beatrice\never wet their faces when they bathed and they thought it absurd of\nFrank, a woman of her size, to pretend she liked diving) but she said\nnothing. The conversation was gay and easy, they all said the obvious\nthings with gusto, and presently they strolled back to the villa for\nluncheon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn each napkin were two little antifat rusks. Lena gave a bright smile\nas she put them by the side of her plate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"May I have some bread?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe grossest indecency would not have fallen on the ears of those three\nwomen with such a shock. Not one of them had eaten bread for ten years.\nEven Beatrice, greedy as she was, drew the line there. Frank, the good\nhostess, recovered herself first.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course, darling,\" she said and turning to the butler asked him to\nbring some.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And some butter,\" said Lena in that pleasant easy way of hers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a moment's embarrassed silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know if there's any in the house,\" said Frank, \"but I'll\nenquire. There may be some in the kitchen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I adore bread and butter, don't you?\" said Lena, turning to Beatrice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBeatrice gave a sickly smile and an evasive reply. The butler brought a\nlong crisp roll of French bread. Lena slit it in two and plastered it\nwith the butter which was miraculously produced. A grilled sole was\nserved.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We eat very simply here,\" said Frank. \"I hope you won't mind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, no, I like my food very plain,\" said Lena as she took some butter\nand spread it over her fish. \"As long as I can have bread and butter and\npotatoes and cream I'm quite happy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe three friends exchanged a glance. Frank's great sallow face sagged a\nlittle and she looked with distaste at the dry, insipid sole on her\nplate. Beatrice came to the rescue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's such a bore, we can't get cream here,\" she said. \"It's one of the\nthings one has to do without on the Riviera.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a pity,\" said Lena.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe rest of the luncheon consisted of lamb cutlets, with the fat\ncarefully removed so that Beatrice should not be led astray, and spinach\nboiled in water, with stewed pears to end up with. Lena tasted her pears\nand gave the butler a look of enquiry. That resourceful man understood\nher at once and though powdered sugar had never been served at that\ntable before handed her without a moment's hesitation a bowl of it. She\nhelped herself liberally. The other three pretended not to notice.\nCoffee was served and Lena took three lumps of sugar in hers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You have a very sweet tooth,\" said Arrow in a tone which she struggled\nto keep friendly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We think saccharine so much more sweetening,\" said Frank, as she put a\ntiny tablet of it into her coffee.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Disgusting stuff,\" said Lena.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBeatrice's mouth drooped at the corners, and she gave the lump sugar a\nyearning look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Beatrice,\" boomed Frank sternly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBeatrice stifled a sigh, and reached for the saccharine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFrank was relieved when they could sit down to the bridge table. It was\nplain to her that Arrow and Beatrice were upset. She wanted them to like\nLena and she was anxious that Lena should enjoy her fortnight with them.\nFor the first rubber Arrow cut with the newcomer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you play Vanderbilt or Culbertson?\" she asked her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have no conventions,\" Lena answered in a happy-go-lucky way, \"I play\nby the light of nature.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I play strict Culbertson,\" said Arrow acidly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe three fat women braced themselves to the fray. No conventions\nindeed! They'd learn her. When it came to bridge even Frank's family\nfeeling was forgotten and she settled down with the same determination\nas the others to trim the stranger in their midst. But the light of\nnature served Lena very well. She had a natural gift for the game and\ngreat experience. She played with imagination, quickly, boldly, and with\nassurance. The other players were in too high a class not to realise\nvery soon that Lena knew what she was about, and since they were all\nthoroughly good-natured, generous women, they were gradually mollified.\nThis was real bridge. They all enjoyed themselves. Arrow and Beatrice\nbegan to feel more kindly towards Lena, and Frank, noticing this, heaved\na fat sigh of relief. It was going to be a success.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter a couple of hours they parted, Frank and Beatrice to have a round\nof golf, and Arrow to take a brisk walk with a young Prince Roccamare\nwhose acquaintance she had lately made. He was very sweet and young and\ngood-looking. Lena said she would rest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey met again just before dinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope you've been all right, Lena dear,\" said Frank. \"I was rather\nconscience-stricken at leaving you with nothing to do all this time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, don't apologise. I had a lovely sleep and then I went down to Juan\nand had a cocktail. And d'you know what I discovered? You'll be so\npleased. I found a dear little tea-shop where they've got the most\nbeautiful thick fresh cream. I've ordered half a pint to be sent every\nday. I thought it would be my little contribution to the household.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer eyes were shining. She was evidently expecting them to be delighted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How very kind of you,\" said Frank, with a look that sought to quell the\nindignation that she saw on the faces of her two friends. \"But we never\neat cream. In this climate it makes one so bilious.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall have to eat it all myself then,\" said Lena cheerfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you ever think of your figure?\" Arrow asked with icy\ndeliberation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The doctor said I must eat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did he say you must eat bread and butter and potatoes and cream?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. That's what I thought you meant when you said you had simple\nfood.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll get simply enormous,\" said Beatrice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLena laughed gaily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I shan't. You see, nothing ever makes me fat. I've always eaten\neverything I wanted to and it's never had the slightest effect on me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe stony silence that followed this speech was only broken by the\nentrance of the butler.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Mademoiselle est servie</i>,\" he announced.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey talked the matter over late that night, after Lena had gone to bed,\nin Frank's room. During the evening they had been furiously cheerful,\nand they had chaffed one another with a friendliness that would have\ntaken in the keenest observer. But now they dropped the mask. Beatrice\nwas sullen, Arrow was spiteful and Frank was unmanned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not very nice for me to sit there and see her eat all the things I\nparticularly like,\" said Beatrice plaintively.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not very nice for any of us,\" Frank snapped back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You should never have asked her here,\" said Arrow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How was I to know?\" cried Frank.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't help thinking that if she really cared for her husband she\nwould hardly eat so much,\" said Beatrice. \"He's only been buried two\nmonths. I mean, I think you ought to show some respect for the dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why can't she eat the same as we do?\" asked Arrow viciously. \"She's a\nguest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you heard what she said. The doctor told her she must eat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then she ought to go to a sanatorium.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's more than flesh and blood can stand, Frank,\" moaned Beatrice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If I can stand it you can stand it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's your cousin, she's not our cousin,\" said Arrow. \"I'm not going to\nsit there for fourteen days and watch that woman make a hog of herself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's so vulgar to attach all this importance to food,\" Frank boomed,\nand her voice was deeper than ever. \"After all the only thing that\ncounts really is spirit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you calling <i>me</i> vulgar, Frank?\" asked Arrow with flashing eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, of course she isn't,\" interrupted Beatrice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't put it past you to go down in the kitchen when we're all in\nbed and have a good square meal on the sly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFrank sprang to her feet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How dare you say that, Arrow! I'd never ask anybody to do what I'm not\nprepared to do myself. Have you known me all these years and do you\nthink me capable of such a mean thing?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How is it you never take off any weight then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFrank gave a gasp and burst into a flood of tears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a cruel thing to say! I've lost pounds and pounds.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe wept like a child. Her vast body shook and great tears splashed on\nher mountainous bosom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Darling, I didn't mean it,\" cried Arrow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe threw herself on her knees and enveloped what she could of Frank in\nher own plump arms. She wept and the mascara ran down her cheeks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you mean to say I don't look thinner?\" Frank sobbed. \"After all I've\ngone through.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, dear, of course you do,\" cried Arrow through her tears.\n\"Everybody's noticed it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBeatrice, though naturally of a placid disposition, began to cry gently.\nIt was very pathetic. Indeed, it would have been a hard heart that\nfailed to be moved by the sight of Frank, that lion-hearted woman,\ncrying her eyes out. Presently, however, they dried their tears and had\na little brandy and water, which every doctor had told them was the\nleast fattening thing they could drink, and then they felt much better.\nThey decided that Lena should have the nourishing food that had been\nordered her and they made a solemn resolution not to let it disturb\ntheir equanimity. She was certainly a first-rate bridge player and after\nall it was only for a fortnight. They would do whatever they could to\nmake her stay enjoyable. They kissed one another warmly and separated\nfor the night feeling strangely uplifted. Nothing should interfere with\nthe wonderful friendship that had brought so much happiness into their\nthree lives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut human nature is weak. You must not ask too much of it. They ate\ngrilled fish while Lena ate macaroni sizzling with cheese and butter;\nthey ate grilled cutlets and boiled spinach while Lena ate <i>pâté de foie\ngras</i>; twice a week they ate hard-boiled eggs and raw tomatoes, while\nLena ate peas swimming in cream and potatoes cooked in all sorts of\ndelicious ways. The chef was a good chef and he leapt at the opportunity\nafforded him to send up one dish more rich, tasty and succulent than the\nother.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor Jim,\" sighed Lena, thinking of her husband, \"he loved French\ncooking.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe butler disclosed the fact that he could make half a dozen kinds of\ncocktail and Lena informed them that the doctor had recommended her to\ndrink burgundy at luncheon and champagne at dinner. The three fat women\npersevered. They were gay, chatty and even hilarious (such is the\nnatural gift that women have for deception) but Beatrice grew limp and\nforlorn, and Arrow's tender blue eyes acquired a steely glint. Frank's\ndeep voice grew more raucous. It was when they played bridge that the\nstrain showed itself. They had always been fond of talking over their\nhands, but their discussions had been friendly. Now a distinct\nbitterness crept in and sometimes one pointed out a mistake to another\nwith quite unnecessary frankness. Discussion turned to argument and\nargument to altercation. Sometimes the session ended in angry silence.\nOnce Frank accused Arrow of deliberately letting her down. Two or three\ntimes Beatrice, the softest of the three, was reduced to tears. On\nanother occasion Arrow flung down her cards and swept out of the room in\na pet. Their tempers were getting frayed. Lena was the peacemaker.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think it's such a pity to quarrel over bridge,\" she said. \"After all,\nit's only a game.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was all very well for her. She had had a square meal and half a\nbottle of champagne. Besides, she had phenomenal luck. She was winning\nall their money. The score was put down in a book after each session,\nand hers mounted up day after day with unfailing regularity. Was there\nno justice in the world? They began to hate one another. And though they\nhated her too they could not resist confiding in her. Each of them went\nto her separately and told her how detestable the others were. Arrow\nsaid she was sure it was bad for her to see so much of women so much\nolder than herself. She had a good mind to sacrifice her share of the\nlease and go to Venice for the rest of the summer. Frank told Lena that\nwith her masculine mind it was too much to expect that she could be\nsatisfied with anyone so frivolous as Arrow and so frankly stupid as\nBeatrice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must have intellectual conversation,\" she boomed. \"When you have a\nbrain like mine you've got to consort with your intellectual equals.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBeatrice only wanted peace and quiet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Really I hate women,\" she said. \"They're so unreliable; they're so\nmalicious.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBy the time Lena's fortnight drew to its close the three fat women were\nbarely on speaking terms. They kept up appearances before Lena, but when\nshe was not there made no pretences. They had got past quarrelling. They\nignored one another, and when this was not possible treated each other\nwith icy politeness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLena was going to stay with friends on the Italian Riviera and Frank saw\nher off by the same train as that by which she had arrived. She was\ntaking away with her a lot of their money.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know how to thank you,\" she said, as she got into the carriage.\n\"I've had a wonderful visit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIf there was one thing that Frank Hickson prided herself on more than on\nbeing a match for any man it was that she was a gentlewoman, and her\nreply was perfect in its combination of majesty and graciousness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We've all enjoyed having you here, Lena,\" she said. \"It's been a real\ntreat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut when she turned away from the departing train she heaved such a vast\nsigh of relief that the platform shook beneath her. She flung back her\nmassive shoulders and strode home to the villa.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ouf!\" she roared at intervals. \"Ouf!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe changed into her one-piece bathing-suit, put on her espadrilles and\na man's dressing-gown (no nonsense about it) and went to Eden Roc. There\nwas still time for a bathe before luncheon. She passed through the\nMonkey House, looking about her to say good-morning to anyone she knew,\nfor she felt on a sudden at peace with mankind, and then stopped dead\nstill. She could not believe her eyes. Beatrice was sitting at one of\nthe tables, by herself; she wore the pyjamas she had bought at\nMolyneux's a day or two before, she had a string of pearls round her\nneck, and Frank's quick eyes saw that she had just had her hair waved;\nher cheeks, her eyes, her lips were made up. Fat, nay vast, as she was,\nnone could deny that she was an extremely handsome woman. But what was\nshe doing? With the slouching gait of the Neanderthal man which was\nFrank's characteristic walk she went up to Beatrice. In her black\nbathing-dress Frank looked like the huge cetacean which the Japanese\ncatch in the Torres Straits and which the vulgar call a sea-cow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Beatrice, what are you doing?\" she cried in her deep voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was like the roll of thunder in the distant mountains. Beatrice\nlooked at her coolly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Eating,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damn it, I can see you're eating.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn front of Beatrice was a plate of <i>croissants</i> and a plate of butter,\na pot of strawberry jam, coffee and a jug of cream. Beatrice was\nspreading butter thick on the delicious hot bread, covering this with\njam, and then pouring the thick cream over all.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll kill yourself,\" said Frank.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't care,\" mumbled Beatrice with her mouth full.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll put on pounds and pounds.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go to hell!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe actually laughed in Frank's face. My God, how good those\n<i>croissants</i> smelt!\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm disappointed in you, Beatrice. I thought you had more character.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's your fault. That blasted woman. You would have her down. For a\nfortnight I've watched her gorge like a hog. It's more than flesh and\nblood can stand. I'm going to have one square meal if I bust.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe tears welled up to Frank's eyes. Suddenly she felt very weak and\nwomanly. She would have liked a strong man to take her on his knee and\npet her and cuddle her and call her little baby names. Speechless she\nsank down on a chair by Beatrice's side. A waiter came up. With a\npathetic gesture she waved towards the coffee and <i>croissants</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll have the same,\" she sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe listlessly reached out her hand to take a roll, but Beatrice\nsnatched away the plate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, you don't,\" she said. \"You wait till you get your own.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFrank called her a name which ladies seldom apply to one another in\naffection. In a moment the waiter brought her <i>croissants</i> butter, jam\nand coffee.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where's the cream, you fool?\" she roared like a lioness at bay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe began to eat. She ate gluttonously. The place was beginning to fill\nup with bathers coming to enjoy a cocktail or two after having done\ntheir duty by the sun and the sea. Presently Arrow strolled along with\nPrince Roccamare. She had on a beautiful silk wrap which she held\ntightly round her with one hand in order to look as slim as possible and\nshe bore her head high so that he should not see her double chin. She\nwas laughing gaily. She felt like a girl. He had just told her (in\nItalian) that her eyes made the blue of the Mediterranean look like\npea-soup. He left her to go into the men's room to brush his sleek black\nhair and they arranged to meet in five minutes for a drink. Arrow walked\non to the women's room to put a little more rouge on her cheeks and a\nlittle more red on her lips. On her way she caught sight of Frank and\nBeatrice. She stopped. She could hardly believe her eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My God!\" she cried. \"You beasts. You hogs.\" She seized a chair.\n\"Waiter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer appointment went clean out of her head. In the twinkling of an eye\nthe waiter was at her side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bring me what these ladies are having,\" she ordered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFrank lifted her great heavy head from her plate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bring me some <i>pâté de foie gras</i>,\" she boomed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Frank!\" cried Beatrice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shut up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right. I'll have some too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe coffee was brought and the hot rolls and cream and the <i>pâté de foie\ngras</i> and they set to. They spread the cream on the <i>pâté</i> and they ate\nit. They devoured great spoonfuls of jam. They crunched the delicious\ncrisp bread voluptuously. What was love to Arrow then? Let the Prince\nkeep his palace in Rome and his castle in the Apennines. They did not\nspeak. What they were about was much too serious. They ate with solemn,\necstatic fervour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't eaten potatoes for twenty-five years,\" said Frank in a\nfar-off brooding tone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Waiter,\" cried Beatrice, \"bring fried potatoes for three.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Très bien, Madame.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe potatoes were brought. Not all the perfumes of Arabia smelt so\nsweet. They ate them with their fingers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bring me a dry Martini,\" said Arrow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't have a dry Martini in the middle of a meal, Arrow,\" said\nFrank.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can't I? You wait and see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right then. Bring me a double dry Martini,\" said Frank.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bring three double dry Martinis,\" said Beatrice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were brought and drunk at a gulp. The women looked at one another\nand sighed. The misunderstandings of the last fortnight dissolved and\nthe sincere affection each had for the other welled up again in their\nhearts. They could hardly believe that they had ever contemplated the\npossibility of severing a friendship that had brought them so much solid\nsatisfaction. They finished the potatoes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder if they've got any chocolate éclairs,\" said Beatrice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course they have.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd of course they had. Frank thrust one whole into her huge mouth,\nswallowed it and seized another, but before she ate it she looked at the\nother two and plunged a vindictive dagger into the heart of the\nmonstrous Lena.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can say what you like, but the truth is she played a damned rotten\ngame of bridge, really.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Lousy,\" agreed Arrow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Beatrice suddenly thought she would like a meringue.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nIt was Henry Garnet's habit on leaving the city of an afternoon to drop\nin at his club and play bridge before going home to dinner. He was a\npleasant man to play with. He knew the game well and you could be sure\nthat he would make the best of his cards. He was a good loser; and when\nhe won was more inclined to ascribe his success to his luck than to his\nskill. He was indulgent, and if his partner made a mistake could be\ntrusted to find an excuse for him. It was surprising then on this\noccasion to hear him telling his partner with unnecessary sharpness that\nhe had never seen a hand worse played; and it was more surprising still\nto see him not only make a grave error himself, an error of which you\nwould never have thought him capable, but when his partner, not\nunwilling to get a little of his own back, pointed it out, insist\nagainst all reason and with considerable heat that he was perfectly\nright. But they were all old friends, the men he was playing with, and\nnone of them took his ill-humour very seriously. Henry Garnet was a\nbroker, a partner in a firm of repute, and it occurred to one of them\nthat something had gone wrong with some stock he was interested in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How's the market to-day?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Booming. Even the suckers are making money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was evident that stocks and shares had nothing to do with Henry\nGarnet's vexation; but something was the matter; that was evident too.\nHe was a hearty fellow, who enjoyed excellent health; he had plenty of\nmoney; he was fond of his wife and devoted to his children. As a rule he\nhad high spirits, and he laughed easily at the nonsense they were apt to\ntalk while they played; but to-day he sat glum and silent. His brows\nwere crossly puckered and there was a sulky look about his mouth.\nPresently, to ease the tension, one of the others mentioned a subject\nupon which they all knew Henry Garnet was glad to speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How's your boy, Henry? I see he's done pretty well in the tournament.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHenry Garnet's frown grew darker.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's done no better than I expected him to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When does he come back from Monte?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He got back last night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did he enjoy himself?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose so; all I know is that he made a damned fool of himself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh. How?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd rather not talk about it if you don't mind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe three men looked at him with curiosity. Henry Garnet scowled at the\ngreen baize.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sorry, old boy. Your call.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe game proceeded in a strained silence. Garnet got his bid, and when\nhe played his cards so badly that he went three down not a word was\nsaid. Another rubber was begun and in the second game Garnet denied a\nsuit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Having none?\" his partner asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGarnet's irritability was such that he did not even reply, and when at\nthe end of the hand it appeared that he had revoked, and that his revoke\ncost the rubber, it was not to be expected that his partner should let\nhis carelessness go without remark.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the devil's the matter with you, Henry?\" he said. \"You're playing\nlike a fool.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGarnet was disconcerted. He did not so much mind losing a big rubber\nhimself, but he was sore that his inattention should have made his\npartner lose too. He pulled himself together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd better not play any more. I thought a few rubbers would calm me,\nbut the fact is I can't give my mind to the game. To tell you the truth\nI'm in a hell of a temper.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey all burst out laughing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't have to tell us that, old boy. It's obvious.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGarnet gave them a rueful smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I bet you'd be in a temper if what's happened to me had happened\nto you. As a matter of fact I'm in a damned awkward situation, and if\nany of you fellows can give me any advice how to deal with it I'd be\ngrateful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let's have a drink and you tell us all about it. With a K.C., a Home\nOffice official and an eminent surgeon--if we can't tell you how to deal\nwith a situation, nobody can.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe K.C. got up and rang the bell for a waiter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's about that damned boy of mine,\" said Henry Garnet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDrinks were ordered and brought. And this is the story that Henry Garnet\ntold them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe boy of whom he spoke was his only son. His name was Nicholas and of\ncourse he was called Nicky. He was eighteen. The Garnets had two\ndaughters besides, one of sixteen and the other of twelve, but however\nunreasonable it seemed, for a father is generally supposed to like his\ndaughters best, and though he did all he could not to show his\npreference, there was no doubt that the greater share of Henry Garnet's\naffection was given to his son. He was kind, in a chaffing, casual way,\nto his daughters, and gave them handsome presents on their birthdays and\nat Christmas; but he doted on Nicky. Nothing was too good for him. He\nthought the world of him. He could hardly take his eyes off him. You\ncould not blame him, for Nicky was a son that any parent might have been\nproud of. He was six foot two, lithe but muscular, with broad shoulders\nand a slim waist, and he held himself gallantly erect; he had a charming\nhead, well placed on the shoulders, with pale brown hair that waved\nslightly, blue eyes with long dark lashes under well-marked eyebrows, a\nfull red mouth and a tanned, clean skin. When he smiled he showed very\nregular and very white teeth. He was not shy, but there was a modesty in\nhis demeanour that was attractive. In social intercourse he was easy,\npolite and quietly gay. He was the offspring of nice, healthy, decent\nparents, he had been well brought up in a good home, he had been sent to\na good school, and the general result was as engaging a specimen of\nyoung manhood as you were likely to find in a long time. You felt that\nhe was as honest, open and virtuous as he looked. He had never given his\nparents a moment's uneasiness. As a child he was seldom ill and never\nnaughty. As a boy he did everything that was expected of him. His school\nreports were excellent. He was wonderfully popular, and he ended his\ncareer, with a creditable number of prizes, as head of the school and\ncaptain of the football team. But this was not all. At the age of\nfourteen Nicky had developed an unexpected gift for lawn tennis. This\nwas a game that his father not only was fond of, but played very well,\nand when he discerned in the boy the promise of a tennis-player he\nfostered it. During the holidays he had him taught by the best\nprofessionals and by the time he was sixteen he had won a number of\ntournaments for boys of his age. He could beat his father so badly that\nonly parental affection reconciled the older player to the poor show he\nput up. At eighteen Nicky went to Cambridge and Henry Garnet conceived\nthe ambition that before he was through with the university he should\nplay for it. Nicky had all the qualifications for becoming a great\ntennis-player. He was tall, he had a long reach, he was quick on his\nfeet and his timing was perfect. He realised instinctively where the\nball was coming and, seemingly without hurry, was there to take it. He\nhad a powerful serve, with a nasty break that made it difficult to\nreturn, and his forehand drive, low, long and accurate, was deadly. He\nwas not so good on the backhand and his volleying was wild, but all\nthrough the summer before he went to Cambridge Henry Garnet made him\nwork on these points under the best teacher in England. At the back of\nhis mind, though he did not even mention it to Nicky, he cherished a\nfurther ambition, to see his son play at Wimbledon, and who could tell,\nperhaps be chosen to represent his country in the Davis Cup. A great\nlump came into Henry Garnet's throat as he saw in fancy his son leap\nover the net to shake hands with the American champion whom he had just\ndefeated, and walk off the court to the deafening plaudits of the\nmultitude.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs an assiduous frequenter of Wimbledon Henry Garnet had a good many\nfriends in the tennis world, and one evening he found himself at a City\ndinner sitting next to one of them, a Colonel Brabazon, and in due\ncourse began talking to him of Nicky and what chance there might be of\nhis being chosen to play for his university during the following season.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why don't you let him go down to Monte Carlo and play in the spring\ntournament there?\" said the Colonel suddenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I don't think he's good enough for that. He's not nineteen yet, he\nonly went up to Cambridge last October; he wouldn't stand a chance\nagainst all those cracks.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course, Austin and von Cramm and so on would knock spots off him,\nbut he might snatch a game or two; and if he got up against some of the\nsmaller fry there's no reason why he shouldn't win two or three matches.\nHe's never been up against any of the first-rate players and it would be\nwonderful practice for him. He'd learn a lot more than he'll ever learn\nin the seaside tournaments you enter him for.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't dream of it. I'm not going to let him leave Cambridge in the\nmiddle of a term. I've always impressed upon him that tennis is only a\ngame and it mustn't interfere with work.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nColonel Brabazon asked Garnet when the term ended.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's all right. He'd only have to cut about three days. Surely that\ncould be arranged. You see, two of the men we were depending on have let\nus down, and we're in a hole. We want to send as good a team as we can.\nThe Germans are sending their best players and so are the Americans.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing doing, old boy. In the first place Nicky's not good enough, and\nsecondly, I don't fancy the idea of sending a kid like that to Monte\nCarlo without anyone to look after him. If I could get away myself I\nmight think of it, but that's out of the question.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall be there. I'm going as the non-playing captain of the English\nteam. I'll keep an eye on him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll be busy, and besides, it's not a responsibility I'd like to ask\nyou to take. He's never been abroad in his life, and to tell you the\ntruth, I shouldn't have a moment's peace all the time he was there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey left it at that and presently Henry Garnet went home. He was so\nflattered by Colonel Brabazon's suggestion that he could not help\ntelling his wife.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fancy his thinking Nicky's as good as that. He told me he'd seen him\nplay and his style was fine. He only wants more practice to get into the\nfirst flight. We shall see the kid playing in the semi-finals at\nWimbledon yet, old girl.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo his surprise Mrs. Garnet was not so much opposed to the notion as he\nwould have expected.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After all the boy's eighteen. Nicky's never got into mischief yet and\nthere's no reason to suppose he will now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's his work to be considered; don't forget that. I think it would\nbe a very bad precedent to let him cut the end of term.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what can three days matter? It seems a shame to rob him of a chance\nlike that. I'm sure he'd jump at it if you asked him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'm not going to. I haven't sent him to Cambridge just to play\ntennis. I know he's steady, but it's silly to put temptation in his way.\nHe's much too young to go to Monte Carlo by himself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You say he won't have a chance against these crack players, but you\ncan't tell.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHenry Garnet sighed a little. On the way home in the car it had struck\nhim that Austin's health was uncertain and that von Cramm had his\noff-days. Supposing, just for the sake of argument, that Nicky had a bit\nof luck like that--then there would be no doubt that he would be chosen\nto play for Cambridge. But of course that was all nonsense.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing doing, my dear. I've made up my mind and I'm not going to\nchange it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Garnet held her peace. But next day she wrote to Nicky, telling him\nwhat had happened, and suggested to him what she would do in his place\nif, wanting to go, he wished to get his father's consent. A day or two\nlater Henry Garnet received a letter from his son. He was bubbling over\nwith excitement. He had seen his tutor, who was a tennis-player himself,\nand the Provost of his college, who happened to know Colonel Brabazon,\nand no objection would be made to his leaving before the end of term;\nthey both thought it an opportunity that shouldn't be missed. He didn't\nsee what harm he could come to, and if only, just this once, his father\nwould stretch a point, well, next term, he promised faithfully, he'd\nwork like blazes. It was a very pretty letter. Mrs. Garnet watched her\nhusband read it at the breakfast table; she was undisturbed by the frown\non his face. He threw it over to her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know why you thought it necessary to tell Nicky something I\ntold you in confidence. It's too bad of you. Now you've thoroughly\nunsettled him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry. I thought it would please him to know that Colonel Brabazon\nhad such a high opinion of him. I don't see why one should only tell\npeople the disagreeable things that are said about them. Of course I\nmade it quite clear that there could be no question of his going.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've put me in an odious position. If there's anything I hate it's\nfor the boy to look upon me as a spoil-sport and a tyrant.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, he'll never do that. He may think you rather silly and\nunreasonable, but I'm sure he'll understand that it's only for his own\ngood that you're being so unkind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Christ,\" said Henry Garnet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis wife had a great inclination to laugh. She knew the battle was won.\nDear, oh dear, how easy it was to get men to do what you wanted. For\nappearance sake Henry Garnet held out for forty-eight hours, but then he\nyielded, and a fortnight later Nicky came to London. He was to start for\nMonte Carlo next morning, and after dinner, when Mrs. Garnet and her\nelder daughter had left them, Henry took the opportunity to give his son\nsome good advice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't feel quite comfortable about letting you go off to a place like\nMonte Carlo at your age practically by yourself,\" he finished, \"but\nthere it is and I can only hope you'll be sensible. I don't want to play\nthe heavy father, but there are three things especially that I want to\nwarn you against: one is gambling, don't gamble; the second is money,\ndon't lend anyone money; and the third is women, don't have anything to\ndo with women. If you don't do any of those three things you can't come\nto much harm, so remember them well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right, father,\" Nicky smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's my last word to you. I know the world pretty well and believe\nme, my advice is sound.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I won't forget it. I promise you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's a good chap. Now let's go up and join the ladies.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNicky beat neither Austin nor von Cramm in the Monte Carlo tournament,\nbut he did not disgrace himself. He snatched an unexpected victory over\na Spanish player and gave one of the Austrians a closer match than\nanyone had thought possible. In the mixed doubles he got into the\nsemi-finals. His charm conquered everyone and he vastly enjoyed himself.\nIt was generally allowed that he showed promise, and Colonel Brabazon\ntold him that when he was a little older and had had more practice with\nfirst-class players he would be a credit to his father. The tournament\ncame to an end and the day following he was to fly back to London.\nAnxious to play his best he had lived very carefully, smoking little and\ndrinking nothing, and going to bed early; but on his last evening he\nthought he would like to see something of the life in Monte Carlo of\nwhich he had heard so much. An official dinner was given to the\ntennis-players and after dinner with the rest of them he went into the\nSporting Club. It was the first time he had been there. Monte Carlo was\nvery full and the rooms were crowded. Nicky had never before seen\nroulette played except in the pictures; in a maze he stopped at the\nfirst table he came to; chips of different sizes were scattered over the\ngreen cloth in what looked like a hopeless muddle; the croupier gave the\nwheel a sharp turn and with a flick threw in the little white ball.\nAfter what seemed an endless time the ball stopped and another croupier\nwith a broad, indifferent gesture raked in the chips of those who had\nlost.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPresently Nicky wandered over to where they were playing <i>trente et\nquarante</i>, but he couldn't understand what it was all about and he\nthought it dull. He saw a crowd in another room and sauntered in. A big\ngame of baccara was in progress and he was immediately conscious of the\ntension. The players were protected from the thronging bystanders by a\nbrass rail; they sat round the table, nine on each side, with the dealer\nin the middle and the croupier facing him. Big money was changing hands.\nThe dealer was a member of the Greek Syndicate. Nicky looked at his\nimpassive face. His eyes were watchful, but his expression never changed\nwhether he won or lost. It was a terrifying, strangely impressive sight.\nIt gave Nicky, who had been thriftily brought up, a peculiar thrill to\nsee someone risk a thousand pounds on the turn of a card and when he\nlost make a little joke and laugh. It was all terribly exciting. An\nacquaintance came up to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Been doing any good?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't been playing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wise of you. Rotten game. Come and have a drink.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhile they were having it Nicky told his friends that this was the first\ntime he had ever been in the rooms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, but you must have one little flutter before you go. It's idiotic to\nleave Monte without having tried your luck. After all it won't hurt you\nto lose a hundred francs or so.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't suppose it will, but my father wasn't any too keen on my coming\nat all and one of the three things he particularly advised me not to do\nwas to gamble.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut when Nicky left his companion he strolled back to one of the tables\nwhere they were playing roulette. He stood for a while looking at the\nlosers' money being raked-in by the croupier and the money that was won\npaid out to the winners. It was impossible to deny that it was\nthrilling. His friend was right, it did seem silly to leave Monte\nwithout putting something on the table just once. It would be an\nexperience, and at his age you had to have all the experience you could\nget. He reflected that he hadn't promised his father not to gamble, he'd\npromised him not to forget his advice. It wasn't quite the same, was it?\nHe took a hundred-franc note out of his pocket and rather shyly put it\non number eighteen. He chose it because that was his age. With a wildly\nbeating heart he watched the wheel turn; the little white ball whizzed\nabout like a small demon of mischief; the wheel went round more slowly,\nthe little white ball hesitated, it seemed about to stop, it went on\nagain; Nicky could hardly believe his eyes when it fell into number\neighteen. A lot of chips were passed over to him and his hands trembled\nas he took them. It seemed to amount to a lot of money. He was so\nconfused that he never thought of putting anything on the following\nround; in fact he had no intention of playing any more, once was enough;\nand he was surprised when eighteen again came up. There was only one\nchip on it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By George, you've won again,\" said a man who was standing near to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Me? I hadn't got anything on.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, you had. Your original stake. They always leave it on unless you\nask for it back. Didn't you know?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnother packet of chips was handed over to him. Nicky's head reeled. He\ncounted his gains: seven thousand francs. A queer sense of power seized\nhim; he felt wonderfully clever. This was the easiest way of making\nmoney that he had ever heard of. His frank, charming face was wreathed\nin smiles. His bright eyes met those of a woman standing by his side.\nShe smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're in luck,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe spoke English, but with a foreign accent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can hardly believe it. It's the first time I've ever played.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That explains it. Lend me a thousand francs, will you? I've lost\neverything I've got. I'll give it you back in half an hour.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe took a large red chip from his pile and with a word of thanks\ndisappeared. The man who had spoken to him before grunted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll never see that again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNicky was dashed. His father had particularly advised him not to lend\nanyone money. What a silly thing to do! And to somebody he'd never seen\nin his life. But the fact was, he felt at that moment such a love for\nthe human race that it had never occurred to him to refuse. And that big\nred chip, it was almost impossible to realise that it had any value. Oh\nwell, it didn't matter, he still had six thousand francs, he'd just try\nhis luck once or twice more and if he didn't win he'd go home. He put a\nchip on sixteen, which was his elder sister's age, but it didn't come\nup; then on twelve, which was his younger sister's, and that didn't come\nup either; he tried various numbers at random, but without success. It\nwas funny, he seemed to have lost his knack. He thought he would try\njust once more and then stop; he won. He had made up all his losses and\nhad something over. At the end of an hour, after various ups and downs,\nhaving experienced such thrills as he had never known in his life, he\nfound himself with so many chips that they would hardly go in his\npockets. He decided to go. He went to the changers' office and he gasped\nwhen twenty thousand-franc notes were spread out before him. He had\nnever had so much money in his life. He put it in his pocket and was\nturning away when the woman to whom he had lent the thousand francs came\nup to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've been looking for you everywhere,\" she said. \"I was afraid you'd\ngone. I was in a fever, I didn't know what you'd think of me. Here's\nyour thousand francs and thank you so much for the loan.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNicky, blushing scarlet, stared at her with amazement. How he had\nmisjudged her! His father had said, don't gamble; well, he had, and he'd\nmade twenty thousand francs; and his father had said, don't lend anyone\nmoney; well, he had, he'd lent quite a lot to a total stranger, and\nshe'd returned it. The fact was that he wasn't nearly such a fool as his\nfather thought: he'd had an instinct that he could lend her the money\nwith safety, and you see, his instinct was right. But he was so\nobviously taken aback that the little lady was forced to laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is the matter with you?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To tell you the truth I never expected to see the money back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did you take me for? Did you think I was a--cocotte?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNicky reddened to the roots of his wavy hair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, of course not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do I look like one?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not a bit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was dressed very quietly, in black, with a string of gold beads\nround her neck; her simple frock showed off a neat, slight figure; she\nhad a pretty little face and a trim head. She was made up, but not\nexcessively, and Nicky supposed that she was not more than three or four\nyears older than himself. She gave him a friendly smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My husband is in the administration in Morocco, and I've come to Monte\nCarlo for a few weeks because he thought I wanted a change.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was just going,\" said Nicky because he couldn't think of anything\nelse to say.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Already!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I've got to get up early to-morrow. I'm going back to London by\nair.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course. The tournament ended to-day, didn't it? I saw you play, you\nknow, two or three times.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you? I don't know why you should have noticed me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got a beautiful style. And you looked very sweet in your\nshorts.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNicky was not an immodest youth, but it did cross his mind that perhaps\nshe had borrowed that thousand francs in order to scrape acquaintance\nwith him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you ever go to the Knickerbocker?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. I never have.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, but you mustn't leave Monte Carlo without having been there. Why\ndon't you come and dance a little? To tell you the truth, I'm starving\nwith hunger and I should adore some bacon and eggs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNicky remembered his father's advice not to have anything to do with\nwomen, but this was different; you had only to look at the pretty little\nthing to know at once that she was perfectly respectable. Her husband\nwas in what corresponded, he supposed, to the Civil Service. His father\nand mother had friends who were Civil Servants and they and their wives\nsometimes came to dinner. It was true that the wives were neither so\nyoung nor so pretty as this one, but she was just as ladylike as they\nwere. And after winning twenty thousand francs he thought it wouldn't be\na bad idea to have a little fun.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd love to go with you,\" he said. \"But you won't mind if I don't stay\nvery long. I've left instructions at my hotel that I'm to be called at\nseven.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'll leave as soon as ever you like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNicky found it very pleasant at the Knickerbocker. He ate his bacon and\neggs with appetite. They shared a bottle of champagne. They danced, and\nthe little lady told him he danced beautifully. He knew he danced pretty\nwell, and of course she was easy to dance with. As light as a feather.\nShe laid her cheek against his and when their eyes met there was in hers\na smile that made his heart go pit-a-pat. A coloured woman sang in a\nthroaty, sensual voice. The floor was crowded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you ever been told that you're very good-looking?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think so,\" he laughed. \"Gosh,\" he thought, \"I believe she's\nfallen for me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNicky was not such a fool as to be unaware that women often liked him,\nand when she made that remark he pressed her to him a little more\nclosely. She closed her eyes and a faint sigh escaped her lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose it wouldn't be quite nice if I kissed you before all these\npeople,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you think they would take me for?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt began to grow late and Nicky said that really he thought he ought to\nbe going.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall go too,\" she said. \"Will you drop me at my hotel on your way?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNicky paid the bill. He was rather surprised at its amount, but with all\nthat money he had in his pocket he could afford not to care, and they\ngot into a taxi. She snuggled up to him and he kissed her. She seemed to\nlike it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By Jove,\" he thought, \"I wonder if there's anything doing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was true that she was a married woman, but her husband was in\nMorocco, and it certainly did look as if she'd fallen for him. Good and\nproper. It was true also that his father had warned him to have nothing\nto do with women, but, he reflected again, he hadn't actually promised\nhe wouldn't, he'd only promised not to forget his advice. Well, he\nhadn't; he was bearing it in mind that very minute. But circumstances\nalter cases. She was a sweet little thing; it seemed silly to miss the\nchance of an adventure when it was handed to you like that on a tray.\nWhen they reached the hotel he paid off the taxi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll walk home,\" he said. \"The air will do me good after the stuffy\natmosphere of that place.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come up a moment,\" she said. \"I'd like to show you the photo of my\nlittle boy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, have you got a little boy?\" he exclaimed, a trifle dashed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, a sweet little boy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe walked upstairs after her. He didn't in the least want to see the\nphotograph of her little boy, but he thought it only civil to pretend he\ndid. He was afraid he'd made a fool of himself; it occurred to him that\nshe was taking him up to look at the photograph in order to show him in\na nice way that he'd made a mistake. He'd told her he was eighteen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose she thinks I'm just a kid.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe began to wish he hadn't spent all that money on champagne at the\nnight-club.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut she didn't show him the photograph of her little boy after all. They\nhad no sooner got into her room than she turned to him, flung her arms\nround his neck, and kissed him full on the lips. He had never in all his\nlife been kissed so passionately.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Darling,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a brief moment his father's advice once more crossed Nicky's mind\nand then he forgot it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n****\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNicky was a light sleeper and the least sound was apt to wake him. Two\nor three hours later he awoke and for a moment could not imagine where\nhe was. The room was not quite dark, for the door of the bathroom was\najar, and the light in it had been left on. Suddenly he was conscious\nthat someone was moving about the room. Then he remembered. He saw that\nit was his little friend, and he was on the point of speaking when\nsomething in the way she was behaving stopped him. She was walking very\ncautiously, as though she were afraid of waking him; she stopped once or\ntwice and looked over at the bed. He wondered what she was after. He\nsoon saw. She went over to the chair on which he had placed his clothes\nand once more looked in his direction. She waited for what seemed to him\nan interminable time. The silence was so intense that Nicky thought he\ncould hear his own heart beating. Then, very slowly, very quietly, she\ntook up his coat, slipped her hand into the inside pocket and drew out\nall those beautiful thousand-franc notes that Nicky had been so proud to\nwin. She put the coat back and placed some other clothes on it so that\nit should look as though it had not been disturbed, then, with the\nbundle of notes in her hand, for an appreciable time stood once more\nstock-still. Nicky had repressed an instinctive impulse to jump up and\ngrab her, it was partly surprise that had kept him quiet, partly the\nnotion that he was in a strange hotel, in a foreign country, and if he\nmade a row he didn't know what might happen. She looked at him. His eyes\nwere partly closed and he was sure that she thought he was asleep. In\nthe silence she could hardly fail to hear his regular breathing. When\nshe had reassured herself that her movements had not disturbed him she\nstepped, with infinite caution, across the room. On a small table in the\nwindow a cineraria was growing in a pot. Nicky watched her now with his\neyes wide open. The plant was evidently placed quite loosely in the pot,\nfor taking it by the stalks she lifted it out; she put the banknotes in\nthe bottom of the pot and replaced the plant. It was an excellent\nhiding-place. No one could have guessed that anything was concealed\nunder that richly-flowering plant. She pressed the earth down with her\nfingers and then, very slowly, taking care not to make the smallest\nnoise, crept across the room, and slipped back into bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Chéri,\" she said, in a caressing voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNicky breathed steadily, like a man immersed in deep sleep. The little\nlady turned over on her side and disposed herself to slumber. But though\nNicky lay so still his thoughts worked busily. He was extremely\nindignant at the scene he had just witnessed, and to himself he spoke\nhis thoughts with vigour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's nothing but a damned tart. She and her dear little boy and her\nhusband in Morocco. My eye! She's a rotten thief, that's what she is.\nTook me for a mug. If she thinks she's going to get away with anything\nlike that, she's mistaken.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had already made up his mind what he was going to do with the money\nhe had so cleverly won. He had long wanted a car of his own, and had\nthought it rather mean of his father not to have given him one. After\nall, a feller doesn't always want to drive about in the family bus.\nWell, he'd just teach the old man a lesson and buy one himself. For\ntwenty thousand francs, two hundred pounds roughly, he could get a very\ndecent second-hand car. He meant to get the money back, but just then he\ndidn't quite know how. He didn't like the idea of kicking up a row, he\nwas a stranger, in an hotel he knew nothing of; it might very well be\nthat the beastly woman had friends there, he didn't mind facing anyone\nin a fair fight, but he'd look pretty foolish if someone pulled a gun on\nhim. He reflected besides, very sensibly, that he had no proof the money\nwas his. If it came to a showdown and she swore it was hers, he might\nvery easily find himself hauled off to a police-station. He really\ndidn't know what to do. Presently by her regular breathing he knew that\nthe little lady was asleep. She must have fallen asleep with an easy\nmind, for she had done her job without a hitch. It infuriated Nicky that\nshe should rest so peacefully while he lay awake worried to death.\nSuddenly an idea occurred to him. It was such a good one that it was\nonly by the exercise of all his self-control that he prevented himself\nfrom jumping out of bed and carrying it out at once. Two could play at\nher game. She'd stolen his money; well, he'd steal it back again, and\nthey'd be all square. He made up his mind to wait quite quietly until he\nwas sure that deceitful woman was sound asleep. He waited for what\nseemed to him a very long time. She did not stir. Her breathing was as\nregular as a child's.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Darling,\" he said at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNo answer. No movement. She was dead to the world. Very slowly, pausing\nafter every movement, very silently, he slipped out of bed. He stood\nstill for a while, looking at her to see whether he had disturbed her.\nHer breathing was as regular as before. During the time he was waiting\nhe had taken note carefully of the furniture in the room so that in\ncrossing it he should not knock against a chair or a table and make a\nnoise. He took a couple of steps and waited, he took a couple of steps\nmore; he was very light on his feet and made no sound as he walked; he\ntook fully five minutes to get to the window, and here he waited again.\nHe started, for the bed slightly creaked, but it was only because the\nsleeper turned in her sleep. He forced himself to wait till he had\ncounted one hundred. She was sleeping like a log. With infinite care he\nseized the cineraria by the stalks and gently pulled it out of the pot;\nhe put his other hand in, his heart beat nineteen to the dozen as his\nfingers touched the notes, his hand closed on them and he slowly drew\nthem out. He replaced the plant and in his turn carefully pressed down\nthe earth. While he was doing all this he had kept one eye on the form\nlying in the bed. It remained still. After another pause he crept softly\nto the chair on which his clothes were lying. He first put the bundle of\nnotes in his coat pocket and then proceeded to dress. It took him a good\nquarter of an hour, because he could afford to make no sound. He had\nbeen wearing a soft shirt with his dinner jacket, and he congratulated\nhimself on this, because it was easier to put on silently than a stiff\none. He had some difficulty in tying his tie without a looking-glass,\nbut he very wisely reflected that it didn't really matter if it wasn't\ntied very well. His spirits were rising. The whole thing now began to\nseem rather a lark. At length he was completely dressed except for his\nshoes, which he took in his hand; he thought he would put them on when\nhe got into the passage. Now he had to cross the room to get to the\ndoor. He reached it so quietly that he could not have disturbed the\nlightest sleeper. But the door had to be unlocked. He turned the key\nvery slowly; it creaked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who's that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe little woman suddenly sat up in bed. Nicky's heart jumped to his\nmouth. He made a great effort to keep his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's only me. It's six o'clock and I've got to go. I was trying not to\nwake you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I forgot.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe sank back on to the pillow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now that you're awake I'll put on my shoes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sat down on the edge of the bed and did this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't make a noise when you go out. The hotel people don't like it. Oh,\nI'm so sleepy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You go right off to sleep again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Kiss me before you go.\" He bent down and kissed her. \"You're a sweet\nboy and a wonderful lover. <i>Bon voyage.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNicky did not feel quite safe till he got out of the hotel. The dawn had\nbroken. The sky was unclouded, and in the harbour the yachts and the\nfishing-boats lay motionless on the still water. On the quay fishermen\nwere getting ready to start on their day's work. The streets were\ndeserted. Nicky took a long breath of the sweet morning air. He felt\nalert and well. He also felt as pleased as Punch. With a swinging\nstride, his shoulders well thrown back, he walked up the hill and along\nthe gardens in front of the Casino--the flowers in that clear light had\na dewy brilliance that was delicious--till he came to his hotel. Here\nthe day had already begun. In the hall porters with mufflers round their\nnecks and berets on their heads were busy sweeping. Nicky went up to his\nroom and had a hot bath. He lay in it and thought with satisfaction that\nhe was not such a mug as some people might think. After his bath he did\nhis exercises, dressed, packed and went down to breakfast. He had a\ngrand appetite. No continental breakfast for him! He had grape-fruit,\nporridge, bacon and eggs, rolls fresh from the oven, so crisp and\ndelicious they melted in your mouth, marmalade and three cups of coffee.\nThough feeling perfectly well before, he felt better after that. He lit\nthe pipe he had recently learnt to smoke, paid his bill and stepped into\nthe car that was waiting to take him to the aerodrome on the other side\nof Cannes. The road as far as Nice ran over the hills and below him was\nthe blue sea and the coast-line. He couldn't help thinking it damned\npretty. They passed through Nice, so gay and friendly in the early\nmorning, and presently they came to a long stretch of straight road that\nran by the sea. Nicky had paid his bill, not with the money he had won\nthe night before, but with the money his father had given him; he had\nchanged a thousand francs to pay for supper at the Knickerbocker, but\nthat deceitful little woman had returned him the thousand francs he had\nlent her, so that he still had twenty thousand-franc notes in his\npocket. He thought he would like to have a look at them. He had so\nnearly lost them that they had a double value for him. He took them out\nof his hip-pocket into which for safety's sake he had stuffed them when\nhe put on the suit he was travelling in, and counted them one by one.\nSomething very strange had happened to them. Instead of there being\ntwenty notes as there should have been there were twenty-six. He\ncouldn't understand it at all. He counted them twice more. There was no\ndoubt about it; somehow or other he had twenty-six thousand francs\ninstead of the twenty be should have had. He couldn't make it out. He\nasked himself if it was possible that he had won more at the Sporting\nClub than he had realised. But no, that was out of the question; he\ndistinctly remembered the man at the desk laying the notes out in four\nrows of five, and he had counted them himself. Suddenly the explanation\noccurred to him; when he had put his hand into the flower-pot, after\ntaking out the cineraria, he had grabbed everything he felt there. The\nflower-pot was the little hussy's money-box and he had taken out not\nonly his own money, but her savings as well. Nicky leant back in the car\nand burst into a roar of laughter. It was the funniest thing he had ever\nheard in his life. And when he thought of her going to the flower-pot\nsome time later in the morning when she awoke, expecting to find the\nmoney she had so cleverly got away with, and finding, not only that it\nwasn't there, but that her own had gone too, he laughed more than ever.\nAnd so far as he was concerned there was nothing to do about it; he\nneither knew her name, nor the name of the hotel to which she had taken\nhim. He couldn't return her money even if he wanted to.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It serves her damned well right,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n****\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis then was the story that Henry Garnet told his friends over the\nbridge-table, for the night before, after dinner when his wife and\ndaughter had left them to their port, Nicky had narrated it in full.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And you know what infuriated me is that he's so damned pleased with\nhimself. Talk of a cat swallowing a canary. And d'you know what he said\nto me when he'd finished? He looked at me with those innocent eyes of\nhis and said: 'You know, father, I can't help thinking there was\nsomething wrong about the advice you gave me. You said, don't gamble;\nwell, I did, and I made a packet; you said, don't lend money; well, I\ndid, and I got it back; and you said, don't have anything to do with\nwomen; well, I did, and I made six thousand francs on the deal.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt didn't make it any better for Henry Garnet that his three companions\nburst out laughing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's all very well for you fellows to laugh, but you know, I'm in a\ndamned awkward position. The boy looked up to me, he respected me, he\ntook whatever I said as gospel truth, and now, I saw it in his eyes, he\njust looks upon me as a drivelling old fool. It's no good my saying one\nswallow doesn't make a summer; he doesn't see that it was just a fluke,\nhe thinks the whole thing was due to his own cleverness. It may ruin\nhim.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You do look a bit of a damned fool, old man,\" said one of the others.\n\"There's no denying that, is there?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know I do, and I don't like it. It's so dashed unfair. Fate has no\nright to play one tricks like that. After all, you must admit that my\nadvice was good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And the wretched boy ought to have burnt his fingers. Well, he hasn't.\nYou're all men of the world, you tell me how I'm to deal with the\nsituation now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut they none of them could.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Henry, if I were you I wouldn't worry,\" said the lawyer. \"My\nbelief is that your boy's born lucky, and in the long run that's better\nthan to be born clever or rich.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThe bar was crowded. Sandy Westcott had had a couple of cocktails and he\nwas beginning to feel hungry. He looked at his watch. He had been asked\nto dinner at half-past nine and it was nearly ten. Eva Barrett was\nalways late and he would be lucky if he got anything to eat by\nten-thirty. He turned to the barman to order another cocktail and caught\nsight of a man who at that moment came up to the bar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hullo, Cotman,\" he said. \"Have a drink?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't mind if I do, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCotman was a nice-looking fellow, of thirty perhaps, short, but with so\ngood a figure that he did not look it, very smartly dressed in a\ndouble-breasted dinner jacket, a little too much waisted, and a\nbutterfly tie a good deal too large. He had a thick mat of black, wavy\nhair, very sleek and shiny, brushed straight back from his forehead, and\nlarge flashing eyes. He spoke with great refinement, but with a Cockney\naccent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How's Stella?\" asked Sandy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, she's all right. Likes to have a lay-down before the show, you\nknow. Steadies the old nerves, she says.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't do that stunt of hers for a thousand pounds.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't suppose you would. No one can do it but her, not from that\nheight, I mean, and only five foot of water.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's the most sick-making thing I've ever seen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCotman gave a little laugh. He took this as a compliment. Stella was his\nwife. Of course she did the trick and took the risk, but it was he who\nhad thought of the flames, and it was the flames that had taken the\npublic fancy and made the turn the huge success it was. Stella dived\ninto a tank from the top of a ladder sixty feet high, and as he said,\nthere were only five feet of water in the tank. Just before she dived\nthey poured enough petrol on to cover the surface and he set it alight;\nthe flames soared up and she dived straight into them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Paco Espinel tells me it's the biggest draw the Casino has ever had,\"\nsaid Sandy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know. He told me they'd served as many dinners in July as they\ngenerally do in August. And that's you, he says to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I hope you're making a packet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I can't exactly say that. You see, we've got our contract and\nnaturally we didn't know it was going to be a riot, but Mr. Espinel's\ntalking of booking us for next month, and I don't mind telling you he's\nnot going to get us on the same terms or anything like it. Why, I had a\nletter from an agent only this morning saying they wanted us to go to\nDeauville.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Here are my people,\" said Sandy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe nodded to Cotman and left him. Eva Barrett sailed in with the rest of\nher guests. She had gathered them together downstairs. It was a party of\neight.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I knew we should find you here, Sandy,\" she said. \"I'm not late, am I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Only half an hour.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ask them what cocktails they want and then we'll dine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhile they were standing at the bar, emptying now, for nearly everyone\nhad gone down to the terrace for dinner, Paco Espinel passed through and\nstopped to shake hands with Eva Barrett. Paco Espinel was a young man\nwho had run through his money and now made his living by arranging the\nturns with which the Casino sought to attract visitors. It was his duty\nto be civil to the rich and great. Mrs. Chaloner Barrett was an American\nwidow of vast wealth; she not only entertained expensively, but also\ngambled. And after all, the dinners and suppers and the two cabaret\nshows that accompanied them were only provided to induce people to lose\ntheir money at the tables.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Got a good table for me, Paco?\" said Eva Barrett.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The best.\" His eyes, fine, dark Argentine eyes, expressed his\nadmiration of Mrs. Barrett's opulent, ageing charms. This also was\nbusiness. \"You've seen Stella?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course. Three times. It's the most terrifying thing I've ever seen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sandy comes every night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want to be in at the death. She's bound to kill herself one of these\nnights and I don't want to miss that if I can help it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPaco laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's been such a success, we're going to keep her on another month.\nAll I ask is that she shouldn't kill herself till the end of August.\nAfter that she can do as she likes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, God, have I got to go on eating trout and roast chicken every night\ntill the end of August?\" cried Sandy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You brute, Sandy,\" said Eva Barrett. \"Come on, let's go in to dinner.\nI'm starving.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPaco Espinel asked the barman if he'd seen Cotman. The barman said he'd\nhad a drink with Mr. Westcott.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, well, if he comes in here again, tell him I want a word with him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Barrett paused at the top of the steps that led down to the terrace\nlong enough for the Press representative, a little haggard woman with an\nuntidy head, to come up with her note-book. Sandy whispered the names of\nthe guests. It was a representative Riviera party. There was an English\nLord and his Lady, long and lean both of them, who were prepared to dine\nwith anyone who would give them a free meal. They were certain to be as\ntight as drums before midnight. There was a gaunt Scotch woman, with a\nface like a Peruvian mask that has been battered by the storms of ten\ncenturies, and her English husband. Though a broker by profession, he\nwas bluff, military and hearty. He gave you an impression of such\nintegrity that you were almost more sorry for him than for yourself when\nthe good thing he had put you on to as a special favour turned out to be\na dud. There was an Italian countess who was neither Italian nor a\ncountess, but played a beautiful game of bridge, and there was a Russian\nprince who was ready to make Mrs. Barrett a princess and in the meantime\nsold champagne, motor-cars and Old Masters on commission. A dance was in\nprogress and Mrs. Barrett, waiting for it to end, surveyed with a look\nwhich her short upper lip made scornful the serried throng on the dance\nfloor. It was a gala night and the dining tables were crowded together.\nBeyond the terrace the sea was calm and silent. The music stopped and\nthe head waiter, affably smiling, came up to guide her to her table. She\nswept down the steps with majestic gait.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We shall have quite a good view of the dive,\" she said as she sat down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I like to be next door to the tank,\" said Sandy, \"so that I can see her\nface.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is she pretty?\" asked the Countess.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not that. It's the expression of her eyes. She's scared to death\nevery time she does it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I don't believe that,\" said the City gentleman, Colonel Goodhart by\nname, though no one had ever discovered how he came by the title. \"I\nmean, the whole bally stunt's only a trick. There's no danger really, I\nmean.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't know what you're talking about. Diving from that height in as\nlittle water as that, she's got to turn like a flash the moment she\ntouches the water. And if she doesn't do it right she's bound to bash\nher head against the bottom and break her back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's just what I'm telling you, old boy,\" said the Colonel, \"it's a\ntrick. I mean, there's no argument.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If there's no danger there's nothing to it, anyway,\" said Eva Barrett.\n\"It's over in a minute. Unless she's risking her life it's the biggest\nfraud of modern times. Don't say we've come to see this over and over\nagain and it's only a fake.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pretty well everything is. You can take my word for that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you ought to know,\" said Sandy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIf it occurred to the Colonel that this might be a nasty dig he\nadmirably concealed it. He laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't mind saying I know a thing or two,\" he admitted. \"I mean, I've\ngot my eyes peeled all right. You can't put much over on me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe tank was on the far left of the terrace, and behind it, supported by\nstays, was an immensely tall ladder at the top of which was a tiny\nplatform. After two or three dances more, when Eva Barrett's party were\neating asparagus, the music stopped and the lights were lowered. A spot\nwas turned on the tank, Cotman was visible in the brilliance. He\nascended half a dozen steps so that he was on a level with the top of\nthe tank.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he cried out, in a loud clear voice, \"you are\nnow going to see the most marvellous feat of the century. Madam Stella,\nthe greatest diver in the world, is about to dive from a height of sixty\nfeet into a lake of flames five foot deep. This is a feat that has never\nbeen performed before, and Madam Stella is prepared to give one hundred\npounds to anyone who will attempt it. Ladies and gentlemen, I have the\nhonour to present Madam Stella.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA little figure appeared at the top of the steps that led on to the\nterrace, ran quickly up to the tank, and bowed to the applauding\naudience. She wore a man's silk dressing-gown and on her head a\nbathing-cap. Her thin face was made up as if for the stage. The Italian\ncountess looked at her through her <i>face-à-main</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not pretty,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good figure,\" said Eva Barrett. \"You'll see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nStella slipped out of her dressing-gown and gave it to Cotman. He went\ndown the steps. She stood for a moment and looked at the crowd. They\nwere in darkness and she could only see vague white faces and white\nshirt-fronts. She was small, beautifully made, with legs long for her\nbody and slim hips. Her bathing costume was very scanty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're quite right about the figure, Eva,\" said the Colonel. \"Bit\nundeveloped, of course, but I know you girls think that's quite the\nthing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nStella began to climb the ladder and the spot-light followed her. It\nseemed an incredible height. An attendant poured petrol on the surface\nof the water. Cotman was handed a flaming torch. He watched Stella reach\nthe top of the ladder and settle herself on the platform.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ready?\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go,\" he shouted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd as he shouted he seemed to plunge the burning torch into the water.\nThe flames sprang up, leaping high, and really terrifying to look at. At\nthe same moment Stella dived. She came down like a streak of lightning\nand plunged through the flames, which subsided a moment after she had\nreached the water. A second later she was at the surface and jumped out\nto a roar, a storm of applause. Cotman wrapped the dressing-gown round\nher. She bowed and bowed. The applause went on. Music struck up. With a\nfinal wave of the hand she ran down the steps and between the tables to\nthe door. The lights went up and the waiters hurried along with their\nneglected service.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSandy Westcott gave a sigh. He did not know whether he was disappointed\nor relieved.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Top hole,\" said the English peer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a bally fake,\" said the Colonel, with his British pertinacity.\n\"I'll bet you anything you like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's over so quickly,\" said her English ladyship, \"I mean, you don't\nget your money's worth really.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnyhow it wasn't her money. That it never was. The Italian countess\nleaned forward. She spoke fluent English, but with a strong accent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Eva, my darling, who are those extraordinary people at the table near\nthe door under the balcony?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Packet of fun, aren't they?\" said Sandy. \"I simply haven't been able to\ntake my eyes off them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEva Barrett glanced at the table the Countess indicated, and the Prince,\nwho sat with his back to it, turned round to look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They can't be true,\" cried Eva. \"I must ask Angelo who they are.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Barrett was the sort of woman who knew the head waiters of all the\nprincipal restaurants in Europe by their first names. She told the\nwaiter who was at that moment filling her glass to send Angelo to her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was certainly an odd pair. They were sitting by themselves at a small\ntable. They were very old. The man was big and stout, with a mass of\nwhite hair, great bushy white eyebrows and an enormous white moustache.\nHe looked like the late King Humbert of Italy, but much more like a\nking. He sat bolt upright. He wore full evening dress, with a white tie\nand a collar that has been out of fashion for hard on thirty years. His\ncompanion was a little old lady in a black satin ball dress, cut very\nlow and tight at the waist. Round her neck were several chains of\ncoloured beads. She wore what was obviously a wig, and a very\nill-fitting one at that; it was very elaborate, all curls and sausages,\nand raven black. She was outrageously made-up, bright blue under the\neyes and on the eyelids, the eyebrows heavily black, a great patch of\nvery pink rouge on each cheek and the lips a livid scarlet. The skin\nhung loosely on her face in deep wrinkles. She had large bold eyes and\nthey darted eagerly from table to table. She was taking everything in,\nand every other minute called the old man's attention to someone or\nother. The appearance of the couple was so fantastic in that fashionable\ncrowd, the men in dinner jackets, the women in thin, pale-coloured\nfrocks, that many eyes were turned on them. The staring did not seem to\nincommode the old lady. When she felt certain persons were looking at\nher she raised her eyebrows archly, smiled and rolled her eyes. She\nseemed on the point of acknowledging applause.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAngelo hurried up to the good customer that Eva Barrett was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You wished to see me, my lady?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Angelo, we're simply dying to know who those absolutely marvellous\npeople are at the next table to the door.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAngelo gave a look and then assumed a deprecating air. The expression of\nhis face, the movement of his shoulders, the turn of his spine, the\ngesture of his hands, probably even the twiddle of his toes, all\nindicated a half-humorous apology.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must overlook them, my lady.\" He knew of course that Mrs. Barrett\nhad no right to be thus addressed, just as he knew that the Italian\ncountess was neither Italian nor a countess and that the English lord\nnever paid for a drink if anyone else would pay for it, but he also knew\nthat to be thus addressed did not displease her. \"They begged me to give\nthem a table because they wanted to see Madame Stella do her dive. They\nwere in the profession themselves once. I know they're not the sort of\npeople one expects to see dining here, but they made such a point of it\nI simply hadn't the heart to refuse.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I think they're a perfect scream. I adore them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've known them for many years. The man indeed is a compatriot of\nmine.\" The head waiter gave a condescending little laugh. \"I told them\nI'd give them a table on the condition that they didn't dance. I wasn't\ntaking any risks, my lady.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, but I should have loved to see them dance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One has to draw the line somewhere, my lady,\" said Angelo gravely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe smiled, bowed again and withdrew.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look,\" cried Sandy, \"they're going.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe funny old couple were paying their bill. The old man got up and put\nround his wife's neck a large white, but not too clean, feather boa. She\nrose. He gave her his arm, holding himself very erect, and she, small in\ncomparison, tripped out beside him. Her black satin dress had a long\ntrain, and Eva Barrett (who was well over fifty) screamed with joy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look, I remember my mother wearing a dress like that when I was in the\nschool-room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe comic pair walked, still arm in arm, through the spacious rooms of\nthe Casino till they came to the door. The old man addressed a\ncommissionaire.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Be so good as to direct me to the artistes' dressing-rooms. We wish to\npay our respects to Madame Stella.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe commissionaire gave them a look and summed them up. They were not\npeople with whom it was necessary to be very polite.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You won't find her there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She has not gone? I thought she gave a second performance at two?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's true. They might be in the bar.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It won't 'urt us just to go an' 'ave a look, Carlo,\" said the old lady.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Right-o, my love,\" he answered with a great roll of the R.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey walked slowly up the great stairs and entered the bar. It was empty\nbut for the deputy-barman and a couple sitting in two arm-chairs in the\ncorner. The old lady released her husband's arm and tripped up with\noutstretched hands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Ow are you, dear? I felt I just 'ad to come and congratulate you,\nbein' English same as you are. And in the profession meself. It's a\ngrand turn, my dear, it deserves to be a success.\" She turned to Cotman.\n\"And this is your 'usband?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nStella got out of her arm-chair and a shy smile broke on her lips as she\nlistened with some confusion to the voluble old lady.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, that's Syd.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And this is mine,\" said the old lady, with a little dig of the elbow in\nthe direction of the tall white-haired man. \"Mr. Penezzi. 'E's a count\nreally, and I'm the Countess Penezzi by rights, but when we retired from\nthe profession we dropped the title.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you have a drink?\" said Cotman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, you 'ave one with us,\" said Mrs. Penezzi, sinking into an\narm-chair. \"Carlo, you order.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe barman came, and after some discussion three bottles of beer were\nordered. Stella would not have anything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She never has anything till after the second show,\" explained Cotman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nStella was slight and small, about twenty-six, with light brown hair,\ncut short and waved, and grey eyes. She had reddened her lips, but wore\nlittle rouge on her face. Her skin was pale. She was not very pretty,\nbut she had a neat little face. She wore a very simple evening frock of\nwhite silk. The beer was brought and Mr. Penezzi, evidently not very\ntalkative, took a long swig.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What was your line?\" asked Syd Cotman, politely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Penezzi gave him a rolling glance of her flashing, made-up eyes and\nturned to her husband.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell 'em who I am, Carlo,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The 'uman cannon-ball,\" he announced.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Penezzi smiled brightly and with a quick, birdlike glance looked\nfrom one to the other. They stared at her in dismay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Flora,\" she said. \"The 'uman cannon-ball.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe so obviously expected them to be impressed that they did not quite\nknow what to do. Stella gave her Syd a puzzled look. He came to her\nrescue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must have been before our time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Naturally it was before your time. Why, we retired from the profession\ndefinitely the year poor Queen Victoria died. It made quite a sensation\nwhen we did too. But you've 'eard of me, of course.\" She saw the blank\nlook on their faces; her tone changed a little. \"But I was the biggest\ndraw in London. At the Old Aquarium, that was. All the swells came to\nsee me. The Prince of Wales and I don't know who all. I was the talk of\nthe town. Isn't that true, Carlo?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She crowded the Aquarium for a year.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was the most spectacular turn they'd ever 'ad there. Why, only a few\nyears ago I went up and introduced meself to Lady de Bathe. Lily\nLangtry, you know. She used to live down 'ere. She remembered me\nperfectly. She told me she'd seen me ten times.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did you do?\" asked Stella.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was fired out of a cannon. Believe me, it was a sensation. And after\nLondon I went all over the world with it. Yes, my dear, I'm an old woman\nnow and I won't deny it. Seventy-eight Mr. Penezzi is and I shall never\nsee seventy again, but I've 'ad me portrait on every 'oardin' in London.\nLady de Bathe said to me: My dear, you was as celebrated as I was. But\nyou know what the public is, give 'em a good thing and they go mad over\nit, only they want change; 'owever good it is, they get sick of it and\nthen they won't go and see it any more. It'll 'appen to you, my dear,\nsame as it 'appened to me. It comes to all of us. But Mr. Penezzi always\n'ad 'is 'ead screwed on 'is shoulders the right way. Been in the\nbusiness since 'e was so 'igh. Circus, you know. Ringmaster. That's 'ow\nI first knew 'im. I was in a troupe of acrobacks. Trapeze act, you know.\n'E's a fine-lookin' man now, but you should 'ave seen 'im then, in 'is\nRussian boots, and ridin' breeches, and a tight-fittin' coat with frogs\nall down the front of it, crackin' 'is long whip as 'is 'orses galloped\nround the ring, the 'andsomest man I ever see in my life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Penezzi did not make any remark, but thoughtfully twisted his\nimmense white moustache.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, as I was tellin' you, 'e was never one to throw money about and\nwhen the agents couldn't get us bookin's any more 'e said, let's retire.\nAn 'e was quite right, after 'avin' been the biggest star in London, we\ncouldn't go back to circus work any more, I mean, Mr. Penezzi bein' a\ncount really, 'e 'ad 'is dignity to think of, so we come down 'ere and\nwe bought a 'ouse and started a pension. It always 'ad been Mr.\nPenezzi's ambition to do something like that. Thirty-five years we been\n'ere now. We 'aven't done so badly not until the last two or three\nyears, and the slump came, though visitors are very different from what\nthey was when we first started, the things they want, electric-light and\nrunnin' water in their bedrooms and I don't know what all. Give them a\ncard, Carlo. Mr. Penezzi does the cookin' 'imself, and if ever you want\na real 'ome from 'ome, you'll know where to find it. I like professional\npeople and we'd 'ave a rare lot to talk about, you and me, dearie. Once\na professional always a professional, I say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment the head barman came back from his supper. He caught\nsight of Syd.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Mr. Cotman, Mr. Espinel was looking for you, wants to see you\nparticularly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, where is he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll find him around somewhere.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'll be going,\" said Mrs. Penezzi, getting up. \"Come and 'ave lunch\nwith us one day, will you? I'd like to show you my old photographs and\nme press cuttin's. Fancy you not 'avin' 'eard of the 'uman cannon-ball.\nWhy, I was as well known as the Tower of London.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Penezzi was not vexed at finding that these young people had never\neven heard of her. She was simply amused.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey bade one another good-bye, and Stella sank back again into her\nchair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll just finish my beer,\" said Syd, \"and then I'll go and see what\nPaco wants. Will you stay here, ducky, or would you like to go to your\ndressing-room?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nStella's hands were tightly clenched. She did not answer. Syd gave her a\nlook and then quickly glanced away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perfect riot, that old girl,\" he went on, in his hearty way. \"Real\nfigure of fun. I suppose it's true what she said. It's difficult to\nbelieve, I must say. Fancy 'er drawing all London, what, forty year ago?\nAnd the funny thing is, her thinking anybody remembered. Seemed as\nthough she simply couldn't understand us not having heard of her even.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave Stella another glance, from the corner of his eye so that she\nshould not see he was looking at her, and he saw she was crying. He\nfaltered. The tears were rolling down her pale face. She made no sound.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's the matter, darling?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Syd, I can't do it again to-night,\" she sobbed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why on earth not?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took her hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know you better than that,\" he said. \"You're the bravest little woman\nin the world. Have a brandy, that'll pull you together.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, that'd only make it worse.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't disappoint your public like that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That filthy public. Swine who eat too much and drink too much. A pack\nof chattering fools with more money than they know what to do with. I\ncan't stick them. What do they care if I risk my life?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course, it's the thrill they come for, there's no denying that,\" he\nreplied uneasily. \"But you know and I know, there's no risk, not if you\nkeep your nerve.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I've lost my nerve, Syd. I shall kill myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe had raised her voice a little, and he looked round quickly at the\nbarman. But the barman was reading the <i>Éclaireur de Nice</i> and paying no\nattention.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't know what it looks like from up there, the top of the ladder,\nwhen I look down at the tank. I give you my word, to-night I thought I\nwas going to faint. I tell you I can't do it again to-night, you've got\nto get me out of it, Syd.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you funk it to-night it'll be worse to-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, it won't. It's having to do it twice kills me. The long wait and\nall that. You go and see Mr. Espinel and tell him I can't give two shows\na night. It's more than my nerves'll stand.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He'll never stand for that. The whole supper trade depends on you. It's\nonly to see you they come in then at all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't help it, I tell you I can't go on.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was silent for a moment. The tears still streamed down her pale\nlittle face, and he saw that she was quickly losing control of herself.\nHe had felt for some days that something was up and he had been anxious.\nHe had tried not to give her an opportunity to talk. He knew obscurely\nthat it was better for her not to put into words what she felt. But he\nhad been worried. For he loved her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Anyhow Espinel wants to see me,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What about?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. I'll tell him you can't give the show more than once a\nnight and see what he says. Will you wait here?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I'll go along to the dressing-room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTen minutes later he found her there. He was in great spirits and his\nstep was jaunty. He burst open the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got grand news for you, honey. They're keeping us on next month at\ntwice the money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sprang forward to take her in his arms and kiss her, but she pushed\nhim away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have I got to go on again to-night?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid you must. I tried to make it only one show a night, but he\nwouldn't hear of it. He says it's quite essential you should do the\nsupper turn. And after all, for double the money, it's worth it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe flung herself down on the floor and this time burst into a storm of\ntears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't, Syd, I can't. I shall kill myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sat down on the floor and raised her head and took her in his arms\nand petted her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Buck up, darling. You can't refuse a sum like that. Why, it'll keep us\nall the winter and we shan't have to do a thing. After all there are\nonly four more days to the end of July and then it's only August.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, no, no. I'm frightened. I don't want to die, Syd. I love you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know you do, darling, and I love you. Why, since we married I've\nnever looked at another woman. We've never had money like this before\nand we shall never get it again. You know what these things are, we're a\nriot now, but we can't expect it to go on for ever. We've got to strike\nwhile the iron's hot.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you want me to die, Syd?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't talk so silly. Why, where should I be without you? You mustn't\ngive way like this. You've got your self-respect to think of. You're\nfamous all over the world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Like the human cannon-ball was,\" she cried with a laugh of fury.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That damned old woman,\" he thought.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe knew that was the last straw. Bad luck, Stella taking it like that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That was an eye-opener to me,\" she went on. \"What do they come and see\nme over and over again for? On the chance they'll see me kill myself.\nAnd a week after I'm dead they'll have forgotten even my name. That's\nwhat the public is. When I looked at that painted old hag I saw it all.\nOh, Syd, I'm so miserable.\" She threw her arms round his neck and\npressed her face to his. \"Syd, it's no good, I can't do it again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To-night, d'you mean? If you really feel like that about it, I'll tell\nEspinel you've had a fainting fit. I daresay it'll be all right just for\nonce.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't mean to-night, I mean never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe felt him stiffen a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Syd dear, don't think I'm being silly. It's not just to-day, it's been\ngrowing on me. I can't sleep at night thinking of it, and when I do drop\noff I see myself standing at the top of the ladder and looking down.\nTo-night I could hardly get up it, I was trembling so, and when you lit\nthe flames and said go, something seemed to be holding me back. I didn't\neven know I'd jumped. My mind was a blank till I found myself on the\nplatform and heard them clapping. Syd, if you loved me you wouldn't want\nme to go through such torture.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sighed. His own eyes were wet with tears. For he loved her devotedly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know what it means,\" he said. \"The old life. Marathons and all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Anything's better than this.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe old life. They both remembered it. Syd had been a dancing gigolo\nsince he was eighteen, he was very good-looking in his dark Spanish way\nand full of life, old women and middle-aged women were glad to pay to\ndance with him, and he was never out of work. He had drifted from\nEngland to the Continent and there he had stayed, going from hotel to\nhotel, to the Riviera in the winter, to watering-places in France in the\nsummer. It wasn't a bad life they led, there were generally two or three\nof them together, the men, and they shared a room in cheap lodgings.\nThey didn't have to get up till late and they only dressed in time to go\nto the hotel at twelve to dance with stout women who wanted to get their\nweight down. Then they were free till five, when they went to the hotel\nagain and sat at a table, the three of them together, keeping a sharp\neye open for anyone who looked a likely client. They had their regular\ncustomers. At night they went to the restaurant and the house provided\nthem with quite a decent meal. Between the courses they danced. It was\ngood money. They generally got fifty or a hundred francs from anyone\nthey danced with. Sometimes a rich woman, after dancing a good deal with\none of them for two or three nights, would give him as much as a\nthousand francs. Sometimes a middle-aged woman would ask one to spend a\nnight with her, and he would get two hundred and fifty francs for that.\nThere was always the chance of a silly old fool losing her head, and\nthen there were platinum and sapphire rings, cigarette-cases, clothes\nand a wrist-watch to be got. One of Syd's friends had married one of\nthem, who was old enough to be his mother, but she gave him a car and\nmoney to gamble with, and they lived in a beautiful villa at Biarritz.\nThose were the good days when everybody had money to burn. The slump\ncame and hit the gigolos hard. The hotels were empty, and the clients\ndidn't seem to want to pay for the pleasure of dancing with a\nnice-looking young fellow. Often and often Syd passed a whole day\nwithout earning the price of a drink, and more than once a fat old girl\nwho weighed a ton had had the nerve to give him ten francs. His expenses\ndidn't go down, for he had to be smartly dressed or the manager of the\nhotel made remarks, washing cost a packet, and you'd be surprised the\namount of linen he needed; then shoes, those floors were terribly hard\non shoes, and they had to look new. He had his room to pay for and his\nlunch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was then he met Stella. It was at Evian, and the season was\ndisastrous. She was a swimming instructress. She was Australian, and a\nbeautiful diver. She gave exhibitions every morning and afternoon. At\nnight she was engaged to dance at the hotel. They dined together at a\nlittle table in the restaurant apart from the guests, and when the band\nbegan to play they danced together to induce the customers to come on to\nthe floor. But often no one followed them and they danced by themselves.\nNeither of them got anything much in the way of paying partners. They\nfell in love with one another, and at the end of the season got married.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey had never regretted it. They had gone through hard times. Even\nthough for business reasons (elderly ladies didn't so much like the idea\nof dancing with a married man when his wife was there) they concealed\ntheir marriage, it was not so easy to get an hotel job for the pair of\nthem and Syd was far from being able to earn enough to keep Stella, even\nin the most modest pension, without working. The gigolo business had\ngone to pot. They went to Paris and learnt a dancing act, but the\ncompetition was fearful and cabaret engagements were very hard to get.\nStella was a good ballroom dancer, but the rage was for acrobatics, and\nhowever much they practised she never managed to do anything startling.\nThe public was sick of the apache turn. They were out of a job for weeks\nat a time. Syd's wrist-watch, his gold cigarette-case, his platinum\nring, all went up the spout. At last they found themselves in Nice\nreduced to such straits that Syd had to pawn his evening clothes. It was\na catastrophe. They were forced to enter for the Marathon that an\nenterprising manager was starting. Twenty-four hours a day they danced,\nresting every hour for fifteen minutes. It was frightful. Their legs\nached, their feet were numb. For long periods they were unconscious of\nwhat they were doing. They just kept time to the music, exerting\nthemselves as little as possible. They made a little money, people gave\nthem sums of a hundred francs, or two hundred, to encourage them, and\nsometimes to attract attention they roused themselves to give an\nexhibition dance. If the public was in a good humour this might bring in\na decent sum. They grew terribly tired. On the eleventh day Stella\nfainted and had to give up. Syd went on by himself, moving, moving\nwithout pause, grotesquely, without a partner. That was the worst time\nthey had ever had. It was the final degradation. It had left with them a\nrecollection of horror and misery.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut it was then that Syd had his inspiration. It had come to him while\nhe was slowly going round the hall by himself. Stella always said she\ncould dive in a saucer. It was just a trick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Funny how ideas come,\" he said afterwards. \"Like a flash of lightning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe suddenly remembered having seen a boy set fire to some petrol that\nhad been spilt on the pavement, and the sudden blaze-up. For of course\nit was the flames on the water and the spectacular dive into them that\nhad caught the public fancy. He stopped dancing there and then; he was\ntoo excited to go on. He talked it over with Stella, and she was\nenthusiastic. He wrote to an agent who was a friend of his; everyone\nliked Syd, he was a nice little man, and the agent put up the money for\nthe apparatus. He got them an engagement at a circus in Paris, and the\nturn was a success. They were made. Engagements followed here and there,\nSyd bought himself an entire outfit of new clothes, and the climax came\nwhen they got a booking for the summer casino on the coast. It was no\nexaggeration of Syd's when he said that Stella was a riot.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All our troubles are over, old girl,\" he said fondly. \"We can put a bit\nby now for a rainy day, and when the public's sick of this I'll just\nthink of something else.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd now, without warning, at the top of their boom, Stella wanted to\nchuck it. He didn't know what to say to her. It broke his heart to see\nher so unhappy. He loved her more now even than when he had married her.\nHe loved her because of all they'd gone through together; after all, for\nfive days once they'd had nothing to eat but a hunk of bread each and a\nglass of milk, and he loved her because she'd taken him out of all that;\nhe had good clothes to wear again and his three meals a day. He couldn't\nlook at her; the anguish in her dear grey eyes was more than he could\nbear. Timidly she stretched out her hand and touched his. He gave a deep\nsigh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know what it means, honey. Our connection in the hotels has gone\nwest, and the business is finished, anyway. What there is'll go to\npeople younger than us. You know what these old women are as well as I\ndo; it's a boy they want, and besides, I'm not tall enough really. It\ndidn't matter so much when I was a kid. It's no good saying I don't look\nmy age because I do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps we can get into pictures.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe shrugged his shoulders. They'd tried that before when they were down\nand out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't mind what I did. I'd serve in a shop.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you think jobs can be had for the asking?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe began to cry again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't, honey. It breaks my heart.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We've got a bit put by.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know we have. Enough to last us six months. And then it'll mean\nstarvation. First popping the bits and pieces, and then the clothes'll\nhave to go, same as they did before. And then dancing in low-down joints\nfor our supper and fifty francs a night. Out of a job for weeks\ntogether. And Marathons whenever we hear of one. And how long will the\npublic stand for them?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know you think I'm unreasonable, Syd.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned and looked at her now. There were tears in her eyes. He\nsmiled, and the smile he gave her was charming and tender.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I don't, ducky. I want to make you happy. After all, you're all\nI've got. I love you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took her in his arms and held her. He could feel the beating of her\nheart. If Stella felt like that about it, well, he must just make the\nbest of it. After all, supposing she were killed? No, no, let her chuck\nit and be damned to the money. She made a little movement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it, honey?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe released herself and stood up. She went over to the dressing-table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I expect it's about time for me to be getting ready,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe started to his feet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not going to do a show to-night?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To-night, and every night till I kill myself. What else is there? I\nknow you're right, Syd. I can't go back to all that other, stinking\nrooms in fifth-rate hotels and not enough to eat. Oh, that Marathon. Why\ndid you bring that up? Being tired and dirty for days at a time and then\nhaving to give up because flesh and blood just couldn't stand it.\nPerhaps I can go on another month and then there'll be enough to give\nyou a chance of looking round.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, darling. I can't stand for that. Chuck it. We'll manage somehow. We\nstarved before; we can starve again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe slipped out of her clothes, and for a moment stood naked but for her\nstockings, looking at herself in the glass. She gave her reflection a\nhard smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I mustn't disappoint my public,\" she sniggered.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI don't know that I very much liked Landon. He was a member of a club I\nbelonged to, and I had often sat next to him at lunch. He was a judge at\nthe Old Bailey, and it was through him I was able to get a privileged\nseat in court when there was an interesting trial that I wanted to\nattend. He was an imposing figure on the bench in his great\nfull-bottomed wig, his red robes and his ermine tippet; and with his\nlong, white face, thin lips and pale blue eyes, a somewhat terrifying\none. He was just, but harsh; and sometimes it made me uncomfortable to\nhear the bitter scolding he gave a convicted prisoner whom he was about\nto sentence to a long term of imprisonment. But his acid humour at the\nlunch-table and his willingness to discuss the cases he had tried made\nhim sufficiently good company for me to disregard the slight malaise I\nfelt in his presence. I asked him once whether he did not feel a certain\nuneasiness of mind after he had sent a man to the gallows. He smiled as\nhe sipped his glass of port.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not at all. The man's had a fair trial; I've summed up as fairly as I\ncould, and the jury has found him guilty. When I condemn him to death, I\nsentence him to a punishment he richly deserves; and when the court\nrises, I put the case out of my head. Nobody but a sentimental fool\nwould do anything else.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI knew he liked to talk to me, but I never thought he looked upon me as\nanything but a club acquaintance, so I was not a little surprised when\none day I received a telegram from him saying that he was spending his\nvacation on the Riviera, and would like to stay with me for two or three\ndays on his way to Italy. I wired that I should be glad to see him. But\nit was with a certain trepidation that I met him at the station.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn the day of his arrival, to help me out, I asked Miss Gray, a\nneighbour and an old friend of mine, to dinner. She was of mature age,\nbut charming, and she had a flow of lively conversation which I knew\nnothing could discourage. I gave them a very good dinner, and though I\nhad no port to offer the judge, I was able to provide him with a good\nbottle of Montrachet and an even better bottle of Mouton Rothschild. He\nenjoyed them both; and I was glad of that, because when I had offered\nhim a cocktail, he had refused with indignation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have never understood,\" he said, \"how people presumably civilised can\nindulge in a habit that is not only barbarous but disgusting.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI may state that this did not deter Miss Gray and me from having a\ncouple of dry Martinis, though it was with impatience and distaste that\nhe watched us drink them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the dinner was a success. The good wine and Miss Gray's sprightly\nchatter combined to give Landon a geniality I had never before seen in\nhim. It was plain to me that notwithstanding his austere appearance he\nliked feminine society; and Miss Gray in a becoming dress, with her neat\nhead only just touched with grey and her delicate features, her\nsparkling eyes, was still alluring. After dinner the judge, with some\nold brandy still further to mellow him, let himself go, and for a couple\nof hours held us entranced while he told us of celebrated trials in\nwhich he had been concerned, I was not surprised therefore that when\nMiss Gray asked us to lunch with her next day, Landon, even before I\ncould answer, accepted with alacrity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A very nice woman,\" he said when she had left us. \"And a head on her\nshoulders. She must have been very pretty as a girl. She's not bad now.\nWhy isn't she married?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She always says nobody asked her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Stuff and nonsense! Women ought to marry. Too many of these women about\nwho want their independence. I have no patience with them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Gray lived in a little house facing the sea at St. Jean, which is a\ncouple of miles from my own house at Cap Ferrat. We drove down next day\nat one and were shown into her sitting-room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have a surprise for you,\" she said to me, as we shook hands. \"The\nCraigs are coming.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got to know them at last.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I thought it was too absurd that we should live next door to one\nanother, and bathe from the same beach every day and not speak. So I\nforced myself on them, and they've promised to come to lunch to-day. I\nwanted you to meet them, to see what you make of them.\" She turned to\nLandon. \"I hope you don't mind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he was on his best behaviour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sure I shall be delighted to meet any friends of yours, Miss Gray,\"\nhe said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But they're not friends of mine. I've seen a lot of them, but I never\nspoke to them till yesterday. It'll be a treat for them to meet an\nauthor and a celebrated judge.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had heard a good deal of the Craigs from Miss Gray during the previous\nthree weeks. They had taken the cottage next to hers, and at first she\nfeared they would be a nuisance. She liked her own company and did not\nwant to be bothered with the trivialities of social intercourse. But she\nvery quickly discovered that the Craigs were as plainly disinclined to\nstrike up an acquaintance with her as she with them. Though in that\nlittle place they could not but meet two or three times a day, the\nCraigs never by so much a glance gave an indication that they had ever\nseen her before. Miss Gray told me she thought it very tactful of them\nto make no attempt to intrude upon her privacy, but I had an idea that\nshe was not affronted, a little puzzled rather, that they apparently\nwanted to know her as little as she wanted to know them. I had guessed\nsome time before that she would not be able to resist making the first\nadvance. On one occasion, while we were walking, we passed them, and I\nwas able to have a good look at them. Craig was a handsome man, with a\nred, honest face, a grey moustache and thick strong grey hair. He held\nhimself well, and there was a bluff heartiness of manner about him that\nsuggested a broker who had retired on a handsome fortune. His wife was a\nwoman hard of visage, tall and of masculine appearance, with dull, fair\nhair too elaborately dressed, a large nose, a large mouth and a\nweather-beaten skin. She was not only plain but grim. Her clothes,\npretty, flimsy and graceful, sat oddly upon her, for they would better\nhave suited a girl of eighteen, and Mrs. Craig was certainly forty. Miss\nGray told me they were well cut and expensive. I thought he looked\ncommonplace and she looked disagreeable, and I told Miss Gray she was\nlucky that they were obviously disposed to keep themselves to\nthemselves.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's something rather sweet about them,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They love one another. And they adore the baby.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor they had a child that was not more than a year old; and from this\nMiss Gray had concluded that they had not long been married. She liked\nto watch them with their baby. A nurse took it out every morning in a\npram, but before this, father and mother spent an ecstatic quarter of an\nhour teaching it to walk. They stood a few yards apart and urged the\nchild to flounder from one to the other; and each time it tumbled into\nthe parental arms it was lifted up and rapturously embraced. And when\nfinally it was tucked up in the smart pram, they hung over it with\ncharming baby talk and watched it out of sight as though they couldn't\nbear to let it go.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Gray used often to see them walking up and down the lawn of their\ngarden arm in arm; they did not talk, as though they were so happy to be\ntogether that conversation was unnecessary; and it warmed her heart to\nobserve the affection which that dour, unsympathetic woman so obviously\nfelt for her tall, handsome husband. It was a pretty sight to see Mrs.\nCraig brush an invisible speck of dust off his coat, and Miss Gray was\nconvinced that she purposely made holes in his socks in order to have\nthe pleasure of darning them. And it looked as though he loved her as\nmuch as she loved him. Every now and then he would give her a glance,\nand she would look up at him and smile, and he gave her cheek a little\npat. Because they were no longer young, their mutual devotion was\npeculiarly touching.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI never knew why Miss Gray had never married; I felt as certain as the\njudge that she had had plenty of chances; and I asked myself, when she\ntalked to me about the Craigs, whether the sight of this matrimonial\nfelicity didn't give her a slight pang. I suppose complete happiness is\nvery rare in this world, but these two people seemed to enjoy it, and it\nmay be that Miss Gray was so strangely interested in them only because\nshe could not quite suppress the feeling in her heart that by remaining\nsingle she had missed something.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBecause she didn't know what their first names were, she called them\nEdwin and Angelina. She made up a story about them. She told it to me\none day; and when I ridiculed it, she was quite short with me. This, as\nfar as I can remember, is how it went: They had fallen in love with one\nanother years before--perhaps twenty years--when Angelina, a young girl\nthen, had the fresh grace of her teens and Edwin was a brave youth\nsetting out joyously on the journey of life. And since the gods, who are\nsaid to look upon young love with kindliness, nevertheless do not bother\ntheir heads with practical matters, neither Edwin nor Angelina had a\npenny. It was impossible for them to marry, but they had courage, hope\nand confidence. Edwin made up his mind to go out to South America or\nMalaya or where you like, make his fortune and return to marry the girl\nwho had patiently waited for him. It couldn't take more than two or\nthree years, five at the utmost; and what is that, when you're twenty\nand the whole of life is before you? Meanwhile of course Angelina would\nlive with her widowed mother.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut things didn't pan out according to schedule. Edwin found it more\ndifficult than he had expected to make a fortune; in fact, he found it\nhard to earn enough money to keep body and soul together, and only\nAngelina's love and her tender letters gave him the heart to continue\nthe struggle. At the end of five years he was not much better off than\nwhen he started. Angelina would willingly have joined him and shared his\npoverty, but it was impossible for her to leave her mother, bed-ridden\nas she was, poor thing, and there was nothing for them to do but have\npatience. And so the years passed slowly, and Edwin's hair grew grey,\nand Angelina became grim and haggard. Hers was the harder lot, for she\ncould do nothing but wait. The cruel glass showed such charms as she had\npossessed slipping away from her one by one; and at last she discovered\nthat youth, with a mocking laugh and a pirouette, had left her for good.\nHer sweetness turned sour from long tending of a querulous invalid; her\nmind was narrowed by the society of the small town in which she lived.\nHer friends married and had children, but she remained a prisoner to\nduty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe wondered if Edwin still loved her. She wondered if he would ever\ncome back. She often despaired. Ten years went by, and fifteen, and\ntwenty. Then Edwin wrote to say that his affairs were settled, and he\nhad made enough money for them to live upon in comfort, and if she were\nstill willing to marry him, he would return at once. By a merciful\ninterposition of providence, Angelina's mother chose that very moment to\nabandon a world in which she had made herself a thorough nuisance. But\nwhen after so long a separation they met, Angelina saw with dismay that\nEdwin was as young as ever. It's true his hair was grey, but it\ninfinitely became him. He had always been good-looking, but now he was a\nvery handsome man in the flower of his age. She felt as old as the\nhills. She was conscious of her narrowness, her terrible provincialism,\ncompared with the breadth he had acquired by his long sojourn in foreign\ncountries. He was gay and breezy as of old, but her spirit was crushed.\nThe bitterness of life had warped her soul. It seemed monstrous to bind\nthat alert and active man to her by a promise twenty years old, and she\noffered him his release. He went deathly pale.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you care for me any more?\" he cried brokenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd she realised on a sudden--oh, the rapture, oh, the relief!--that to\nhim she was just the same as she had ever been. He had thought of her\nalways as she was; her portrait had been, as it were, stamped on his\nheart, so that now, when the real woman stood before him, she was, to\nhim, still eighteen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo they were married.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't believe a word of it,\" I said when Miss Gray had brought her\nstory to its happy ending.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I insist on your believing it,\" she said. \"I'm convinced it's true, and\nI haven't the smallest doubt that they'll live happily together to a\nripe old age.\" Then she made a remark that I thought rather shrewd.\n\"Their love is founded on an illusion, perhaps; but since it has to them\nall the appearance of reality, what does it matter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhile I have told you this idyllic story of Miss Gray's invention, the\nthree of us, our hostess, Landon and myself, waited for the Craigs to\ncome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you ever noticed that if people live next door to you, they're\ninvariably late?\" Miss Gray asked the judge.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I haven't,\" he answered acidly. \"I'm always punctual myself, and I\nexpect other people to be punctual.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose it's no good offering you a cocktail?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"None whatever, madam.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I have some sherry that they tell me isn't bad.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe judge took the bottle out of her hands and looked at the label. A\nfaint smile broke on his thin lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is a civilised drink, Miss Gray. With your permission I will help\nmyself. I never knew a woman yet who knew how to pour out a glass of\nwine. One should hold a woman by the waist, but a bottle by the neck.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhile he was sipping the old sherry with every sign of satisfaction,\nMiss Gray glanced out of the window.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, that's why the Craigs are late. They were waiting for the baby to\ncome back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI followed her eyes and saw that the nurse had just pushed the pram past\nMiss Gray's house on her way home. Craig took the baby out of the pram\nand lifted it high in the air. The baby, trying to tug at his moustache,\ncrowed gleefully. Mrs. Craig stood by, watching, and the smile on her\nface made her harsh features almost pleasant. The window was open, and\nwe heard her speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come along, darling,\" she said, \"we're late.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put the baby back in the pram, and they came up to the door of Miss\nGray's house and rang the bell. The maid showed them in. They shook\nhands with Miss Gray, and because I was standing near, she introduced me\nto them. Then she turned to the judge.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And this is Sir Edward Landon--Mr. and Mrs. Craig.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne would have expected the judge to move forward with an outstretched\nhand, but he remained stock-still. He put his eyeglass up to his eye,\nthat eyeglass that I had on more than one occasion seen him use with\ndevastating effect in court, and stared at the newcomers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gosh, what a dirty customer,\" I said to myself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe let the glass drop from his eye.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How do you do,\" he said. \"Am I mistaken in thinking that we've met\nbefore?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe question turned my eyes to the Craigs. They stood side by side close\nto one another, as though they had drawn together for mutual protection.\nThey did not speak. Mrs. Craig looked terrified. Craig's red face was\ndarkened by a purple flush, and his eyes appeared almost to start out of\nhis head. But that only lasted a second.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think so,\" he said in a rich, deep voice. \"Of course I've heard\nof you, Sir Edward.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"More people know Tom Fool than Tom Fool knows,\" said he.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Gray meanwhile had been giving the cocktail-shaker a shake, and now\nshe handed cocktails to her two guests. She had noticed nothing. I\ndidn't know what it all meant; in fact, I wasn't sure it meant anything.\nThe incident, if incident there was, passed so quickly that I was half\ninclined to think that I had read into the strangers' momentary\nembarrassment on being introduced to a celebrated man something for\nwhich there was no foundation. I set about making myself pleasant. I\nasked them how they liked the Riviera and if they were comfortable in\ntheir house. Miss Gray joined in, and we chatted, as one does with\nstrangers, of commonplace things. They talked easily and pleasantly.\nMrs. Craig said how much they enjoyed the bathing and complained of the\ndifficulty of getting fish at the seaside. I was aware that the judge\ndid not join in the conversation, but looked down at his feet as though\nhe were unconscious of the company.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLunch was announced. We went into the dining-room. We were only five,\nand it was a small round table, so the conversation could not be\nanything but general. I must confess that it was carried on chiefly by\nMiss Gray and myself. The judge was silent, but he often was, for he was\na moody creature, and I paid no attention. I noticed that he ate the\nomelette with good appetite, and when it was passed round again took a\nsecond helping. The Craigs struck me as a little shy, but that didn't\nsurprise me, and as the second course was produced they began to talk\nmore freely. It didn't strike me that they were very amusing people;\nthey didn't seem interested in very much besides their baby, the\nvagaries of the two Italian maids they had, and an occasional flutter at\nMonte Carlo; and I couldn't help thinking that Miss Gray had erred in\nmaking their acquaintance. Then suddenly something happened: Craig rose\nabruptly from his chair and fell headlong to the floor. We jumped up.\nMrs. Craig threw herself down, over her husband, and took his head in\nher hands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's all right, George,\" she cried in an agonised tone. \"It's all\nright!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Put his head down,\" I said. \"He's only fainted.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI felt his pulse and could feel nothing. I said he had fainted, but I\nwasn't sure it wasn't a stroke. He was the sort of heavy, plethoric man\nwho might easily have one. Miss Gray dipped her napkin into water and\ndabbed his forehead. Mrs. Craig seemed distraught. Then I noticed that\nLandon had remained quietly sitting in his chair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If he's fainted, you're not helping him to recover by crowding round\nhim,\" he said acidly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Craig turned her head and gave him a look of bitter hatred.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll ring up the doctor,\" said Miss Gray.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I don't think that's necessary,\" I said. \"He's coming to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI could feel his pulse growing stronger, and in a minute or two he\nopened his eyes. He gasped when he realised what had happened, and tried\nto struggle to his feet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't move,\" I said. \"Lie still a little longer.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI got him to drink a glass of brandy, and the colour came back to his\nface.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I feel all right now,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'll get you into the next room, and you can lie on the sofa for a\nbit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I'd sooner go home. It's only a step.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got up from the floor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, let's go back,\" said Mrs. Craig. She turned to Miss Gray. \"I'm so\nsorry; he's never done anything like this before.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were determined to go, and I thought myself it was the best thing\nfor them to do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Put him to bed and keep him there, and he'll be as right as rain\nto-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Craig took one of his arms and I took the other; Miss Gray opened\nthe door, and though still a bit shaky, he was able to walk. When we\narrived at the Craig's home, I offered to go in and help undress him;\nbut they would neither of them hear of it. I went back to Miss Gray's\nand found them at dessert.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder why he fainted,\" Miss Gray was saying. \"All the windows are\nopen, and it's not particularly hot to-day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder,\" said the judge.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI noticed that his thin pale face bore an expression of some\ncomplacency. We had our coffee; and then, since the judge and I were\ngoing to play golf, we got into the car and drove up the hill to my\nhouse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did Miss Gray get to know those people?\" Landon asked me. \"They\nstruck me as rather second-rate. I shouldn't have thought they were very\nmuch her mark.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know women. She likes her privacy, and when they settled in next\ndoor, she was quite decided that she wouldn't have anything to do with\nthem; but when she discovered that they didn't want to have anything to\ndo with her, she couldn't rest till she'd made their acquaintance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI told him the story she had invented about her neighbours. He listened\nwith an expressionless face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid your friend Miss Gray is a sentimental donkey, my dear\nfellow,\" he said when I had come to an end. \"I tell you, women ought to\nmarry. She'd soon have had all that nonsense knocked out of her if she'd\nhad half a dozen brats.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you know about the Craigs?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave me a frigid glance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I? Why should I know anything about them? I thought they were very\nordinary people.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI wish I knew how to describe the strong impression he gave me, both by\nthe glacial austerity of his look and by the rasping finality of his\ntone, that he was not prepared to say anything more. We finished the\ndrive in silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLandon was well on in his sixties, and he was the kind of golfer who\nnever hits a long ball but is never off the straight, and he was a\ndeadly putter, so, though he gave me strokes, he beat me handsomely.\nAfter dinner I took him in to Monte Carlo, where he finished the evening\nby winning a couple of thousand francs at the roulette table. These\nsuccessive events put him into a remarkably good humour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A very pleasant day,\" he said when we parted for the night. \"I've\nthoroughly enjoyed it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI spent the next morning at work, and we did not meet till lunch. We\nwere just finishing when I was called to the telephone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen I came back, my guest was drinking a second cup of coffee.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That was Miss Gray,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh? What had she to say?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Craigs have done a bolt. They disappeared last night. The maids\nlive in the village; and when they came this morning, they found the\nhouse empty. They'd skipped--the Craigs, the nurse and the baby--and\ntaken their luggage with them. They left money on the table for the\nmaids' wages, the rent to the end of their tenancy and the tradesmen's\nbills.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe judge said nothing. He took a cigar from the box, examined it\ncarefully and then lit it with deliberation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What have you got to say about that?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear fellow, are you obliged to use these American phrases? Isn't\nEnglish good enough for you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is that an American phrase? It expresses exactly what I mean. You can't\nimagine I'm such a fool as not to have noticed that you and the Craigs\nhad met before; and if they've vanished into thin air like figments of\nthe imagination, it's a fairly reasonable conclusion that the\ncircumstances under which you met were not altogether pleasant.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe judge gave a little chuckle, and there was a twinkle in his cold\nblue eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That was a very good brandy you gave me last night,\" he said. \"It's\nagainst my principles to drink liqueurs after lunch, but it's a very\ndull man who allows his principles to enslave him, and for once I think\nI should enjoy one.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI sent for the brandy and watched the judge while he poured himself out\na generous measure. He took a sip with obvious satisfaction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you remembered the Wingford murder?\" he asked me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps you weren't in England at the time. Pity--you might have come\nto the trial. You'd have enjoyed it. It caused a lot of excitement; the\npapers were full of it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Miss Wingford was a rich spinster of mature age who lived in the\ncountry with a companion. She was a healthy woman for her age; and when\nshe died rather suddenly, her friends were surprised. Her physician, a\nfellow called Brandon, signed the certificate and she was duly buried.\nThe will was read, and it appeared that she had left everything she had,\nsomething between sixty and seventy thousand pounds, to her companion.\nThe relations were very sore, but there was nothing they could do about\nit. The will had been drawn up by her lawyer and witnessed by his clerk\nand Dr. Brandon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But Miss Wingford had a maid who had been with her for thirty years and\nhad always understood that she would be remembered in the will; she\nclaimed that Miss Wingford had promised to leave her well provided for,\nand when she found that she wasn't even mentioned, she flew into a\npassion. She told the nephew and the two nieces who had come down for\nthe funeral that she was sure Miss Wingford had been poisoned, and she\nsaid that if they didn't go to the police, she'd go herself. Well, they\ndidn't do that, but they went to see Dr. Brandon. He laughed. He said\nthat Miss Wingford had had a weak heart and he'd been treating her for\nyears. She died just as he had always expected her to die, peacefully in\nher sleep; and he advised them not to pay any attention to what the maid\nsaid. She had always hated the companion, a Miss Starling, and been\njealous of her. Dr. Brandon was highly respected; he had been Miss\nWingford's doctor for a long time, and the two nieces, who'd stayed with\nher often, knew him well. He was not profiting by the will, and there\nseemed no reason to doubt his word, so the family thought there was\nnothing to do but make the best of a bad job and went back to London.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But the maid went on talking; she talked so much that at last the\npolice, much against their will, I must admit, were obliged to take\nnotice, and an order to exhume the body was made. There was an inquest,\nand it was found that Miss Wingford had died from an overdose of\nveronal. The coroner's jury found that it had been administered by Miss\nStarling, and she was arrested. A detective was sent down from Scotland\nYard, and he got together some unexpected evidence. It appeared that\nthere'd been a good deal of gossip about Miss Starling and Dr. Brandon.\nThey'd been seen a lot together in places in which there was no reason\nfor them to be except that they wanted to be together, and the general\nimpression in the village was that they were only waiting for Miss\nWingford to die to get married. That put a very different complexion on\nthe case. To make a long story short, the police got enough evidence in\ntheir opinion to justify them in arresting the doctor and charging him\nand Miss Starling with the murder of the old lady.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe judge took another sip of brandy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The case came up for trial before me. The case for the prosecution was\nthat the accused were madly in love with one another and had done the\npoor old lady to death so that they could marry on the fortune Miss\nStarling had wheedled her employer into leaving her. Miss Wingford\nalways had a cup of cocoa when she went to bed, which Miss Starling\nprepared for her; and the counsel for the prosecution claimed that it\nwas in this that Miss Starling had dissolved the tablets that caused\nMiss Wingford's death. The accused elected to give evidence on their own\nbehalf, and they made a miserable showing in the witness-box. They lied\ntheir heads off. Though witnesses testified they had seen them walking\ntogether at night with their arms round one another's waists, though\nBrandon's maid testified she had seen them kissing one another in the\ndoctor's house, they swore they were no more than friends. And oddly\nenough, medical evidence proved that Miss Starling was <i>virgo intacta</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Brandon admitted that he had given Miss Wingford a bottle of veronal\ntablets because she complained of sleeplessness, but declared he had\nwarned her never to take more than one, and then only when absolutely\nnecessary. The defence sought to prove that she had taken the tablets\neither by accident or because she wanted to commit suicide. That didn't\nhold water for a moment. Miss Wingford was a jolly, normal old lady who\nthoroughly enjoyed life; and her death occurred two days before the\nexpected arrival of an old friend for a week's visit. She hadn't\ncomplained to the maid of sleeping badly--in fact, her maid had always\nthought her a very good sleeper. It was impossible to believe that she\nhad accidentally taken a sufficient number of tablets to kill herself.\nPersonally, I had no doubt that it was a put-up job between the doctor\nand the companion. The motive was obvious and sufficient. I summed up\nand I hope summed up fairly; but it was my duty to put the facts before\nthe jury, and to my mind the facts were damning. The jury filed out. I\ndon't suppose you know that when you are sitting on the bench, you\nsomehow get the feeling of the court. You have to be on your guard\nagainst it, to be sure it doesn't influence you. I never had it more\nstrongly than on that day that there wasn't a soul in court who wasn't\nconvinced that those two people had committed the crime with which they\nwere charged. I hadn't the shadow of a doubt that the jury would bring\nin a verdict of guilty. Juries are incalculable. They were out for three\nhours, and when they came back I knew at once that I was mistaken. In a\nmurder case, when a jury is going to bring in a verdict of guilty they\nwon't look at the prisoner; they look away. I noticed that three or four\nof the jurymen glanced at the two prisoners in the dock. They brought in\na verdict of not guilty. The real names of Mr. and Mrs. Craig are Dr.\nand Mrs. Brandon. I'm just as certain as I am that I'm sitting here that\nthey committed between them a cruel and heartless murder and richly\ndeserved to be hanged.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you think made the jury find them not guilty?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've asked myself that; and do you know the only explanation I can\ngive? The fact that it was conclusively proved that they had never been\nlovers. And if you come to think of it, that's one of the most curious\nfeatures of the whole case. That woman was prepared to commit murder to\nget the man she loved, but she wasn't prepared to have an illicit\nlove-affair with him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Human nature is very odd, isn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very,\" said Landon, helping himself to another glass of brandy.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nFor some time I could not make up my mind if I liked Peter Melrose or\nnot. He had had a novel published that had caused some stir among the\nrather dreary but worthy people who are always on the lookout for new\ntalent. Elderly gentlemen with nothing much to do but go to luncheon\nparties praised it with girlish enthusiasm, and wiry little women who\ndidn't get on with their husbands thought it showed promise. I read a\nfew reviews. They contradicted one another freely. Some of the critics\nclaimed that with this first novel the author had sprung into the front\nrank of English novelists: others reviled it. I did not read it. I have\nlearnt by experience that when a book makes a sensation it is just as\nwell to wait a year before you read it. It is astonishing how many books\nthen you need not read at all. But it chanced that one day I met Peter\nMelrose. With some misgiving I had accepted an invitation to a sherry\nparty. It was in the top flat of a converted house in Bloomsbury, and I\nwas a trifle out of breath when I had climbed four flights of stairs. My\nhostesses were two women, much over life-size, in early middle life, the\nsort of women who know all about the insides of motor-cars and like a\ngood tramp in the rain, but very feminine for all that, fond of eating\nout of paper bags. The drawing-room, which they called \"our workshop\",\nthough being of independent means neither had ever done a stroke of work\nin her life, was large and bare, furnished with rustless-steel chairs,\nwhich looked as though they could with difficulty support the very\nsubstantial weight of their owners, glass-topped tables and a vast divan\ncovered with zebra-skin. On the walls were book-shelves, and pictures by\nthe better-known English imitators of Cézanne, Braque and Picasso. In\nthe shelves, besides a number of \"curious\" books of the eighteenth\ncentury (for pornography is ageless) there were only the works of living\nauthors, mostly first editions, and it was indeed to sign some of my own\nthat I had been asked to the party.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was quite small. There was but one other woman, who might have been a\nyounger sister of my hostesses, for, though stout, she was not quite so\nstout, though tall, not quite so tall, and though hearty, not quite so\nhearty. I did not catch her name, but she answered to that of Boofuls.\nThe only man besides myself was Peter Melrose. He was quite young,\ntwenty-two or twenty-three, of the middle height, but with an ungainly\nfigure that made him look squat. He had a reddish skin that seemed to\nfit over the bones of his face too tightly, a rather large semitic nose,\nthough he was not a Jew, and alert green eyes under bushy eyebrows. His\nbrown hair, cut very short, was scurfy. He was dressed in the brown\nNorfolk jacket and grey flannel trousers that are worn by the art\nstudents who wander hatless along King's Road, Chelsea. An uncouth young\nman. Nor was there much to attract in his manner. He was self-assertive,\ndisputatious and intolerant. He had a hearty contempt for his\nfellow-writers which he expressed with zest. The satisfaction he gave me\nby his breezy attacks on reputations which for my part I considered\nexaggerated, but prudently held my tongue about, was only lessened by\nthe conviction that no sooner was my back turned than he would tear my\nown to shreds. He talked well. He was amusing and sometimes witty. I\nshould have laughed at his sallies more easily if those three ladies had\nnot been so unreasonably convulsed by them. They roared with laughter at\nwhat he said, whether it was funny or whether it was inept. He said many\nsilly things, for he talked without stopping, but he also said some very\nclever ones. He had a point of view, crude and not so original as he\nthought, but sincere. But the most striking thing about him was his\neager, impetuous vitality; it was like a hot flame that burnt him with\nan unendurable fury. It even shed a glow on those about him. He had\nsomething, if only that, and when I left it was with a slight sense of\ncuriosity at what would come of him. I did not know if he had talent; so\nmany young things can write a clever novel--that means nothing; but it\nseemed to me that as a man he was not quite like everybody else. He was\nthe sort of person who at thirty, when time had softened his asperity\nand experience had taught him that he was not quite so intelligent as he\nthought, would turn into an interesting and agreeable fellow. But I\nnever expected to see him again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was with surprise that I received two or three days later a copy of\nhis novel with a very flattering dedication. I read it. It was obviously\nautobiographical. The scene was a small town in Sussex, and the\ncharacters of the upper middle class that strives to keep up appearances\non an inadequate income. The humour was rather brutal and rather vulgar.\nIt grated on me, for it consisted chiefly of mockery at people because\nthey were old and poor. Peter Melrose did not know how hard those\nmisfortunes are to bear, and that the efforts made to cope with them are\nmore deserving of sympathy than of derision. But there were descriptions\nof places, little pictures of a room or impressions of the countryside,\nwhich were excellently done. They showed tenderness and a sense of the\nspiritual beauty of material things. The book was written easily,\nwithout affectation, and with a pleasant feeling for the sound of words.\nBut what made it indeed somewhat remarkable, so that I understood why it\nhad attracted attention, was the passion that quivered in the love story\nof which the plot, such as it was, consisted. It was, as is the modern\nfashion, more than a trifle coarse and, again in the modern fashion, it\ntailed off vaguely, without any particular result, so that everything\nwas left in the end pretty much as it had been in the beginning; but you\ndid get the impression of young love, idealistic and yet vehemently\nsexual; it was so vivid and so deeply felt that it took your breath\naway, it seemed to throb on the printed page like the pulse of life. It\nhad no reticence. It was absurd, scandalous and beautiful. It was like a\nforce of nature. That was passion all right. There is nothing, anywhere,\nso moving and so awe-inspiring.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI wrote to Peter Melrose and told him what I thought of his book, then\nsuggested that we might lunch together. He rang me up next day and we\nmade a date.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI found him unaccountably shy when we sat down opposite one another at a\ntable in a restaurant. I gave him a cocktail. He talked glibly enough,\nbut I could not help seeing that he was ill at ease. I gained the\nimpression that his self-assurance was a pose assumed to conceal, from\nhimself, maybe, a diffidence that tortured him. His manners were brusque\nand awkward. He would say a rude thing and then laugh nervously to cover\nhis own embarrassment. Though he pretended to be so sure of himself he\nwanted all the time to be reassured by you. By irritating you, by saying\nthe things he thought would annoy, he tried to force from you some\nadmission, tacit it might be, that he was as wonderful as he longed to\nthink himself. He wanted to despise the opinion of his fellows, and\nnothing was more important to him. I thought him rather an odious young\nman, but I did not mind that. It is very natural that clever young men\nshould be rather odious. They are conscious of gifts that they do not\nknow how to use. They are exasperated with the world that will not\nrecognise their merit. They have something to give, and no hand is\nstretched out to receive it. They are impatient for the fame they regard\nas their due. No, I do not mind odious young men; it is when they are\ncharming that I button up the pockets of my sympathy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPeter Melrose was extremely modest about his book. He blushed through\nhis reddish skin when I praised what I liked in it, and accepted my\nstrictures with a humility that was almost embarrassing. He had made\nvery little money out of it, and his publishers were giving him a small\nmonthly allowance in advance of royalties on the next one. This he had\njust started, but he wanted to get away to write it in peace, and\nknowing I lived on the Riviera he asked me if I could tell him of a\nquiet place where he could bathe and live cheaply. I suggested that he\nshould come and spend a few days with me so that he could look about\ntill he found something to suit him. His green eyes sparkled when I\nproposed this and he flushed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shouldn't I be an awful nuisance?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. I shall be working. All I can offer you is three meals a day and a\nroom to sleep in. It'll be very dull, but you can do exactly what you\nlike.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It sounds grand. May I let you know if I decide to come?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe separated, and a week or two later I went home. This was in May.\nEarly in June I received a letter from Peter Melrose asking, if I had\nreally meant what I said when I invited him to spend a few days with me,\nwhether he might arrive on such and such a date. Well, at the time I had\nmeant it, but now, a month later, I remembered that he was an arrogant\nand ill-bred youth, whom I had seen but twice and wasn't in the least\ninterested in, and I didn't mean it any longer. It seemed to me very\nlikely that he would be bored stiff. I lived a very quiet life and saw\nfew people. And I thought it would be a great strain on my nerves if he\nwere as rude as I knew he could be, and I as his host felt it behoved me\nto keep my temper. I saw myself driven beyond endurance, and ringing the\nbell to have his clothes packed and the car brought round to take him\naway within half an hour. But there was nothing to do about it. It would\nsave him the cost of board and lodging to spend a short period with me,\nand if he was tired and unhappy as he said in his letter it might be\nthat it would do him good. I sent him a wire and shortly afterwards he\narrived.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked very hot and grubby in his grey flannel trousers and brown\ntweed coat when I met him at the station, but after a swim in the pool\nhe changed into white shorts and a Cochet shirt. He looked then quite\nabsurdly young. He had never been out of England before. He was excited.\nIt was touching to see his delight. He seemed, amid those unaccustomed\nsurroundings, to lose his sense of himself, and he was simple, boyish\nand modest. I was agreeably surprised. In the evening, after dinner,\nsitting in the garden, with only the croaking of the little green frogs\nto break the silence, he began talking to me of his novel. It was a\nromantic story about a young writer and a celebrated prima donna. The\ntheme was reminiscent of Ouida, the last thing I should have expected\nthis hard-boiled youth to write, and I was tickled; it was odd how the\nfashion completed the circle and returned generation after generation to\nthe same themes. I had no doubt that Peter Melrose would treat it in a\nvery modern way, but there it was, the same old story as had entranced\nsentimental readers in the three-volume novels of the eighties. He\nproposed to set it in the beginning of the Edwardian era, which to the\nyoung has already acquired the fantastic, far-away feeling of a past\nage. He talked and talked. He was not unpleasant to listen to. He had no\nnotion that he was putting into fiction his own day-dreams, the comic\nand touching day-dreams of a rather unattractive, obscure young man who\nsees himself beloved, to the admiration of the whole world, by an\nincredibly beautiful, celebrated and magnificent woman. I always enjoyed\nthe novels of Ouida and Peter's idea did not at all displease me. With\nhis charming gift of description, his vivid, ingenuous way of looking at\nmaterial things, fabrics, pieces of furniture, walls, trees, flowers,\nand his power of representing the passion of life, the passion of love,\nthat thrilled every fibre of his own uncouth body, I had a notion that\nhe might well produce something exuberant, absurd and poetical. But I\nasked him a question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you ever known a prima donna?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, but I've read all the autobiographies and memoirs that I could\nfind. I've gone into it pretty thoroughly. Not only the obvious things,\nyou know, but I've hunted around in all sorts of byways to get the\nrevealing touch or the suggestive anecdote.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And have you got what you wanted?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think so.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe began to describe his heroine to me. She was young and beautiful,\nwilful it is true and with a quick temper, but magnanimous. A woman on\nthe grand scale. Music was her passion; there was music not only in her\nvoice, but in her gestures and in her inmost thoughts. She was devoid of\nenvy, and her appreciation of art was such that when another singer had\ndone her an injury she forgave her when she heard her sing a role\nbeautifully. She was of a wonderful generosity, and would give away\neverything she possessed when a story of misfortune touched her soft\nheart. She was a great lover, prepared to sacrifice the world for the\nman she loved. She was intelligent and well-read. She was tender,\nunselfish and disinterested. In fact she was much too good to be true.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think you'd better meet a prima donna,\" I said at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How can I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you ever heard of La Falterona?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I have. I've read her memoirs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She lives just along the coast. I'll ring her up and ask her to\ndinner.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you really? It would be wonderful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't blame me if you don't find her quite what you expect.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's the truth I want.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEveryone has heard of La Falterona. Not even Melba had a greater\nreputation. She had ceased now to sing in opera, but her voice was still\nlovely, and she could fill a concert hall in any part of the world. She\nwent for long tours every winter, and in summer rested in a villa by the\nsea. On the Riviera people are neighbours if they live thirty miles from\none another, and for some years I had seen a good deal of La Falterona.\nShe was a woman of ardent temperament, and she was celebrated not only\nfor her singing, but for her love affairs: she never minded talking\nabout them, and I had often sat entranced for hours while with the\nhumour which to me was her most astonishing characteristic she regaled\nme with lurid tales of royal or very opulent adorers. I was satisfied\nthat there was at least a measure of truth in them. She had been\nmarried, for short periods, three or four times, and in one of these\nunions had annexed a Neapolitan prince. Thinking that to be known as La\nFalterona was grander than any title, she did not use his name (to which\nindeed she had no right, since after divorcing him she had married\nsomebody else); but her silver, her cutlery and her dinner-service were\nheavily decorated with a coat of arms and a crown, and her servants\ninvariably addressed her as <i>madame la princesse</i>. She claimed to be a\nHungarian, but her English was perfect; she spoke it with a slight\naccent (when she remembered), but with an intonation suggestive, I had\nbeen told, of Kansas City. This she explained by saying that her father\nwas a political exile who had fled to America when she was no more than\na child; but she did not seem quite sure whether he was a distinguished\nscientist who had got into trouble for his liberal views, or a Magyar of\nhigh rank who had brought down on his head the imperial wrath because he\nhad had a love affair with an Archduchess. It depended on whether she\nwas just an artist among artists, or a great lady among persons of noble\nbirth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith me she was not natural, for that she could never have been if she\nhad tried, but franker than with anyone else. She had a natural and\nhealthy contempt for the arts. She genuinely looked upon the whole thing\nas a gigantic bluff, and deep down in her heart was an amused sympathy\nfor all the people who were able to put it over on the public. I will\nadmit that I looked forward to the encounter between Peter Melrose and\nLa Falterona with a good deal of sardonic amusement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe liked coming to dine with me because she knew the food was good. It\nwas the only meal she ate in the day, for she took great care of her\nfigure, but she liked that one to be succulent and ample. I asked her to\ncome at nine, knowing that was the earliest hour she dreamt of eating,\nand ordered dinner for half past. She turned up at a quarter to ten. She\nwas dressed in apple-green satin, cut very low in front, with no back at\nall, and she wore a string of huge pearls, a number of expensive-looking\nrings, and on her left arm diamond and emerald bracelets from the wrist\nto the elbow. Two or three of them were certainly real. On her\nraven-black hair was a thin circlet of diamonds. She could not have\nlooked more splendid if she had been going to a ball at Stafford House\nin the old days. We were in white ducks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How grand you are,\" I said. \"I told you it wasn't a party.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe flashed a look of her magnificent black eyes at Peter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course it's a party. You told me your friend was a writer of talent.\nI am only an interpreter.\" She ran one finger down her flashing\nbracelets. \"This is the homage I pay to the creative artist.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not utter the vulgar monosyllable that rose to my lips, but\noffered her what I knew was her favourite cocktail. I was privileged to\ncall her Maria, and she always called me Master. This she did, first\nbecause she knew it made me feel a perfect fool, and secondly because,\nthough she was in point of fact not more than two or three years younger\nthan I, it made it quite clear that we belonged to different\ngenerations. Sometimes, however, she also called me you dirty swine.\nThis evening she certainly might very well have passed for thirty-five.\nShe had those rather large features which somehow do not seem to betray\nage. On the stage she was a beautiful woman, and even in private life,\nnotwithstanding her big nose, large mouth and fleshy face, a\ngood-looking one. She wore a brown make-up, with dark rouge, and her\nlips were vividly scarlet. She looked very Spanish and, I suspected,\nfelt it, for her accent at the beginning of dinner was quite Sevillian.\nI wanted her to talk so that Peter should get his money's worth, and I\nknew there was but one subject in the world that she could talk about.\nShe was in point of fact a stupid woman who had acquired a line of glib\nchatter which made people on first meeting her think she was as\nbrilliant as she looked; but it was merely a performance she gave, and\nyou soon discovered that she not only did not know what she was talking\nabout, but was not in the least interested in it. I do not think she had\never read a book in her life. Her knowledge of what was going on in the\nworld was confined to what she was able to gather by looking at the\npictures in the illustrated press. Her passion for music was complete\nbunkum. Once at a concert to which I went with her she slept all through\nthe Fifth Symphony, and I was charmed to hear her during the interval\ntelling people that Beethoven stirred her so much that she hesitated to\ncome and hear him, for with those glorious themes singing through her\nhead, it meant that she wouldn't sleep a wink all night: I could well\nbelieve she would lie awake, for she had had so sound a nap during the\nSymphony that it could not but interfere with her night's rest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut there was one subject in which her interest never failed. She\npursued it with indefatigable energy. No obstacle prevented her from\nreturning to it; no chance word was so remote that she could not use it\nas a stepping-stone to come back to it, and in effecting this she\ndisplayed a cleverness of which one would never have thought her\ncapable. On this subject she could be witty, vivacious, philosophic,\ntragic and inventive. It enabled her to exhibit all the resources of her\ningenuity. There was no end to its ramifications, and no limit to its\nvariety. This subject was herself. I gave her an opening at once and\nthen all I had to do was to make suitable interjections. She was in\ngreat form. We were dining on the terrace and a full moon was obligingly\nshining on the sea in front of us. Nature, as though she knew what was\nproper to the occasion, had set just the right scene. The view was\nframed by two tall black cypresses, and all round us on the terrace the\norange trees in full flower exhaled their heady perfume. There was no\nwind, and the candles on the table flamed with a steady softness. It was\na light that exactly suited La Falterona. She sat between us, eating\nheartily and thoroughly appreciating the champagne, and she was enjoying\nherself. She gave the moon a glance. On the sea was a broad pathway of\nsilver.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How beautiful nature is,\" she said. \"My God, the scenery one has to\nplay in. How can they expect one to sing? You know, really, the sets at\nCovent Garden are a disgrace. The last time I sang Juliet I just told\nthem I wouldn't go on unless they did something about the moon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPeter listened to her in silence. He ate her words. She was better value\nthan I had dared to hope. She got a little tight not only on the\nchampagne but on her own loquaciousness. To listen to her you would have\nthought she was a meek and docile creature against whom the whole world\nwas in conspiracy. Her life had been one long bitter struggle against\ndesperate odds. Managers treated her vilely, impresarios played foul\ntricks on her, singers combined to ruin her, critics bought by the money\nof her enemies wrote scandalous things about her, lovers for whom she\nhad sacrificed everything used her with base ingratitude; and yet, by\nthe miracle of her genius and her quick wits, she had discomfited them\nall. With joyous glee, her eyes flashing, she told us how she had\ndefeated their machinations and what disaster had befallen the wretches\nwho had stood in her way. I wondered how she had the nerve to tell the\ndisgraceful stories she told. Without the smallest consciousness of what\nshe was doing she showed herself vindictive and envious, hard as nails,\nincredibly vain, cruel, selfish, scheming and mercenary. I stole a\nglance now and then at Peter. I was tickled at the confusion he must be\nexperiencing when he compared his ideal picture of the prima donna with\nthe ruthless reality. She was a woman without a heart. When at last she\nleft us I turned to Peter with a smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well,\" I said, \"at all events you've got some good material.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know, and it all fits in so beautifully,\" he said with enthusiasm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does it?\" I exclaimed, taken aback.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's exactly like my woman. She'll never believe that I'd sketched out\nthe main lines of the character before I'd ever seen her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI stared at him in amazement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The passion for art. The disinterestedness. She has that same nobility\nof soul that I saw in my mind's eye. The small-minded, the curious, the\nvulgar put every obstacle in her way and she sweeps them all aside by\nthe greatness of her purpose and the purity of her ends.\" He gave a\nlittle happy laugh. \"Isn't it wonderful how nature copies art? I swear\nto you, I've got her to the life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was about to speak; I held my tongue; though I shrugged a spiritual\nshoulder I was touched. Peter had seen in her what he was determined to\nsee. There was something very like beauty in his illusion. In his own\nway he was a poet. We went to bed, and two or three days later, having\nfound a pension to his liking, he left me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn course of time his book appeared, and like most second novels by\nyoung people it had but a very moderate success. The critics had\noverpraised his first effort and now were unduly censorious. It is of\ncourse a very different thing to write a novel about yourself and the\npeople you have known from childhood and to write one about persons of\nyour own invention. Peter's was too long. He had allowed his gift for\nword-painting to run away with him, the humour was still rather vulgar;\nbut he had reconstructed the period with skill, and the romantic story\nhad that same thrill of real passion which in his first book had so much\nimpressed me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter the dinner at my house I did not see La Falterona for more than a\nyear. She went for a long tour in South America and did not come down to\nthe Riviera till late in the summer. One night she asked me to dine with\nher. We were alone but for her companion-secretary, an Englishwoman,\nMiss Glaser by name, whom La Falterona bullied and ill-treated, hit and\nswore at, but whom she could not do without. Miss Glaser was a haggard\nperson of fifty, with grey hair and a sallow, wrinkled face. She was a\nqueer creature. She knew everything there was to be known about La\nFalterona. She both adored and hated her. Behind her back she could be\nextremely funny at her expense, and the imitation she gave in secret of\nthe great singer with her admirers was the most richly comic thing I\nhave ever heard. But she watched over her like a mother. It was she who,\nsometimes by wheedling, sometimes by sheer plainness of speech, caused\nLa Falterona to behave herself something like a human being. It was she\nwho had written the singer's exceedingly inaccurate memoirs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLa Falterona wore pale-blue satin pyjamas (she liked satin) and,\npresumably to rest her hair, a green silk wig; except for a few rings, a\npearl necklace, a couple of bracelets and a diamond brooch at her waist,\nshe wore no jewellery. She had much to tell me of her triumphs in South\nAmerica. She talked on and on. She had never been in more superb voice\nand the ovations she had received were unparalleled. The concert halls\nwere sold out for every performance, and she had made a packet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it true or is it not true, Glaser?\" cried Maria with a strong South\nAmerican accent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Most of it,\" said Miss Glaser.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLa Falterona had the objectionable habit of addressing her companion by\nher surname. But it must long since have ceased to annoy the poor woman,\nso there was not much point in it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who was that man we met in Buenos Ayres?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Which man?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You fool, Glaser. You remember perfectly. The man I was married to\nonce.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pepe Zapata,\" Miss Glaser replied without a smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was broke. He had the impudence to ask me to give him back a diamond\nnecklace he'd given me. He said it had belonged to his mother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It wouldn't have hurt you to give it him,\" said Miss Glaser. \"You never\nwear it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give it him back?\" cried La Falterona, and her astonishment was such\nthat she spoke the purest English. \"Give it him back? You're crazy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at Miss Glaser as though she expected her there and then to\nhave an attack of acute mania. She got up from the table, for we had\nfinished our dinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let us go outside,\" she said. \"If I hadn't the patience of an angel I'd\nhave sacked that woman long ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLa Falterona and I went out, but Miss Glaser did not come with us. We\nsat on the verandah. There was a magnificent cedar in the garden, and\nits dark branches were silhouetted against the starry sky. The sea,\nalmost at our feet, was marvellously still. Suddenly La Falterona gave a\nstart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I almost forgot. Glaser, you fool,\" she shouted, \"why didn't you remind\nme?\" And then again to me: \"I'm furious with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm glad you didn't remember till after dinner,\" I answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That friend of yours and his book.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI didn't immediately grasp what she was talking about.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What friend and what book?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be so stupid. An ugly little man with a shiny face and a bad\nfigure. He wrote a book about me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh! Peter Melrose. But it's not about you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course it is. Do you take me for a fool? He had the impudence to\nsend it me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope you had the decency to acknowledge it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think I have the time to acknowledge all the books\ntwopenny-halfpenny authors send me? I expect Glaser wrote to him. You\nhad no right to ask me to dinner to meet him. I came to oblige you,\nbecause I thought you liked me for myself, I didn't know I was just\nbeing made use of. It's awful that one can't trust one's oldest friends\nto behave like gentlemen. I'll never dine with you again so long as I\nlive. Never, never, never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was working herself into one of her tantrums, so I interrupted her\nbefore it was too late.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come off it, my dear,\" I said. \"In the first place the character of the\nsinger in that book, which I suppose is the one you're referring to...\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't suppose I'm referring to the charwoman, do you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, the character of the singer was roughed out before he'd even seen\nyou, and besides, it isn't in the least like you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How d'you mean, it's not like me? All my friends have recognised me. I\nmean, it's the most obvious portrait.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mary,\" I expostulated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My name is Maria and no one knows it better than you, and if you can't\ncall me Maria you can call me Madame Falterona or Princess.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI paid no attention to this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you read the book?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I read it. When everyone told me it was about me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But the boy's heroine, the prima donna, is twenty-five.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A woman like me is ageless.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's musical to her finger-tips, gentle as a dove, and a miracle of\nunselfishness; she's frank, loyal and disinterested. Is that the opinion\nyou have of yourself?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what is <i>your</i> opinion of me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hard as nails, absolutely ruthless, a born intriguer and as\nself-centred as they make 'em.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe then called me a name which a lady does not habitually apply to a\ngentleman who, whatever his faults, has never had his legitimacy called\nin question. But though her eyes flashed I could see that she was not in\nthe least angry. She accepted my description of her as complimentary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what about the emerald ring? Are you going to deny that I told him\nthat?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe story of the emerald ring was this: La Falterona was having a\npassionate love-affair with the Crown Prince of a powerful state and he\nhad made her a present of an emerald of immense value. One night they\nhad a quarrel, high words passed, and some reference being made to the\nring she tore it off her finger and flung it in the fire. The Crown\nPrince, being a man of thrifty habit, with a cry of consternation, threw\nhimself on his knees and began raking out the coals till he recovered\nthe ring. The Falterona watched him scornfully as he grovelled on the\nfloor. She didn't give much away herself, but she could not bear economy\nin others. She finished the story with these splendid words:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After that I <i>couldn't</i> love him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe incident was picturesque and had taken Peter's fancy. He had used it\nvery neatly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I told you both about that in the greatest confidence and I've never\ntold it to a soul before. It's a scandalous breach of confidence to have\nput it into a book. There are no excuses either for him or for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I've heard you tell the story dozens of times. And it was told me\nby Florence Montgomerie about herself and the Crown Prince Rudolf. It\nwas one of her favourite stories too. Lola Montez used to tell it about\nherself and the King of Bavaria. I have little doubt that Nell Gwyn told\nit about herself and Charles II. It's one of the oldest stories in the\nworld.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was taken aback, but only for an instant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't see anything strange in its having happened more than once.\nEveryone knows that women are passionate and that men are as mean as\ncat's-meat. I could show you the emerald if you liked. I had to have it\nreset, of course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"With Lola Montez it was pearls,\" I said ironically. \"I believe they\nwere considerably damaged.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pearls?\" She gave that brilliant smile of hers. \"Have I ever told you\nabout Benjy Riesenbaum and the pearls? You might make a story out of\nit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBenjy Riesenbaum was a person of great wealth, and it was common\nknowledge that for a long time he had been the Falterona's lover. In\nfact it was he who had bought her the luxurious little villa in which we\nwere now sitting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He'd given me a very handsome string in New York. I was singing at the\nMetropolitan, and at the end of the season we travelled back to Europe\ntogether. You never knew him, did you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, he wasn't bad in some ways, but he was insanely jealous. We had a\nrow on the boat because a young Italian officer was paying me a good\ndeal of attention. Heaven knows, I'm the easiest woman in the world to\nget on with, but I will not be bullied by any man. After all, I have my\nself-respect to think of. I told him where he got off, if you understand\nwhat I mean, and he slapped my face. On deck if you please. I don't mind\ntelling you I was mad. I tore the string of pearls off my neck and flung\nit in the sea. 'They cost fifty thousand dollars,' he gasped. He went\nwhite. I drew myself up to my full height. 'I only valued them because I\nloved you,' I said. And I turned on my heel.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You were a fool,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't speak to him for twenty-four hours. At the end of that time\nI had him eating out of my hand. When we got to Paris the first thing he\ndid was to go to Cartier's and buy me another just as good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe began to giggle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you say I was a fool? I'd left the real string in the bank in New\nYork, because I knew I was going back next season. It was an imitation\none that I threw in the sea.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe started to laugh, and her laugh was rich and joyous and like a\nchild's. That was the sort of trick that thoroughly appealed to her. She\nchortled with glee.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What fools men are,\" she gasped. \"And you, you thought I'd throw a real\nstring into the sea.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe laughed and laughed. At last she stopped. She was excited.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want to sing. Glaser, play an accompaniment.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA voice came from the drawing-room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't sing after all that food you walloped down.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shut up, you old cow. Play something, I tell you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was no reply, but in a moment Miss Glaser began to play the\nopening bars of one of Schumann's songs. It was no strain on the voice,\nand I guessed that Miss Glaser knew what she was doing when she chose\nit. La Falterona began to sing, in an undertone, but as she heard the\nsounds come from her lips and found that they were clear and pure she\nlet herself go. The song finished. There was silence. Miss Glaser had\nheard that La Falterona was in magnificent voice, and she sensed that\nshe wished to sing again. The prima donna was standing in the window,\nwith her back to the lighted room, and she looked out at the darkly\nshining sea. The cedar made a lovely pattern against the sky. The night\nwas soft and balmy. Miss Glaser played a couple of bars. A cold shiver\nran down my spine. La Falterona gave a little start as she recognised\nthe music, and I felt her gather herself together.\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"<i>Mild und leise wie er lächelt</i>\n<br>\n<i>Wie das Auge er öffnet.</i>\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nIt was Isolde's death song. She had never sung in Wagner, fearing the\nstrain on her voice, but this, I suppose, she had often sung in\nconcerts. It did not matter now that instead of an orchestral\naccompaniment she had only the thin tinkle of a piano. The notes of the\nheavenly melody fell upon the still air and travelled over the water. In\nthat too romantic scene, in that starry night, the effect was\nshattering. La Falterona's voice, even now, was exquisite in its\nquality, mellow and crystalline; and she sang with wonderful emotion, so\ntenderly, with such tragic, beautiful anguish that my heart melted\nwithin me. I had a most awkward lump in my throat when she finished, and\nlooking at her I saw that tears were streaming down her face. I did not\nwant to speak. She stood quite still looking out at that ageless sea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhat a strange woman! I thought then that I would sooner have her as she\nwas, with her monstrous faults, than as Peter Melrose saw her, a pattern\nof all the virtues. But then people blame me because I rather like\npeople who are a little worse than is reasonable. She was hateful, of\ncourse, but she was irresistible.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nA good many people were shocked when they read that Captain Forestier\nhad met his death in a forest fire when trying to save his wife's dog,\nwhich had been accidentally shut up in the house. Some said they never\nknew he had it in him; others said it was exactly what they would have\nexpected of him, but of these some meant it in one way and some in\nanother. After the tragic occurrence Mrs. Forestier found shelter in the\nvilla of some people called Hardy, whose acquaintance she and her\nhusband had but lately made. Captain Forestier had not liked them, at\nany rate he had not liked Fred Hardy, but she felt that if he had lived\nthrough that terrible night he would have changed his mind. He would\nhave realised how much good there was in Hardy notwithstanding his\nreputation, and like the great gentleman he was he would not have\nhesitated to admit that he had been mistaken. Mrs. Forestier did not\nknow how she could ever have kept her reason after the loss of the man\nwho was everything in the world to her but for the Hardys' wonderful\nkindness. In her immense distress their unfailing sympathy had been her\nonly consolation. They, who had been almost eye-witnesses of her\nhusband's great sacrifice, knew as did no one else how wonderful he had\nbeen. She could never forget the words dear Fred Hardy had used when he\nwas breaking the dreadful news to her. It was these words that had\nenabled her not only to bear the frightful disaster, but to face the\ndesolate future with the courage with which she well knew that brave\nman, that gallant gentleman, whom she had loved so well, would have\nwished her to face it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Forestier was a very nice woman. Kindly people often say that of a\nwoman when they can say nothing about her, and it has come to be looked\nupon as cold praise. I do not mean it as such. Mrs. Forestier was\nneither charming, beautiful nor intelligent; on the contrary she was\nabsurd, homely and foolish; yet the more you knew her, the more you\nliked her, and when asked why, you found yourself forced to repeat that\nshe was a very nice woman. She was as tall as the average man; she had a\nlarge mouth and a great hooked nose, pale-blue short-sighted eyes and\nbig ugly hands. Her skin was lined and weather-beaten, but she made up\nheavily, and her hair, which she wore long, was dyed golden, tightly\nmarcelled and elaborately dressed. She did everything she could to\ncounteract the aggressive masculinity of her appearance, and succeeded\nonly in looking like a vaudeville artist doing a female impersonation.\nHer voice was a woman's voice, but you were always expecting her, at the\nend of the number as it were, to break into a deep bass, and tearing off\nthat golden wig, discover a man's bald pate. She spent a great deal of\nmoney on her clothes, which she got from the most fashionable\ndressmakers in Paris, but though a woman of fifty she had an unfortunate\ntaste for choosing dresses that looked exquisite on pretty little\nmannequins in the flower of their youth. She always wore a great\nquantity of rich jewels. Her movements were awkward and her gestures\nclumsy. If she went into a drawing-room where there was a valuable piece\nof jade she managed to sweep it on the floor; if she lunched with you\nand you had a set of glasses you treasured she was almost certain to\nsmash one of them to atoms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYet this ungainly exterior sheltered a tender, romantic and idealistic\nsoul. It took you some time to discover this, for when first you knew\nher you took her for a figure of fun, and then when you knew her better\n(and had suffered from her clumsiness) she exasperated you; but when you\ndid discover it, you thought yourself very stupid not to have known it\nall the time, for then it looked out at you through those pale-blue,\nnear-sighted eyes, rather shyly, but with a sincerity that only a fool\ncould miss. Those dainty muslins and spring-like organdies, those\nvirginal silks, clothed not the uncouth body but the fresh, girlish\nspirit. You forgot that she broke your china and looked like a man\ndressed up as a woman, you saw her as she saw herself, as indeed she\nreally was if reality were visible, as a dear little thing with a heart\nof gold. When you came to know her you found her as simple as a child;\nshe was touchingly grateful for any attention you paid her; her own\nkindness was infinite, you could ask her to do anything for you, however\ntiresome, and she would do it as though by giving her the opportunity to\nput herself out you rendered her a service. She had a rare capacity for\ndisinterested love. You knew that never an unkind nor a malicious\nthought had once passed through her head. And having granted all that\nyou said over again that Mrs. Forestier was a very nice woman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nUnfortunately she was also a damned fool. This you discovered when you\nmet her husband. Mrs. Forestier was American and Captain Forestier was\nEnglish. Mrs. Forestier was born in Portland, Oregon, and had never been\nto Europe till the war of 1914, when, her first husband having recently\ndied, she joined a hospital unit and came to France. She was not rich by\nAmerican standards, but by our English ones in affluent circumstances.\nFrom the way the Forestiers lived I should guess that she had something\nlike thirty thousand dollars a year. Except that she undoubtedly gave\nthe wrong medicines to the wrong men, put on their bandages so that they\nwere worse than useless, and broke every utensil that was breakable, I\nam sure that she was an admirable nurse. I do not think she ever found\nwork too revolting for her to do it without hesitation; she certainly\nnever spared herself and was surely never out of temper; I have a notion\nthat many a poor wretch had cause to bless the tenderness of her heart,\nand it may be that not a few took the last bitter step into the unknown\nwith more courage because of the loving-kindness of her golden soul. It\nwas during the last year of the war that Captain Forestier came under\nher care, and soon after peace was declared they married. They settled\ndown in a handsome villa on the hills behind Cannes, and in a short time\nbecame conspicuous in the social life of the Riviera. Captain Forestier\nplayed bridge well and was a keen golfer. He was not a bad tennis player\neither. He had a sailing boat, and in the summer the Forestiers gave\nvery nice parties between the islands. After seventeen years of marriage\nMrs. Forestier still adored her good-looking husband, and you were\nunlikely to know her long without being told in that slow Western drawl\nof hers the full story of their courtship.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was a case of love at first sight,\" she said. \"He was brought in\nwhen I happened to be off duty, and when I came on and found him lying\nin one of my beds, oh, my dear, I felt such a pang in my heart, for a\nmoment I thought I'd been overworking and had strained it. He was the\nhandsomest man I'd ever seen in my life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Was he badly wounded?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, he wasn't exactly wounded. You know, it's a most extraordinary\nthing, he went all through the war, he was under fire for months at a\ntime, and of course he risked his life twenty times a day, he's one of\nthose men who simply doesn't know what fear is; but he never even got a\nscratch. He had carbuncles.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt seemed an unromantic ailment on which to start a passionate\nattachment. Mrs. Forestier was a trifle prudish, and though Captain\nForestier's carbuncles greatly interested her she always found it a\nlittle difficult to tell you exactly where they were.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They were right down at the bottom of his back, even farther really,\nand he hated to have me dress them. Englishmen are curiously modest,\nI've noticed that over and over again, and it mortified him terribly.\nYou'd have thought being on those terms, if you know what I mean, from\nour first acquaintance it would have made us more intimate. But somehow\nit didn't. He was very stand-offish with me. When I used to get to his\nbed on my round I was so breathless and my heart beat so I couldn't make\nout what was the matter with me. I'm not naturally a clumsy woman, I\nnever drop things or break anything; but you wouldn't believe it, when I\nhad to give Robert his medicine I used to drop the spoon and break the\nglass, I couldn't imagine what he must be thinking of me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was almost impossible not to laugh when Mrs. Forestier told you this.\nShe smiled rather sweetly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose it sounds very absurd to you, but you see I'd never felt that\nway before. When I married my first husband--well, he was a widower with\ngrown-up children, he was a fine man and one of the most prominent\ncitizens in the state, but somehow it was different.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And how did you eventually discover that you were in love with Captain\nForestier?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I don't ask you to believe me, I know it sounds funny, but the\nfact is that one of the other nurses told me, and as soon as she did of\ncourse I knew it was true. I was terribly upset at first. You see, I\nknew nothing about him. Like all Englishmen he was very reserved and for\nall I knew he had a wife and half a dozen children.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did you find out he hadn't?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I asked him. The moment he told me he was a bachelor I made up my mind\nthat by hook or by crook I was going to marry him. He suffered agonies,\npoor darling; you see, he had to lie on his face almost all the time,\nlying on his back was torture, and as to sitting down--well, of course\nhe couldn't even think of that. But I don't believe his agonies were\nworse than mine. Men like clinging silks and soft, fluffy things, you\nknow what I mean, and I was at such a disadvantage in my nurse's\nuniform. The matron, one of those New England spinsters, couldn't bear\nmake-up, and in those days I didn't make-up anyway; my first husband\nnever liked it; and then my hair wasn't as pretty as it is now. He used\nto look at me with those wonderful blue eyes of his, and I felt he must\nbe thinking I looked a perfect sight. He was very low and I thought I\nought to do all I could to cheer him up, so whenever I had a few minutes\nto spare I'd go and talk to him. He said he couldn't bear the thought of\na strong, husky chap like he was lying in bed week after week while all\nhis pals were in the trenches. You couldn't talk to him without\nrealising that he was one of those men who never feel the joy of life so\nintensely as when the bullets are whistling all round them, and the next\nmoment may be their last. Danger was a stimulant to him. I don't mind\ntelling you that when I used to write down his temperature on the chart\nI added a point or two so that the doctors should think him a little\nworse than he was. I knew he was doing his damnedest to get them to\ndischarge him, and I thought it only fair to him to make sure that they\nwouldn't. He used to look at me thoughtfully while I talked away and I\nknow he looked forward to our little chats. I told him that I was a\nwidow and had no one dependent on me, and I told him that I was thinking\nof settling down in Europe after the war. Gradually he thawed a little.\nHe didn't say much about himself, but he began to chaff me, he has a\ngreat sense of humour, you know, and sometimes I really began to think\nhe rather liked me. At last they reported him fit for duty. To my\nsurprise he asked me to dine with him on his last evening. I managed to\nget leave from the matron and we drove in to Paris. You can't imagine\nhow handsome he looked in his uniform. I've never seen anyone look so\ndistinguished. Aristocratic to his finger-tips. Somehow or other he\nwasn't in such good spirits as I'd expected. He'd been crazy to get back\nto the front.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Why are you so down to-night?' I asked him. 'After all, you've got\nyour wish at last.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I know I have,' he said. 'If for all that I'm a bit blue, can't you\nguess why?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I simply dared not think what he meant. I thought I'd better make a\nlittle joke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I'm not very good at guessing,' I said, with a laugh. 'If you want me\nto know you'd better tell me.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He looked down and I could see he was nervous.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You've been most awfully good to me,' he said. 'I can never begin to\nthank you for all your kindness. You're the grandest woman I've ever\nknown.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It upset me terribly to hear him say that. You know how funny\nEnglishmen are; he'd never paid me a compliment before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I've only done what any competent nurse would have,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Shall I ever see you again?' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'That's up to you,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hoped he didn't hear the tremble in my voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I hate leaving you,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I really could hardly speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Need you?' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'So long as my King and Country want me I am at their service.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Mrs. Forestier reached this point her pale blue eyes filled with\ntears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'But the war can't last for ever,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'When the war ends,' he answered, 'supposing a bullet hasn't put an end\nto me, I shan't have a penny. I don't even know how I shall set about\nearning my living. You're a very rich woman; I'm a pauper.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You're an English gentleman,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Will that matter very much when the world has been made safe for\ndemocracy?' he said bitterly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was just crying my eyes out by then. Everything he said was so\nbeautiful. Of course I saw what he meant. He didn't think it honourable\nto ask me to marry him. I felt he'd sooner die than let me think he was\nafter my money. He was a fine man. I knew that I wasn't worthy of him,\nbut I saw that if I wanted him I must go out and get him myself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It's no good pretending I'm not crazy about you, because I am,' I\nsaid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Don't make it harder for me,' he said hoarsely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought I should die, I loved him so much when he said that. It told\nme all I wanted to know. I stretched out my hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Will you marry me, Robert?' I said, very simply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Eleanor,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was then he told me that he'd loved me from the first day he ever\nsaw me. At first he hadn't taken it seriously, he thought I was just a\nnurse and perhaps he'd have an affair with me, and then when he found\nout that I wasn't that sort of woman and had a certain amount of money,\nhe made up his mind that he must conquer his love. You see, he thought\nthat marriage was quite out of the question.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nProbably nothing flattered Mrs. Forestier more than the idea that\nCaptain Forestier had wanted to have a slap and tickle with her. It was\ncertain that no one else had ever made dishonourable proposals to her,\nand though Forestier hadn't either, the conviction that he had\nentertained the notion was a never-failing source of satisfaction to\nher. When they were married Eleanor's relations, hard-bitten Western\npeople, had suggested that her husband should go to work rather than\nlive on her money, and Captain Forestier was all for it. The only\nstipulation he made was this:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There are some things a gentleman can't do, Eleanor. Anything else I'll\ndo gladly. God knows, I don't attach any importance to that sort of\nthing, but if one's a sahib one can't help it, and damn it all,\nespecially in these days, one does owe something to one's class.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEleanor thought he had done enough in risking his life for his country\nin one bloody battle after another during four long years, but she was\ntoo proud of him to let it be said that he was a fortune-hunter who had\nmarried her for her money, and she made up her mind not to object if he\nfound something to do that was worth his while. Unfortunately, the only\njobs that offered were not very important. But he did not turn them down\non his own responsibility.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's up to you, Eleanor,\" he told her. \"You've only got to say the word\nand I'll take it. It would make my poor old governor turn in his grave\nto see me do it, but that can't be helped. My first duty is to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEleanor wouldn't hear of it, and gradually the idea of his working was\ndropped. The Forestiers lived most of the year in their villa on the\nRiviera. They seldom went to England; Robert said it was no place for a\ngentleman since the war, and all the good fellows, white men every one\nof them, that he used to go about with when he was \"one of the boys\",\nhad been killed. He would have liked to spend his winters in England,\nthree days a week with the Quorn, that was the life for a man, but poor\nEleanor, she would be so out of it in that hunting set, he couldn't ask\nher to make the sacrifice. Eleanor was prepared to make any sacrifice,\nbut Captain Forestier shook his head. He wasn't as young as he had been,\nand his hunting days were over. He was quite satisfied to breed\nSealyhams and raise Buff Orpingtons. They had a good deal of land; the\nhouse stood on the top of a hill, on a plateau, surrounded on three\nsides by forest, and in front they had a garden. Eleanor said he was\nnever so happy as when he was walking round the estate in an old tweed\nsuit with the kennel-man, who also looked after the chickens. It was\nthen you saw in him all those generations of country squires that he had\nbehind him. It touched and amused Eleanor to see the long talks he had\nwith the kennel-man about the Buff Orpingtons; it was for all the world\nas if he were discussing the pheasants with his head keeper: and he\nfussed over the Sealyhams as much as if they had been the pack of hounds\nyou couldn't help feeling he would have been so much more at home with.\nCaptain Forestier's great-grandfather had been one of the bucks of the\nRegency. It was he who had ruined the family so that the estates had to\nbe sold. They had a wonderful old place in Shropshire, they'd had it for\ncenturies, and Eleanor, even though it no longed belonged to them, would\nhave liked to go and see it; but Captain Forestier said it would be too\npainful to him and would never take her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Forestiers entertained a good deal. Captain Forestier was a\nconnoisseur of wines and was proud of his cellar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"His father was well known to have the best palate in England,\" said\nEleanor, \"and he's inherited it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMost of their friends were Americans, French and Russians. Robert found\nthem on the whole more interesting than the English, and Eleanor liked\neverybody he liked. Robert did not think the English quite up to their\nmark. Most of the people he had known in the old days belonged to the\nshooting, hunting, and fishing set; they, poor devils, were all broke\nnow, and though, thank God, he wasn't a snob, he didn't half like the\nidea of his wife getting herself mixed up with a lot of <i>nouveaux\nriches</i> no one had ever heard of. Mrs. Forestier was not nearly so\nparticular, but she respected his prejudices and admired his\nexclusiveness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course he has his whims and fancies,\" she said, \"but I think it's\nonly loyal on my part to defer to them. When you know the sort of people\nhe comes from you can't help seeing how natural it is he should have\nthem. The only time I've ever seen him vexed in all the years we've been\nmarried was when once a gigolo came up to me in the Casino and asked me\nto dance. Robert nearly knocked him down. I told him the poor little\nthing was only doing his job, but he said he wasn't going to have a\ndamned swine like that even asking his wife to dance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCaptain Forestier had high moral standards. He thanked God that he\nwasn't narrow-minded, but one had to draw the line somewhere; and just\nbecause he lived on the Riviera he didn't see why he should hob-nob with\ndrunks, wastrels and perverts. He had no indulgence for sexual\nirregularities and would not allow Eleanor to frequent women of doubtful\nreputation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see,\" said Eleanor, \"he's a man of complete integrity; he's the\ncleanest man I've ever known; and if sometimes he seems a little\nintolerant you must always remember that he never asks of others what he\nisn't prepared to do himself. After all, one can't help admiring a man\nwhose principles are so high and who's prepared to stick to them at any\ncost.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Captain Forestier told Eleanor that such and such a man, whom you\nmet everywhere, and who you thought was rather pleasant, wasn't a pukkah\nsahib, she knew it was no good insisting. She knew that in her husband's\njudgment that finished him, and she was prepared to abide by it. After\nnearly twenty years of marriage she was sure of one thing, if of no\nother, and this was that Robert Forestier was the perfect type of an\nEnglish gentleman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And I don't know that God has ever created anything finer than that,\"\nshe said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe trouble was that Captain Forestier was almost too perfect a type of\nthe English gentleman. He was at forty-five (he was two or three years\nyounger than Eleanor) still a very handsome man, with his wavy, abundant\ngrey hair and his handsome moustache; he had the weather-beaten,\nhealthy, tanned skin of a man who is much in the open air. He was tall,\nlean and broad-shouldered. He looked every inch a soldier. He had a\nbluff, hearty way with him and a loud, frank laugh. In his conversation,\nin his manner, in his dress he was so typical that you could hardly\nbelieve it. He was so much of a country gentleman that he made you think\nrather of an actor giving a marvellous performance of the part. When you\nsaw him walking along the Croisette, a pipe in his mouth, in plus-fours\nand just the sort of tweed coat he would have worn on the moors, he\nlooked so like an English sportsman that it gave you quite a shock. And\nhis conversation, the way he dogmatised, the platitudinous inanity of\nhis statements, his amiable, well-bred stupidity, were all so\ncharacteristic of the retired officer that you could hardly help\nthinking he was putting it on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When Eleanor heard that the house at the bottom of their hill had been\ntaken by a Sir Frederick and Lady Hardy she was much pleased. It would\nbe nice for Robert to have as a near neighbour someone of his own class.\nShe made enquiries about them from her friends in Cannes. It appeared\nthat Sir Frederick had lately come into the baronetcy on the death of an\nuncle and was come to the Riviera for two or three years while he was\npaying off the death duties. He was said to have been very wild in his\nyouth, he was well on in the fifties when he came to Cannes, but now he\nwas respectably married, to a very nice little woman, and had two small\nboys. It was a pity that Lady Hardy had been an actress, for Robert was\napt to be a little stuffy about actresses, but everyone said that she\nwas very well-mannered and ladylike, and you would never have guessed\nshe had been on the stage. The Forestiers met her first at a tea-party\nto which Sir Frederick did not go, and Robert acknowledged that she\nseemed a very decent sort of person; so Eleanor, wishing to be\nneighbourly, invited them both to luncheon. A day was arranged. The\nForestiers had asked a good many people to meet them, and the Hardys\nwere rather late. Eleanor took an immediate fancy to Sir Frederick. He\nlooked much younger than she expected, he hadn't a white hair on his\nclose-cropped head; indeed there was about him something boyish that was\nrather attractive. He was slightly built, not as tall as she was; and he\nhad bright friendly eyes and a ready smile. She noticed that he wore the\nsame Guards tie that Robert sometimes wore; he was not nearly so\nwell-dressed as Robert, who always looked as though he had stepped out\nof a show-window, but he wore his old clothes as though it didn't much\nmatter what one wore. Eleanor could quite believe he had been a trifle\nwild as a young man. She was not inclined to blame him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must introduce my husband to you,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe called him. Robert was talking to some of the other guests on the\nterrace, and hadn't noticed the Hardys come in. He came forward and in\nhis affable, hearty way, with a grace that always charmed Eleanor, shook\nhands with Lady Hardy. Then he turned to Sir Frederick. Sir Frederick\ngave him a puzzled look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Haven't we met before?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRobert looked at him coolly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think so.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I could have sworn I knew your face.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEleanor felt her husband stiffen and at once realised that something was\ngoing wrong. Robert laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It sounds terribly rude, but to the best of my belief I've never set\neyes on you in my life. We may have run across one another in the war.\nOne met such hosts of fellers, then, didn't one? Will you have a\ncocktail, Lady Hardy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDuring luncheon Eleanor noticed that Hardy kept looking at Robert. He\nwas evidently trying to place him. Robert was busy with the women on\neither side of him and did not catch the glances. He was making efforts\nto entertain his neighbours; and his loud, ringing laugh rang through\nthe room. He was a wonderful host. Eleanor had always admired his sense\nof social duty; however dull the women were he was sitting next to he\ngave them of his best. But when their guests had gone Robert's gaiety\ndropped from him like a cloak from his shoulders. She had a feeling that\nhe was upset.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Was the princess very boring?\" she asked kindly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's a malignant old cat, but otherwise she was all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Funny that Sir Frederick thought he knew you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've never set eyes on him in my life. But I know all about him. I\nwouldn't have more to do with him than you can help if I were you,\nEleanor. I don't think he's quite our mark.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But it's one of the oldest baronetcies in England. We looked it out in\n<i>Who's Who</i>.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's a disreputable scamp. I didn't dream that the Captain Hardy,\"\nRobert corrected himself, \"the Fred Hardy I used to know about in the\nold days was now Sir Frederick. I would never have allowed you to ask\nhim to my house.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, Robert? I'm bound to tell you that I thought him very attractive.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor once Eleanor thought her husband rather unreasonable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A great many women have found him so, and a pretty penny it's cost\nthem.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know how people talk. One really can't believe everything one\nhears.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took one of her hands in his and looked earnestly into her eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Eleanor, you know I'm not the sort of chap to say anything against\nanother chap behind his back, and I'd rather not tell you what I know\nabout Hardy; I can only ask you to take my word for it that he isn't a\nproper person for you to know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis was an appeal to which Eleanor was incapable of turning a deaf ear.\nIt thrilled her to know that Robert placed such confidence in her; he\nknew that in a crisis he had only to call on her loyalty and she would\nnot fail him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No one can be better aware than I, Robert,\" she answered gravely, \"of\nyour perfect integrity; I know that if you could tell me you would, but\neven if you wanted to now I wouldn't let you; it would look as if I had\nless confidence in you than you have in me. I am willing to abide by\nyour judgment. I promise you that the Hardys shall never darken these\ndoors again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Eleanor often lunched out without Robert, when he was playing golf,\nand so frequently met the Hardys. She was very stiff with Sir Frederick,\nbecause if Robert disapproved of him, she must too; but he either did\nnot notice or did not care. He went out of his way to be nice to her and\nshe found him easy to get on with. It was difficult to dislike a man who\nplainly thought that no woman was better than she should be, but very\nsweet for all that, and who had such delightful manners. It might be\nthat he was an improper man for her to know, but she couldn't help\nliking the look in his brown eyes. It was a mocking look, which put you\non your guard, and yet so caressing that you could not think he meant\nyou harm. But the more Eleanor heard about him, the more she realised\nhow right Robert was. He was an unprincipled rascal. They mentioned the\nnames of women who had sacrificed everything for his sake and whom he\nhad thrown aside without ceremony the moment he was tired of them. He\nseemed to have settled down now, and to be devoted to his wife and\nchildren; but can the leopard change his spots? It was only too probable\nthat Lady Hardy had more to put up with than anyone suspected.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFred Hardy was a bad lot. Pretty women, <i>chemin de fer</i>, and an unlucky\nknack for backing the wrong horse had landed him in the bankruptcy court\nby the time he was twenty-five, and he had been forced to resign his\ncommission. He had seen no shame then in allowing women no longer in\ntheir first youth, who found his charm irresistible, to supply his\nwants. But the war came, he rejoined his regiment, and got a D.S.O. Then\nhe went out to Kenya, where he found occasion to become co-respondent in\na notorious divorce case; he left Kenya over some trouble with a cheque.\nHis ideas of honesty were lax. It was unsafe to buy a car or a horse off\nhim, and you did much better to keep away from the champagnes he warmly\nrecommended to you. When with his persuasive charm he put before you a\nspeculation by which you and he would make a fortune, you could only be\nsure that whatever he made out of it you would make nothing. He was in\nturn a motor-salesman, an outside broker, a commission agent and an\nactor. Were there any justice in the world he should have ended if not\nin gaol at least in the gutter. But by one of fate's monstrous tricks,\nhaving at last inherited his baronetcy and an adequate income, having\nmarried when well over forty a pretty, clever wife to whom were in due\ncourse born two healthy and handsome children, the future offered him\naffluence, position and respectability. He had never taken life any more\nseriously than he took women, and life had been as kind to him as women.\nIf he thought of his past it was with complacency; he had had a good\ntime, he had enjoyed his ups and downs; and now, with good health and a\nclear conscience, he was prepared to settle down as a country gentleman,\ndamn it, bring up the kids as kids should be brought up; and when the\nold buffer who sat for his constituency pegged out, by George, go into\nParliament himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I could tell them a thing or two they don't know,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was probably right, but he did not stop to reflect that perhaps they\nwere not things they much wanted to know.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne afternoon, about sunset, Fred Hardy went into one of the bars on the\nCroisette. He was a sociable creature and did not care to drink alone,\nso he looked around to see if there were anyone he knew. He caught sight\nof Robert, who had been playing golf and was waiting there for Eleanor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa, Bob, what about having a tiddly?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRobert gave a start. No one on the Riviera called him Bob. When he saw\nwho it was he answered stiffly:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got a drink, thanks.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have another. My old lady don't approve of my drinking between meals,\nbut when I can manage to get away from her I generally slip in and have\none about this time. I don't know what you think about it, but my\nfeeling is that God made six o'clock for man to have a drink at.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe flung himself into a great leather arm-chair next to the one Robert\nwas sitting in and called a waiter. He gave Robert his good-natured,\nengaging smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A lot of water has passed under the bridges since first we met, old\nboy, hasn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRobert, frowning a little, shot a look at him which an observer might\nhave described as wary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know exactly what you mean. To the best of my belief we met for\nthe first time three or four weeks ago when you and your wife were good\nenough to come and have lunch with us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come off it, Bob. I knew I'd seen you before. I was puzzled at first\nand then it flashed across me. You were the car-washer at that garage\noff Bruton Street where I used to keep my car.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCaptain Forestier gave a hearty laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry, but you've made a mistake. I never heard anything so\nridiculous.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got a damned good memory and I never forget a face. I bet you\nhaven't forgotten me either. Many's the half-crown I've given you for\nfetching the car away from my flat when I didn't want to be bothered to\nbring it round to the garage myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're talking absolute rot. I'd never seen you in my life till you\ncame to my house.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHardy grinned cheerfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know I've always been a Kodak-fiend. I've got albums of snaps that\nI've taken at one time and another. Would it surprise you to learn that\nI've found a snap of you standing by a two-seater I'd just bought? A\ndamned good-looking fellow you were in those days even though you had\noveralls on and your face was none too clean. Of course you've broadened\nout, your hair's grey and you've got a moustache, but it's the same\nchap. Unmistakably.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCaptain Forestier looked at him coolly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must have been misled by an accidental resemblance. It was somebody\nelse you gave your half-crowns to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, where were you then, if you weren't a car-washer at the Bruton\nGarage between 1913 and 1914?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was in India.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"With your regiment?\" asked Fred Hardy with another grin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was shooting.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You liar.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRobert flushed deeply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This isn't quite the place to choose for a scrap, but if you think I'm\ngoing to stay here to be insulted by a drunken swine like you, you're\nmistaken.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wouldn't you like to hear what else I know about you? You know how\nthings come back to one, and I've remembered quite a lot.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not in the least interested. I tell you that you're making an\nabsolute mistake. You're confusing me with somebody else.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he made no attempt to go.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You were a bit of a slacker even in those days. I remember once, when I\nwas going into the country early, I'd told you to have my car washed by\nnine and it wasn't ready, so I kicked up a row and old Thompson told me\nthen your father had been a pal of his and he'd taken you on out of\ncharity because you were down and out. Your father had been a wine\nwaiter at one of the clubs, White's or Brooks's, I forget which, and\nyou'd been a page-boy there yourself. You enlisted in the Coldstream\nGuards, if I remember right, and some chap bought you out and made you\nhis valet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's too fantastic,\" said Robert scornfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And I remember, when I was home on leave once and went to the garage,\nold Thompson told me you'd enlisted in the A.S.C. You weren't going to\ntake any more risks than you could help, were you? You've been drawing\nthe long bow a bit, haven't you, with all those stories I hear of your\ngallantry in the trenches? I suppose you did get a commission, or is\nthat a fake too?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I got a commission.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, a lot of funny people did in those days, but you know, old boy,\nif it was in the A.S.C. I wouldn't wear a Guards tie if I were you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCaptain Forestier instinctively put his hand up to his tie, and Fred\nHardy, watching him with his mocking eyes, was pretty sure that\nnotwithstanding his tan he went white.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's no business of yours what tie I wear.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't get snotty, old boy. There's no reason to get up on your hind\nlegs. I've got the goods on you, but I'm not going to give you away, so\nwhy don't you come clean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got nothing to come clean about. I tell you it's all an absurd\nmistake. And I should tell you that if I find that you've been spreading\nthese lying stories about me, I shall immediately start proceedings for\nslander.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Stow it, Bob. I'm not going to spread any stories. You don't think I\ncare? I think the whole thing's rather a lark. I've got no ill-feeling\ntowards you. I've been a bit of an adventurer myself; I admire you for\ncarrying off such a stupendous bluff. Starting as a page-boy and then\nbeing a trooper, a valet and a car-washer; and there you are, a fine\ngentleman, with a grand house, entertaining all the big bugs of the\nRiviera, winning golf tournaments, vice-president of the Sailing Club,\nand I don't know what all. You're It in Cannes and no mistake. It's\nstupendous. I've done some pretty rum things in my day, but the nerve\nyou must have; old boy, I take off my hat to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish I deserved your compliments. I don't. My father was in the\nIndian cavalry and I was at least born a gentleman. I may not have had a\nvery distinguished career, but I certainly have nothing to be ashamed\nof.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, come off it, Bob. I shan't split, you know, not even to my old\nlady. I never tell women anything that they don't know already. Believe\nme, I'd have got into even worse scrapes than I have if I hadn't made a\nrule of that. I should have thought you'd be glad to have someone around\nthat you could be yourself with. Isn't it a strain never to let up?\nSilly of you to keep me at arm's length. I haven't got anything on you,\nold boy. It's true I'm a bart and a landed proprietor now, but I've been\nin some pretty tight places in my time, and it's a wonder to me that\nI've kept out of gaol.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a wonder to a good many other people.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFred Hardy broke into a guffaw.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's one on me, old boy. All the same, if you don't mind my saying\nso, I think it was a bit thick your telling your wife I wasn't a proper\nperson for her to associate with.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never said anything of the sort.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh yes, you did. She's a grand old girl, but a bit garrulous, or am I\nmistaken?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not prepared to discuss my wife with a man like you,\" said Captain\nForestier, coldly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, don't be so damned gentlemanly with me, Bob. We're a couple of bums\nand that's all there is to it. We could have some grand times together\nif you'd only have a little sense. You're a liar, a humbug and a cheat,\nbut you seem to be very decent to your wife, and that's something in\nyour favour. She just dotes upon you, doesn't she? Funny, women are.\nShe's a very nice woman, Bob.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRobert's face grew red, he clenched his fist and half rose from his\nchair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damn you, stop talking about my wife. If you mention her name again I\nswear I'll knock you down.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh no, you won't. You're too great a gentleman to hit a feller smaller\nthan yourself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHardy had said these words mockingly, watching Robert, and quite ready\nto dodge if that great fist struck out; he was astounded at their\neffect. Robert sank back into his chair and unclenched his fist.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're right. But only a mean hound would trade on it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe reply was so theatrical that Fred Hardy began to chuckle, but then\nhe saw that the man meant it. He was deadly serious. Fred Hardy was no\nfool; he could hardly have lived for twenty-five years on his wits in\ntolerable comfort unless he had had them all about him. And now, in\namazement, staring at that heavy, powerful man, who looked so like the\ntypical English sportsman, sunk back in the chair, he had a sudden flash\nof comprehension. He was no common swindler who had got hold of a silly\nwoman to keep him in luxury and idleness. She was only a means to a\ngreater end. He had been captivated by an ideal and in pursuit of it had\nstuck at nothing. Perhaps the notion had come to him when he was a\npage-boy in a smart club; the members, with their lounging ease, their\ncasual manner, may have seemed very wonderful to him; and afterwards as\na trooper, as a valet, as a car-washer, the many men he ran across,\nbelonging to a different world and seen through a haze of hero-worship,\nhad filled him perhaps with admiration and envy. He wanted to be like\nthem. He wanted to be one of them. That was the ideal that haunted his\ndreams. He wanted--it was grotesque, it was pathetic--he wanted to be a\ngentleman. The war, with the commission it brought him, gave him his\nchance. Eleanor's money provided the means. That wretched fellow had\nspent twenty years pretending to be something the only value of which\nwas that it wasn't a pretence. That was grotesque too; that was\npathetic. Without meaning to, Fred Hardy uttered the thought that passed\nthrough his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor old chap,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nForestier looked at him quickly. He could not understand what those\nwords meant nor the tone in which they were said. He flushed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What d'you mean by that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing. Nothing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think we need continue this conversation. Apparently there's\nnothing I can say to persuade you that you're mistaken. I can only\nrepeat that there's not a word of truth in it. I am not the fellow you\nthink I am.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right, old boy, have it your own way.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nForestier called the waiter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you want me to pay for your drink?\" he asked icily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, old boy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nForestier somewhat grandly gave the waiter a note and told him to keep\nthe change, then without a word, without giving Fred Hardy another look,\nstalked out of the bar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey did not meet again till the night on which Robert Forestier lost\nhis life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe winter passed into spring, and the gardens on the Riviera were\nablaze with colour. The hillsides were primly gay with wild flowers. The\nspring passed into summer. In the towns along the Riviera the streets\nwere hot with a bright, eager heat that made the blood run faster; and\nwomen walked about in great straw hats and pyjamas. The beaches were\ncrowded. Men in trunks and women almost naked lay in the sun. In the\nevening the bars on the Croisette were thronged by a restless,\nchattering crowd as many-coloured as the flowers of spring. It had not\nrained for weeks. There had been several forest fires along the coast,\nand Robert Forestier in his hearty, joking way had several times said\nthat they would stand a pretty thin chance if they had a fire in their\nwoods. One or two people had advised him to cut down some of the trees\nat the back of his house; but he couldn't bear to: they had been in poor\ncondition when the Forestiers bought the place, but now that the dead\nwood had been cut away year by year, that they had been given air and\nkept clean of pests, they were magnificent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, it would be like having my leg chopped off to cut one of 'em down.\nThey must be the best part of a hundred years old.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn the fourteenth of July the Forestiers went over to a gala dinner at\nMonte Carlo, and they gave their staff leave to go to Cannes. It was the\nnational holiday, and in Cannes they danced in the open air under the\nplane trees, there were fireworks, and from far and near the people came\nin to have a good time. The Hardys had sent their servants out too, but\nthey were sitting at home, and their two little boys were in bed. Fred\nwas playing patience and Lady Hardy was working at a piece of tapestry\nto cover a chair. Suddenly there was a ring of the bell and a loud\nknocking on the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who the devil's that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHardy went to the door and found a boy who told him that fire had broken\nout in the Forestiers' woods. Some men had gone up from the village and\nwere fighting it, but they needed all the help they could get, and would\nhe come.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I'll come.\" He hurried back to his wife and told her. \"Wake\nthe kids and let them come up and see the fun. By George, after all this\ndrought it'll be a blaze.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe bolted out. The boy told him they had telephoned to the\npolice-station and they were going to send along the soldiers. Someone\nwas trying to get through to Monte Carlo and let Captain Forestier know.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It'll take him an hour to get here,\" said Hardy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs they ran they saw the glow in the sky, and when they came to the top\nof the hill, the leaping flames. There was no water and the only thing\nwas to try to beat them out. Already a number of men were at work. Hardy\njoined them. But you had no sooner beat out the flames in one bush than\nanother began to crackle and before you could look had turned into a\nfiery torch. The heat was terrific, and the workers, unable to support\nit, were slowly driven, back. A breeze was blowing, and the sparks were\ncarried from tree to bush. After weeks of drought everything was as dry\nas tinder, and the moment a spark fell the tree, the bush, went up in\nflames. If it had not been terrifying, it would have been awe-inspiring\nto see a great fir-tree, sixty feet high, blazing like match-wood. The\nfire roared like the fire in a factory furnace. The best way to put a\nstop to it was by cutting down trees and brushwood, but the men were\nfew, and but two or three had axes. The only hope was in the troops, who\nwere used to dealing with the forest fires, and the troops did not come.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Unless they get here soon we shall never save the house,\" said Hardy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe caught sight of his wife, who had come up with the two boys, and\nwaved to them. Already he was black with grime, and the sweat was\npouring down his face. Lady Hardy ran up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Fred, the dogs and the chickens.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By George, yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe kennels and the chicken-run were at the back of the house, in a\nclearing that had been cut in the woods, and the wretched animals were\nalready frantic with terror. Hardy let them out and they rushed to\nsafety. They could only be left to shift for themselves. They must be\nrounded up later. The blaze could be seen now from far away. But the\ntroops did not come, and the small body of helpers were powerless\nagainst the advancing flames.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If those damned soldiers don't get here soon the house is for it,\" said\nHardy. \"I think we'd better get what we can out of it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a stone house, but there were wooden verandahs all round it, and\nthey would burn like kindling. The Forestiers' servants had come by now.\nHe got them together, his wife gave a hand, and the two boys; they\ncarried out on to the lawn in front such things as were portable, linen\nand silver, clothes, ornaments, pictures, pieces of furniture. At last\nthe troops came, two lorry-loads of them, and set about systematically\ndigging trenches and felling trees. There was an officer in charge and\nHardy, pointing out the danger to the house, begged him first of all to\ncut down the trees that surrounded it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The house must look after itself,\" he said. \"I've got to prevent the\nfire spreading beyond the hill.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe lights of a car were seen speeding along the winding road, and a few\nminutes later Forestier and his wife sprang out of it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where are the dogs?\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've let them out,\" said Hardy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, it's you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt first in that filthy fellow, his face begrimed with soot and sweat,\nhe had not recognised Fred Hardy. He frowned angrily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought the house might catch. I've got everything out I could.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nForestier looked at the blazing forest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, that's the end of my trees,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The soldiers are working on the side of the hill. They're trying to\nsave the next property. We'd better go along and see if we can save\nanything.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll go. You needn't,\" Forestier cried irritably.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn a sudden Eleanor gave an anguished cry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, look. The house.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFrom where they stood they could see a verandah at the back suddenly\nburst into flames.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's all right, Eleanor. The house can't burn. It'll only get the\nwoodwork. Take my coat; I'm going along to help the soldiers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took off his dinner jacket and handed it to his wife.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll come with you,\" said Hardy. \"Mrs. Forestier, you'd better go along\nto where your things are. I think we've got everything out that's\nvaluable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank heaven, I was wearing most of my jewellery.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLady Hardy was a woman of sense.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Forestier, let's get the servants together and carry what we can\ndown to our house.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe two men walked towards where the soldiers were at work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's very decent of you to have got that stuff out of my house,\" said\nRobert, stiffly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not at all,\" answered Fred Hardy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey had not gone far when they heard somebody calling. They looked\nround and vaguely saw a woman running after them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Monsieur, Monsieur.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey stopped and the woman, her arms outstretched, rushed up. It was\nEleanor's maid. She was distraught.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>La petite Judy.</i> Judy. I shut her up when we went out. She's on heat.\nI put her in the servants' bathroom.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My God!\" cried Forestier.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Eleanor's dog. I must save her at any cost.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned round and started to run back to the house. Hardy caught hold\nof his arm to hold him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be a damned fool, Bob. The house is burning. You can't go into\nit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nForestier struggled to release himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me go, damn you. D'you think I'm going to let a dog be burned\nalive?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, shut up. This is no time for play-acting!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nForestier shook Hardy off, but Hardy sprang on him and seized him round\nthe middle. Forestier with his clenched fist hit Hardy in the face as\nhard as he could. Hardy staggered, releasing his hold, and Forestier hit\nhim again; Hardy fell to the ground.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You rotten bounder. I'll show you how a gentleman behaves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFred Hardy picked himself up slowly and felt his face. It hurt him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"God, the black eye I'm going to have to-morrow.\" He was shaken and a\ntrifle dazed. The maid suddenly broke into a storm of hysterical tears.\n\"Shut up, you slut,\" he cried crossly. \"And don't say a word to your\nmistress.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nForestier was nowhere to be seen. It was more than an hour before they\nwere able to get at him. They found him lying on the landing outside the\nbathroom, dead, with the dead Sealyham in his arms. Hardy looked at him\nfor a long time before speaking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You fool,\" he muttered between his teeth, angrily. \"You damned fool!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat imposture of his had paid him out at last. Like a man who cherishes\na vice till it gets a stranglehold on him so that he is its helpless\nslave, he had lied so long that he had come to believe his own lies. Bob\nForestier had pretended for so many years to be a gentleman that in the\nend, forgetting that it was all a fake, he had found himself driven to\nact as in that stupid, conventional brain of his he thought a gentleman\nmust act. No longer knowing the difference between sham and real, he had\nsacrificed his life to a spurious heroism. But Fred Hardy had to break\nthe news to Mrs. Forestier. She was with his wife, in their villa at the\nbottom of the hill, and she still thought that Robert was with the\nsoldiers cutting down trees and clearing the brushwood. He told her as\ngently as he could, but he had to tell her, and he had to tell her\neverything. At first it seemed as though she could not grasp the sense\nof what he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dead?\" she cried. \"Dead? My Robert?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen Fred Hardy, the rip, the cynic, the unscrupulous ruffian, took her\nhands in his and said the words that alone enabled her to bear her\nanguish.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Forestier, he was a very gallant gentleman.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nHe came back into the kitchen. The man was still on the floor, lying\nwhere he had hit him, and his face was bloody. He was moaning. The woman\nhad backed against the wall and was staring with terrified eyes at\nWilli, his friend, and when he came in she gave a gasp and broke into\nloud sobbing. Willi was sitting at the table, his revolver in his hand,\nwith a half empty glass of wine beside him. Hans went up to the table,\nfilled his glass and emptied it at a gulp.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You look as though you'd had trouble, young fellow,\" said Willi with a\ngrin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHans' face was blood-stained and you could see the gashes of five sharp\nfinger-nails. He put his hand gingerly to his cheek.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She'd have scratched my eyes out if she could, the bitch. I shall have\nto put some iodine on. But she's all right now. You go along.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. Shall I? It's getting late.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be a fool. You're a man, aren't you? What if it is getting late?\nWe lost our way.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was still light and the westering sun streamed into the kitchen\nwindows of the farm-house. Willi hesitated a moment. He was a little\nfellow, dark and thin-faced, a dress designer in civil life, and he\ndidn't want Hans to think him a cissy. He got up and went towards the\ndoor through which Hans had come. When the woman saw what he was going\nto do she gave a shriek and sprang forwards.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Non, Non</i>,\" she cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith one step Hans was in front of her. He seized her by the shoulders\nand flung her violently back. She tottered and fell. He took Willi's\nrevolver.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Stop still, both of you,\" he rasped in French, but with his guttural\nGerman accent. He nodded his head towards the door. \"Go on. I'll look\nafter them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWilli went out, but in a moment was back again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's unconscious.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what of it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't. It's no good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Stupid, that's what you are. <i>Ein Weibchen.</i> A woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWilli flushed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'd better be getting on our way.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHans shrugged a scornful shoulder.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll just finish the bottle of wine and then we'll go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was feeling at ease and it would have been pleasant to linger. He had\nbeen on the job since morning and after so many hours on his motor-cycle\nhis limbs ached. Luckily they hadn't far to go, only to Soissons--ten or\nfifteen kilometres. He wondered if he'd have the luck to get a bed to\nsleep in. Of course all this wouldn't have happened if the girl hadn't\nbeen a fool. They had lost their way, he and Willi, they had stopped a\npeasant working in a field and he had deliberately misled them, and they\nfound themselves on a side road. When they came to the farm they stopped\nto ask for a direction. They'd asked very politely, for orders were to\ntreat the French population well as long as they behaved themselves. The\ndoor was opened for them by the girl and she said she didn't know the\nway to Soissons, so they pushed in; then the woman, her mother, Hans\nguessed, told them. The three of them, the farmer, his wife and\ndaughter, had just finished supper and there was a bottle of wine on the\ntable. It reminded Hans that he was as thirsty as the devil. The day had\nbeen sweltering and he hadn't had a drink since noon. He asked them for\na bottle of wine and Willi had added that they would pay them well for\nit. Willi was a good little chap, but soft. After all, they were the\nvictors. Where was the French army? In headlong flight. And the English,\nleaving everything behind, had scuttled like rabbits back to their\nisland. The conquerors took what they wanted, didn't they? But Willi had\nworked at a Paris dressmaker's for two years. It's true he spoke French\nwell, that's why he had his present job, but it had done something to\nhim. A decadent people. It did a German no good to live among them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe farmer's wife put a couple of bottles of wine on the table and Willi\ntook twenty francs out of his pocket and gave it to her. She didn't even\nsay thank you. Hans' French wasn't as good as Willi's, but he could make\nhimself understood, and he and Willi spoke it together all the time.\nWilli corrected his mistakes. It was because Willi was so useful to him\nin this way that he had made him his friend, and he knew that Willi\nadmired him. He admired him because he was so tall, slim and\nbroad-shouldered, because his curly hair was so fair and his eyes so\nblue. He never lost an opportunity to practise his French, and he tried\nto talk now, but those three French people wouldn't meet him half-way.\nHe told them that he was a farmer's son himself and when the war was\nover was going back to the farm. He had been sent to school in Munich\nbecause his mother wanted him to go into business, but his heart wasn't\nin it, and so after matriculating he had gone to an agricultural\ncollege.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You came here to ask your way and now you know it,\" said the girl.\n\"Drink up your wine and go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had hardly looked at her before. She wasn't pretty, but she had fine\ndark eyes and a straight nose. Her face was very pale. She was plainly\ndressed, but somehow she didn't look quite like what she evidently was.\nThere was a sort of distinction about her. Ever since the war started\nhe'd heard fellows talk about the French girls. They had something the\nGerman girls hadn't. Chic, Willi said it was, but when he asked him just\nwhat he meant by that Willi could only say that you had to see it to\nunderstand. Of course he'd heard others say that they were mercenary and\nhard as nails. Well, they'd be in Paris in a week and he'd find out for\nhimself. They said the High Command had already arranged for houses for\nthe men to go to.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Finish your wine and let's go,\" said Willi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Hans was feeling comfortable and didn't want to be hurried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't look like a farmer's daughter,\" he said to the girl.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And so what?\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's a teacher,\" said her mother.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then you've had a good education.\" She shrugged her shoulders, but he\nwent on good-humouredly in his bad French. \"You ought to understand that\nthis is the best thing that has ever happened to the French people. We\ndidn't declare war. You declared war. And now we're going to make France\na decent country. We're going to put order into it. We're going to teach\nyou to work. You'll learn obedience and discipline.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe clenched her fists and looked at him, her eyes black with hatred.\nBut she did not speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're drunk, Hans,\" said Willi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm as sober as a judge. I'm only telling them the truth and they may\njust as well know it at once.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's right,\" she cried out, unable any longer to contain herself.\n\"You're drunk. Now go. Go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, you understand German, do you? All right, I'll go. But you must\ngive me a kiss first.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe took a step back to avoid him, but he seized her wrist.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Father,\" she cried. \"Father.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe farmer flung himself on the German. Hans let go of her and with all\nhis might hit him in the face. He crumpled up on the floor. Then, before\nshe could escape him, he caught the girl in his arms. She gave him a\nswinging blow on the cheek.... He chuckled grimly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is that how you take it when a German soldier wants to kiss you? You'll\npay for this.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith his great strength he pinioned her arms and was dragging her out of\nthe door, but her mother rushed at him and catching him by the clothes\ntried to pull him away. With one arm holding the girl close to him, with\nthe flat of his other hand he gave the woman a great push and she\nstaggered back to the wall.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hans, Hans,\" cried Willi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shut up, damn you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put his hands over the girl's mouth to stop her shrieking and carried\nher out of the room. That was how it had happened and you had to admit\nthat she'd brought it on herself. She shouldn't have slapped him. If\nshe'd given him the kiss he'd asked for he'd have gone away. He gave a\nglance at the farmer still lying where he had fallen and he could hardly\nhelp laughing at his funny face. There was a smile in his eyes when he\nlooked at the woman cowering against the wall. Was she afraid it was her\nturn next? Not likely. He remembered a French proverb.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>C'est le premier pas qui coûte.</i> There's nothing to cry about, old\nwoman. It had to come sooner or later.\" He put his hand to his hip\npocket and pulled out a wallet. \"Look, here's a hundred francs so that\nmademoiselle can buy herself a new dress. There's not much left of that\none.\" He placed the note on the table and put his helmet back on his\nhead. \"Let's go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey slammed the door behind them and got on their motorcycles. The\nwoman went into the parlour. Her daughter was lying on the divan. She\nwas lying as he had left her and she was weeping bitterly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThree months later Hans found himself in Soissons again. He had been in\nParis with the conquering army and had ridden through the Arc de\nTriomphe on his motor-cycle. He had advanced with the army first to\nTours and then to Bordeaux. He'd seen very little fighting. The only\nFrench soldiers he'd seen were prisoners. The campaign had been the\ngreatest spree he could ever have imagined. After the armistice he had\nspent a month in Paris. He'd sent picture postcards to his family in\nBavaria and bought them all presents. Willi, because he knew the city\nlike the palm of his hand, had stayed on, but he and the rest of his\nunit were sent to Soissons to join the force that was holding it. It was\na nice little town and he was comfortably billeted. Plenty to eat and\nchampagne for less than a mark a bottle in German money. When he was\nordered to proceed there it had occurred to him that it would be fun to\ngo and have a look at the girl he'd had. He'd take her a pair of silk\nstockings to show there was no ill-feeling. He had a good bump of\nlocality and he thought he would be able to find the farm without\ndifficulty. So one afternoon, when he had nothing to do, he put the silk\nstockings in his pocket and got on his machine. It was a lovely autumn\nday, with hardly a cloud in the sky, and it was pretty, undulating\ncountry that he rode through. It had been fine and dry for so long that,\nthough it was September, not even the restless poplars gave sign that\nthe summer was drawing to an end. He took one wrong turning, which\ndelayed him, but for all that he got to the place he sought in less than\nhalf an hour. A mongrel dog barked at him as he walked up to the door.\nHe did not knock, but turned the handle and stepped in. The girl was\nsitting at the table peeling potatoes. She sprang to her feet when she\nsaw the uniformed man.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What d'you want?\" Then she recognised him. She backed to the wall,\nclutching the knife in her hands. \"It's you. <i>Cochon.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't get excited. I'm not going to hurt you. Look. I've brought you\nsome silk stockings.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Take them away and take yourself off with them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be silly. Drop that knife. You'll only get hurt if you try to be\nnasty. You needn't be afraid of me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not afraid of you,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe let the knife fall to the floor. He took off his helmet and sat\ndown. He reached out with his foot and drew the knife towards him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shall I peel some of your potatoes for you?\" She did not answer. He\nbent down for the knife and then took a potato out of the bowl and went\nto work on it. Her face hard, her eyes hostile, she stood against the\nwall and watched him. He smiled at her disarmingly. \"Why do you look so\ncross! I didn't do you much harm, you know. I was excited, we all were,\nthey'd talked of the invincible French army and the Maginot line...\"\nhe finished the sentence with a chuckle. \"And the wine went to my head.\nYou might have fared worse. Women have told me that I'm not a\nbad-looking fellow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked him up and down scornfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Get out of here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not until I choose.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you don't go my father will go to Soissons and complain to the\ngeneral.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Much he'll care. Our orders are to make friends with the population.\nWhat's your name?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's not your business.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a flush in her cheeks now and her angry eyes were blazing. She\nwas prettier than he remembered her. He hadn't done so badly. She had a\nrefinement that suggested the city-dweller rather than the peasant. He\nremembered her mother saying she was a teacher. Because she was almost a\nlady it amused him to torment her. He felt strong and healthy. He passed\nhis hand through his curly blond hair, and giggled when he thought that\nmany girls would have jumped at the chance she had had. His face was so\ndeeply tanned by the summer that his eyes were startlingly blue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where are your father and mother?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Working in the fields.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm hungry. Give me a bit of bread and cheese and a glass of wine. I'll\npay.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave a harsh laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We haven't seen cheese for three months. We haven't enough bread to\nstay our hunger. The French took our horses a year ago and now the\nBoches have taken our cows, our pigs, our chickens, everything.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, they paid you for them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can we eat the worthless paper they gave us?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe began to cry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you hungry?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, no,\" she answered bitterly, \"we can eat like kings on potatoes and\nbread and turnips and lettuce. To-morrow my father's going to Soissons\nto see if he can buy some horse meat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Listen, Miss. I'm not a bad fellow. I'll bring you a cheese, and I\nthink I can get hold of a bit of ham.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want your presents. I'll starve before I touch the food you\nswine have stolen from us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'll see,\" he said good-humouredly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put on his hat, got up, and with an <i>Au revoir, mademoiselle</i>, walked\nout.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe wasn't supposed to go joy-riding round the country and he had to wait\nto be sent on an errand before he was able to get to the farm again. It\nwas ten days later. He walked in as unceremoniously as before and this\ntime he found the farmer and his wife in the kitchen. It was round about\nnoon and the woman was stirring a pot on the stove. The man was seated\nat table. They gave him a glance when he came in, but there was no\nsurprise in it. Their daughter had evidently told them of his visit.\nThey did not speak. The woman went on with her cooking, and the man, a\nsurly look on his face, stared at the oil-cloth on the table. But it\nrequired more than this to disconcert the good-humoured Hans.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Bonjour, la compagnie</i>,\" he said cheerfully. \"I've brought you a\npresent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe undid the package he had with him and set out a sizable piece of\ngruyère cheese, a piece of pork and a couple of tins of sardines. The\nwoman turned round and he smiled when he saw the light of greed in her\neyes. The man looked at the foodstuff sullenly. Hans gave him his sunny\ngrin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry we had a misunderstanding the first time I came here. But you\nshouldn't have interfered.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment the girl came in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you doing here?\" she cried harshly. Then her eyes fell on the\nthings he had brought. She swept them together and flung them at him.\n\"Take them away. Take them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut her mother sprang forward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Annette, you're crazy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I won't take his presents.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's our own food that they've stolen from us. Look at the sardines.\nThey're Bordeaux sardines.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe picked the things up. Hans looked at the girl with a mocking smile\nin his light blue eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Annette's your name, is it? A pretty name. Do you grudge your parents a\nlittle food? You said you hadn't had cheese for three months. I couldn't\nget any ham; I did the best I could.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe farmer's wife took the lump of meat in her hands and pressed it to\nher bosom. You felt that she could have kissed it. Tears ran down\nAnnette's cheeks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The shame of it,\" she groaned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, come now, there's no shame in a bit of gruyère and a piece of\npork.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHans sat down and lit a cigarette. Then he passed the packet over to the\nold man. The farmer hesitated for a moment, but the temptation was too\nstrong for him; he took one and handed back the packet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Keep it,\" said Hans. \"I can get plenty more.\" He inhaled the smoke and\nblew a cloud of it from his nostrils. \"Why can't we be friends? What's\ndone can't be undone. War is war, and, well, you know what I mean. I\nknow Annette's an educated girl and I want her to think well of me. I\nexpect we shall be in Soissons for quite a while and I can bring you\nsomething now and then to help out. You know, we do all we can to make\nfriends with the townspeople, but they won't let us. They won't even\nlook at us when we pass them in the street. After all, it was an\naccident, what happened that time I came here with Willi. You needn't be\nafraid of me. I'll respect Annette as if she was my own sister.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why do you want to come here? Why can't you leave us alone?\" asked\nAnnette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe really didn't know. He didn't like to say that he wanted a little\nhuman friendship. The silent hostility that surrounded them all at\nSoissons got on his nerves so that sometimes he wanted to go up to a\nFrenchman who looked at him as if he wasn't there and knock him down,\nand sometimes it affected him so that he was almost inclined to cry. It\nwould be nice if he had some place to go where he was welcome. He spoke\nthe truth when he said he had no desire for Annette. She wasn't the sort\nof woman he fancied. He liked women to be tall and full-breasted,\nblue-eyed and fair-haired like himself; he liked them to be strong and\nhefty and well-covered. That refinement which he couldn't account for,\nthat thin fine nose and those dark eyes, the long pale face--there was\nsomething intimidating about the girl, so that if he hadn't been excited\nby the great victories of the German armies, if he hadn't been so tired\nand yet so elated, if he hadn't drunk all that wine on an empty stomach,\nit would never have crossed his mind that he could have anything to do\nwith her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a fortnight after that Hans couldn't get away. He'd left the food at\nthe farm and he had no doubt that the old people had wolfed it. He\nwondered if Annette had eaten it too; he wouldn't have been surprised to\ndiscover that the moment his back was turned she had set to with the\nothers. These French people, they couldn't resist getting something for\nnothing. They were weak and decadent. She hated him, yes, God, how she\nhated him, but pork was pork and cheese was cheese. He thought of her\nquite a lot. It tantalised him that she should have such a loathing for\nhim. He was used to being liked by women. It would be funny if one of\nthese days she fell in love with him. He'd been her first lover and he'd\nheard the students at Munich over their beer saying that it was her\nfirst lover a woman loved, after that it was love. When he'd set his\nmind on getting a girl he'd never failed yet. Hans laughed to himself\nand a sly look came into his eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last he got his chance to go to the farm. He got hold of cheese and\nbutter, sugar, a tin of sausages, and some coffee, and set off on his\nmotor-cycle. But that time he didn't see Annette. She and her father\nwere at work in the fields. The old woman was in the yard and her face\nlit up when she saw the parcel he was bringing. She led him into the\nkitchen. Her hands trembled a little as she untied the string and when\nshe saw what he had brought her eyes filled with tears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're very good,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"May I sit down?\" he asked politely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course.\" She looked out of the window and Hans guessed that she\nwanted to make sure that Annette was not coming. \"Can I offer you a\nglass of wine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd be glad of it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was sharp enough to see that her greed for food had made her, if not\nfriendly to him, at least willing to come to terms with him. That look\nout of the window made them almost fellow conspirators.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you like the pork?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was a treat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll try to bring you some more next time I come. Did Annette like it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She wouldn't touch a thing you'd left. She said she'd rather starve.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Silly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's what I said to her. As long as the food is there, I said,\nthere's nothing to be gained by not eating it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey chatted quite amicably while Hans sipped his wine. He discovered\nthat she was called Madame Périer. He asked her whether there were any\nother members of the family. She sighed. No, they'd had a son, but he'd\nbeen mobilised at the beginning of the war and he'd died. He hadn't been\nkilled, he'd got pneumonia and died in the hospital at Nancy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Hans.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps he's better off than if he'd lived. He was like Annette in many\nways. He could never have borne the shame of defeat.\" She sighed again.\n\"Oh, my poor friend, we've been betrayed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why did you want to fight for the Poles? What were they to you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're right. If we had let your Hitler take Poland he would have left\nus alone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Hans got up to go he said he would come again soon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shan't forget the pork.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen Hans had a lucky break; he was given a job that took him twice a\nweek to a town in the vicinity so that he was able to get to the farm\nmuch oftener. He took care never to come without bringing something. But\nhe made no headway with Annette. Seeking to ingratiate himself with her,\nhe used the simple wiles that he had discovered went down with women;\nbut they only excited her derision. Thin-lipped and hard, she looked at\nhim as though he were dirt. On more than one occasion she made him so\nangry that he would have liked to take her by the shoulders and shake\nthe life out of her. Once he found her alone, and when she got up to go\nhe barred her passage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Stop where you are. I want to talk to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Talk. I am a woman and defenceless.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What I want to say is this: for all I know I may be here for a long\ntime. Things aren't going to get easier for you French, they're going to\nget harder. I can be useful to you. Why don't you be reasonable like\nyour father and mother?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was true that old Périer had come round. You couldn't say that he was\ncordial, he was indeed cold and gruff, but he was civil. He had even\nasked Hans to bring him some tobacco, and when he wouldn't accept\npayment for it had thanked him. He was pleased to hear the news of\nSoissons and grabbed the paper that Hans brought him. Hans, a farmer's\nson, could talk about the farm as one who knew. It was a good farm, not\ntoo big and not too small, well watered, for a sizable brook ran through\nit, and well wooded, with arable land and pasture. Hans listened with\nunderstanding sympathy when the old man bewailed himself because without\nlabour, without fertilisers, his stock taken from him, it was all going\nto rack and ruin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You ask me why I can't be reasonable like my father and mother,\" said\nAnnette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe pulled her dress tight and showed herself to him. He couldn't\nbelieve his eyes. What he saw caused such a convulsion in his soul as he\nhad never known. The blood rushed to his cheeks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're pregnant.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe sank back on her chair and leaning her head on her hands began to\nweep as though her heart would break.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The shame of it. The shame.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sprang towards her to take her in his arms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My sweet,\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut she sprang to her feet and pushed him away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't touch me. Go away. Go away. Haven't you done me enough harm\nalready?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe flung out of the room. He waited by himself for a few minutes. He\nwas bewildered. His thoughts in a whirl, he rode slowly back to\nSoissons, and when he went to bed he couldn't get to sleep for hours. He\ncould think of nothing but Annette and her swollen body. She had been\nunbearably pathetic as she sat there at the table crying her eyes out.\nIt was his child she bore in her womb. He began to feel drowsy, and then\nwith a start he was once more wide awake, for suddenly it came to him,\nit came to him with the shattering suddenness of gun-fire: he was in\nlove with her. It was such a surprise, such a shock that he couldn't\ncope with it. Of course he'd thought of her a lot, but never in that\nway, he'd thought it would be a great joke if he made her fall in love\nwith him, it would be a triumph if the time came when she offered what\nhe had taken by force; but not for a moment had it occurred to him that\nshe was anything to him but a woman like another. She wasn't his type.\nShe wasn't very pretty. There was nothing to her. Why should he have all\nof a sudden this funny feeling for her? It wasn't a pleasant feeling\neither, it was a pain. But he knew what it was all right; it was love,\nand it made him feel happier than he had ever felt in his life. He\nwanted to take her in his arms, he wanted to pet her, he wanted to kiss\nthose tear-stained eyes of hers. He didn't desire her, he thought, as a\nman desires a woman, he wanted to comfort her, he wanted her to smile at\nhim--strange, he had never seen her smile, he wanted to see her\neyes--fine eyes they were, beautiful eyes--soft with tenderness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor three days he could not leave Soissons and for three days, three\ndays and three nights, he thought of Annette and the child she would\nbear. Then he was able to go to the farm. He wanted to see Madame Périer\nby herself, and luck was with him, for he met her on the road some way\nfrom the house. She had been gathering sticks in the wood and was going\nhome with a great bundle on her back. He stopped his motor-cycle. He\nknew that the friendliness she showed him was due only to the provisions\nhe brought with him, but he didn't care; it was enough that she was\nmannerly, and that she was prepared to be so as long as she could get\nsomething out of him. He told her he wanted to talk to her and asked her\nto put her bundle down. She did as he bade. It was a grey, cloudy day,\nbut not cold.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know about Annette,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe started.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did you find out? She was set on your not knowing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She told me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That was a pretty job of work you did that evening.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know. Why didn't you tell me sooner?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe began to talk, not bitterly, not blaming him even, but as though it\nwere a misfortune of nature, like a cow dying in giving birth to a calf\nor a sharp spring frost nipping the fruit trees and ruining the crop, a\nmisfortune that human kind must accept with resignation and humility.\nAfter that dreadful night Annette had been in bed for days with a high\nfever. They thought she was going out of her mind. She would scream for\nhours on end. There were no doctors to be got. The village doctor had\nbeen called to the colours. Even in Soissons there were only two doctors\nleft, old men both of them, and how could they get to the farm even if\nit had been possible to send for them? They weren't allowed to leave the\ntown. Even when the fever went down Annette was too ill to leave her\nbed, and when she got up she was so weak, so pale, it was pitiful. The\nshock had been terrible, and when a month went by, and another month,\nwithout her being unwell she paid no attention. She had always been\nirregular. It was Madame Périer who first suspected that something was\nwrong. She questioned Annette. They were terrified, both of them, but\nthey weren't certain and they said nothing to Périer. When the third\nmonth came it was impossible to doubt any longer. Annette was pregnant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey had an old Citroën in which before the war Madame Périer had taken\nthe farm produce into the market at Soissons two mornings a week, but\nsince the German occupation they had had nothing to sell that made the\njourney worth while. Petrol was almost unobtainable. But now they got it\nout and drove into town. The only cars to be seen were the military cars\nof the Germans. German soldiers lounged about. There were German signs\nin the streets, and on public buildings proclamations in French signed\nby the Officer Commanding. Many shops were closed. They went to the old\ndoctor they knew, and he confirmed their suspicions. But he was a devout\nCatholic and would not help them. When they wept he shrugged his\nshoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not the only one,\" he said. \"<i>Il faut souffrir.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey knew about the other doctor too and went to see him. They rang the\nbell and for a long time no one answered. At last the door was opened by\na sad-faced woman in black, but when they asked to see the doctor she\nbegan to cry. He had been arrested by the Germans because he was a\nfreemason, and was held as a hostage. A bomb had exploded in a café\nfrequented by German officers and two had been killed and several\nwounded. If the guilty were not handed over before a certain date he was\nto be shot. The woman seemed kindly and Madame Périer told her of their\ntrouble.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The brutes,\" she said. She looked at Annette with compassion. \"My poor\nchild.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave them the address of a midwife in the town and told them to say\nthat they had come from her. The midwife gave them some medicine. It\nmade Annette so ill that she thought she was going to die, but it had no\nfurther effect. Annette was still pregnant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat was the story that Madame Périer told Hans. For a while he was\nsilent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's Sunday to-morrow,\" he said then. \"I shall have nothing to do. I'll\ncome and we'll talk. I'll bring something nice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We have no needles. Can you bring some?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll try.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe hoisted the bundle of sticks on her back and trudged down the road.\nHans went back to Soissons. He dared not use his motor-cycle, so next\nday he hired a push-bike. He tied his parcel of food on the carrier. It\nwas a larger parcel than usual because he had put a bottle of champagne\ninto it. He got to the farm when the gathering darkness made it certain\nthat they would all be home from work. It was warm and cosy in the\nkitchen when he walked in. Madame Périer was cooking and her husband was\nreading a <i>Paris-Soir</i>. Annette was darning stockings.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look, I've brought you some needles,\" he said, as he undid his parcel.\n\"And here's some material for you, Annette.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you?\" he grinned. \"You'll have to begin making things for the\nbaby.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's true, Annette,\" said her mother, \"and we have nothing.\" Annette\ndid not look up from her sewing. Madame Périer's greedy eyes ran over\nthe contents of the parcel. \"A bottle of champagne.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHans chuckled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll tell you what that's for presently. I've had an idea.\" He\nhesitated for a moment, then drew up a chair and sat down facing\nAnnette. \"I don't know quite how to begin. I'm sorry for what I did that\nnight, Annette. It wasn't my fault, it was the circumstances. Can't you\nforgive me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe threw him a look of hatred.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never. Why don't you leave me alone? Isn't it enough that you've ruined\nmy life?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, that's just it. Perhaps I haven't. When I knew you were going to\nhave a baby it had a funny effect on me. It's all different now. It's\nmade me so proud.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Proud?\" she flung at him viciously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want you to have the baby, Annette. I'm glad you couldn't get rid of\nit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How dare you say that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But listen to me. I've been thinking of nothing else since I knew. The\nwar will be over in six months. We shall bring the English to their\nknees in the spring. They haven't got a chance. And then I shall be\ndemobilised and I'll marry you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You? Why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe blushed under his tan. He could not bring himself to say it in\nFrench, so he said it in German. He knew she understood it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Ich liebe dich.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does he say?\" asked Madame Périer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He says he loves me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnnette threw back her head and broke into a peal of harsh laughter. She\nlaughed louder and louder and she couldn't stop and tears streamed from\nher eyes. Madame Périer slapped her sharply on both cheeks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't pay any attention,\" she said to Hans. \"It's hysteria. Her\ncondition, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnnette gasped. She gained control over herself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I brought the bottle of champagne to celebrate our engagement,\" said\nHans.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's the bitterest thing of all,\" said Annette, \"that we were beaten\nby fools, by such fools.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHans went on speaking in German.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know I loved you till that day when I found out that you were\ngoing to have a baby. It came like a clap of thunder, but I think I've\nloved you all the time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does he say?\" asked Madame Périer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing of importance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe fell back into French. He wanted Annette's parents to hear what he\nhad to say.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd marry you now, only they wouldn't let me. And don't think I'm\nnothing at all. My father's well-to-do and we're well thought of in our\ncommune. I'm the eldest son and you'd want for nothing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you a Catholic?\" asked Madame Périer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I'm a Catholic.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's something.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's pretty, the country where we live and the soil's good. There's not\nbetter farming land between Munich and Innsbruck, and it's our own. My\ngrandfather bought it after the war of '70. And we've got a car and a\nradio, and we're on the telephone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnnette turned to her father.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He has all the tact in the world, this gentleman,\" she cried\nironically. She eyed Hans. \"It would be a nice position for me, the\nforeigner from the conquered country with a child born out of wedlock.\nIt offers me a chance of happiness, doesn't it? A fine chance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPérier, a man of few words, spoke for the first time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. I don't deny that it's a fine gesture you're making. I went through\nthe last war and we all did things we wouldn't have done in peace time.\nHuman nature is human nature. But now that our son is dead, Annette is\nall we have. We can't let her go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought you might feel that way,\" said Hans, \"and I've got my answer\nto that. I'll stay here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnnette gave him a quick look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Madame Périer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got another brother. He can stay and help my father. I like this\ncountry. With energy and initiative a man could make a good thing of\nyour farm. When the war's over a lot of Germans will be settling here.\nIt's well known that you haven't got enough men in France to work the\nland you've got. A fellow gave us a lecture the other day at Soissons.\nHe said that a third of the farms were left uncultivated because there\naren't the men to work them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPérier and his wife exchanged glances and Annette saw that they were\nwavering. That was what they'd wanted since their son had died, a\nson-in-law who was strong and hefty and could take over when they grew\ntoo old to do more than potter about.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That changes the case,\" said Madame Périer. \"It's a proposition to\nconsider.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hold your tongue,\" cried Annette roughly. She leant forward and fixed\nher burning eyes on the German. \"I'm engaged to a teacher who worked in\nthe boys' school in the town where I taught, we were to be married after\nthe war. He's not strong and big like you, or handsome; he's small and\nfrail. His only beauty is the intelligence that shines in his face, his\nonly strength is the greatness of his soul. He's not a barbarian, he's\ncivilised; he has a thousand years of civilisation behind him. I love\nhim. I love him with all my heart and soul.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHans's face grew sullen. It had never occurred to him that Annette might\ncare for anyone else.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where is he now?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where do you suppose he is? In Germany. A prisoner and starving. While\nyou eat the fat of our land. How many times have I got to tell you that\nI hate you? You ask me to forgive you. Never. You want to make\nreparation. You fool.\" She threw her head back and there was a look of\nintolerable anguish on her face. \"Ruined. Oh, he'll forgive me. He's\ntender. But I'm tortured by the thought that one day the suspicion may\ncome to him that perhaps I hadn't been forced--that perhaps I'd given\nmyself to you for butter and cheese and silk stockings. I shouldn't be\nthe only one. And what would our life be with that child between us,\nyour child, a German child? Big like you, and blond like you, and\nblue-eyed like you. Oh, my God, why do I have to suffer this?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe got up and went swiftly out of the kitchen. For a minute the three\nwere left in silence. Hans looked ruefully at his bottle of champagne.\nHe sighed and rose to his feet. When he went out Madame Périer\naccompanied him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you mean it when you said you would marry her?\" she asked him,\nspeaking in a low voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. Every word. I love her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And you wouldn't take her away? You'd stay here and work on the farm?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I promise you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Evidently my old man can't last for ever. At home you'd have to share\nwith your brother. Here you'd share with nobody.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's that too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We never were in favour of Annette marrying that teacher, but our son\nwas alive then and he said, if she wants to marry him, why shouldn't\nshe? Annette was crazy about him. But now that our son's dead, poor boy,\nit's different. Even if she wanted to, how could she work the farm\nalone?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be a shame if it was sold. I know how one feels about one's\nown land.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey had reached the road. She took his hand and gave it a little\nsqueeze.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come again soon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHans knew that she was on his side. It was a comfort to him to think\nthat as he rode back to Soissons. It was a bother that Annette was in\nlove with somebody else. Fortunately he was a prisoner; long before he\nwas likely to be released the baby would be born. That might change her:\nyou could never tell with a woman. Why, in his village there'd been a\nwoman who was so much in love with her husband that it had been a joke,\nand then she had a baby and after that she couldn't bear the sight of\nhim. Well, why shouldn't the contrary happen too? And now that he'd\noffered to marry her she must see that he was a decent sort of fellow.\nGod, how pathetic she'd looked with her head flung back, and how well\nshe'd spoken! What language! An actress on the stage couldn't have\nexpressed herself better, and yet it had all sounded so natural. You had\nto admit that, these French people knew how to talk. Oh, she was clever.\nEven when she lashed him with that bitter tongue it was a joy to listen\nto her. He hadn't had a bad education himself, but he couldn't hold a\ncandle to her. Culture, that's what she had.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm a donkey,\" he said out loud as he rode along. She'd said he was big\nand strong and handsome. Would she have said that if it hadn't meant\nsomething to her? And she'd talked of the baby having fair hair and blue\neyes like his own. If that didn't mean that his colouring had made an\nimpression on her he was a Dutchman. He chuckled. \"Give me time.\nPatience, and let nature go to work.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe weeks went by. The C.O. at Soissons was an elderly, easy-going\nfellow and in view of what the spring had in store for them he was\ncontent not to drive his men too hard. The German papers told them that\nEngland was being wrecked by the Luftwaffe and the people were in a\npanic. Submarines were sinking British ships by the score and the\ncountry was starving. Revolution was imminent. Before summer it would be\nall over and the Germans would be masters of the world. Hans wrote home\nand told his parents that he was going to marry a French girl and with\nher a fine farm. He proposed that his brother should borrow money to buy\nhim out of his share of the family property so that he could increase\nthe size of his own holding while land, owing to the war and the\nexchange, could still be bought for a song. He went over the farm with\nPérier. The old man listened quietly when Hans told him his ideas: the\nfarm would have to be restocked and as a German he would have a pull;\nthe motor tractor was old, he would get a fine new one from Germany, and\na motor plough. To make a farm pay you had to take advantage of modern\ninventions. Madame Périer told him afterwards that her husband had said\nhe wasn't a bad lad and seemed to know a lot. She was very friendly with\nhim now and insisted that he should share their mid-day meal with them\non Sundays. She translated his name into French and called him Jean. He\nwas always ready to give a hand, and as time went on and Annette could\ndo less and less it was useful to have a man about who didn't mind doing\na job of work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnnette remained fiercely hostile. She never spoke to him except to\nanswer his direct questions and as soon as it was possible went to her\nown room. When it was so cold that she couldn't stay there she sat by\nthe side of the kitchen stove, sewing or reading, and took no more\nnotice of him than if he hadn't been there. She was in radiant health.\nThere was colour in her cheeks and in Hans's eyes she was beautiful. Her\napproaching maternity had given her a strange dignity and he was filled\nwith exultation when he gazed upon her. Then one day when he was on his\nway to the farm he saw Madame Périer in the road waving to him to stop.\nHe put his brakes on hard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've been waiting for an hour. I thought you'd never come. You must go\nback. Pierre is dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who's Pierre?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pierre Gavin. The teacher Annette was going to marry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHans's heart leapt. What luck! Now he'd have his chance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is she upset?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's not crying. When I tried to say something she bit my head off. If\nshe saw you to-day she's capable of sticking a knife into you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not my fault if he died. How did you hear?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A prisoner, a friend of his, escaped through Switzerland and he wrote\nto Annette. We got the letter this morning. There was a mutiny in the\ncamp because they weren't given enough to eat, and the ringleaders were\nshot. Pierre was one of them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHans was silent. He could only think it served the man right. What did\nthey think that a prison camp was--the Ritz?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give her time to get over the shock,\" said Madame Périer. \"When she's\ncalmer I'll talk to her. I'll write you a letter when you can come\nagain.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right. You will help me, won't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can be sure of that. My husband and I, we're agreed. We talked it\nover and we came to the conclusion that the only thing to do was to\naccept the situation. He's no fool, my husband, and he says the best\nchance for France now is to collaborate. And take it all in all I don't\ndislike you. I shouldn't wonder if you didn't make Annette a better\nhusband than that teacher. And with the baby coming and all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want it to be a boy,\" said Hans.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's going to be a boy. I know for certain. I've seen it in the coffee\ngrounds and I've put out the cards. The answer is a boy every time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I almost forgot, here are some papers for you,\" said Hans, as he turned\nhis cycle and prepared to mount.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe handed her three numbers of <i>Paris-Soir</i>. Old Périer read every\nevening. He read that the French must be realistic and accept the new\norder that Hitler was going to create in Europe. He read that the German\nsubmarines were sweeping the sea. He read that the General Staff had\norganised to the last detail the campaign that would bring England to\nher knees and that the Americans were too unprepared, too soft and too\ndivided to come to her help. He read that France must take the\nheaven-sent opportunity and by loyal collaboration with the Reich regain\nher honoured position in the new Europe. And it wasn't Germans who wrote\nit all; it was Frenchmen. He nodded his head with approval when he read\nthat the plutocrats and the Jews would be destroyed and the poor man in\nFrance would at last come into his own. They were quite right, the\nclever fellows who said that France was essentially an agricultural\ncountry and its backbone was its industrious farmers. Good sense, that\nwas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne evening, when they were finishing their supper, ten days after the\nnews had come of Pierre Gavin's death, Madame Périer, by arrangement\nwith her husband, said to Annette:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wrote a letter to Hans a few days ago telling him to come here\nto-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you for the warning. I shall stay in my room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, come, daughter, the time has passed for foolishness. You must be\nrealistic. Pierre is dead. Hans loves you and wants to marry you. He's a\nfine-looking fellow. Any girl would be proud of him as a husband. How\ncan we restock the farm without his help? He's going to buy a tractor\nand a plough with his own money. You must let bygones be bygones.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're wasting your breath, Mother. I earned my living before, I can\nearn my living again. I hate him. I hate his vanity and his arrogance. I\ncould kill him: his death wouldn't satisfy me. I should like to torture\nhim as he's tortured me. I think I should die happy if I could find a\nway to wound him as he's wounded me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're being very silly, my poor child.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your mother's right, my girl,\" said Périer. \"We've been defeated and we\nmust accept the consequences. We've got to make the best arrangement we\ncan with the conquerors. We're cleverer than they are and if we play our\ncards well we shall come out on top. France was rotten. It's the Jews\nand the plutocrats who ruined the country. Read the papers and you'll\nsee for yourself!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think I believe a word in that paper? Why do you think he brings\nit to you except that it's sold to the Germans? The men who write in\nit--traitors, traitors. Oh God, may I live to see them torn to pieces by\nthe mob. Bought, bought every one of them--bought with German money. The\nswine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMadame Périer was getting exasperated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What have you got against the boy? He took you by force--yes, he was\ndrunk at the time. It's not the first time that's happened to a woman\nand it won't be the last time. He hit your father and he bled like a\npig, but does your father bear him malice?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was an unpleasant incident, but I've forgotten it,\" said Périer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnnette burst into harsh laughter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You should have been a priest. You forgive injuries with a spirit truly\nChristian.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what is there wrong about that?\" asked Madame Périer angrily.\n\"Hasn't he done everything he could to make amends? Where would your\nfather have got his tobacco all these months if it hadn't been for him.\nIf we haven't gone hungry it's owing to him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you'd had any pride, if you'd had any sense of decency, you'd have\nthrown his presents in his face.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've profited by them, haven't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never. Never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a lie and you know it. You've refused to eat the cheese he brought\nand the butter and the sardines. But the soup you've eaten, you know I\nput the meat in it that he brought; and the salad you ate to-night, if\nyou didn't have to eat it dry, it's because he brought me oil.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnnette sighed deeply. She passed her hand over her eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know. I tried not to, I couldn't help myself, I was so hungry. Yes, I\nknew his meat went into the soup and I ate it. I knew the salad was made\nwith his oil. I wanted to refuse it; I had such a longing for it, it\nwasn't I that ate it, it was a ravenous beast within me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's neither here nor there. You ate it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"With shame. With despair. They broke our strength first with their\ntanks and their planes, and now when we're defenceless they're breaking\nour spirit by starving us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You get nowhere by being theatrical, my girl. For an educated woman you\nhave really no sense. Forget the past and give a father to your child,\nto say nothing of a good workman for the farm who'll be worth two hired\nmen. That is sense.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnnette shrugged her shoulders wearily and they lapsed into silence.\nNext day Hans came. Annette gave him a sullen look, but neither spoke\nnor moved. Hans smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you for not running away,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My parents asked you to come and they've gone down to the village. It\nsuits me because I want to have a definite talk with you. Sit down.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took off his coat and his helmet and drew a chair to the table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My parents want me to marry you. You've been clever; with your\npresents, with your promises, you've got round them. They believe all\nthey read in the papers you bring them. I want to tell you that I will\nnever marry you. I wouldn't have thought it possible that I could hate a\nhuman being as I hate you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me speak in German. You understand enough to know what I'm saying.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I ought to. I taught it. For two years I was governess to two little\ngirls in Stuttgart.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe broke into German, but she went on speaking French.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not only that I love you, I admire you. I admire your distinction\nand your grace. There's something about you I don't understand. I\nrespect you. Oh, I can see that you don't want to marry me now even if\nit were possible. But Pierre is dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't speak of him,\" she cried violently. \"That would be the last\nstraw.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I only want to tell you that for your sake I'm sorry he died.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shot in cold blood by his German jailers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps in time you'll grieve for him less. You know, when someone you\nlove dies, you think you'll never get over it, but you do. Won't it be\nbetter then to have a father for your child?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Even if there were nothing else do you think I could ever forget that\nyou are a German and I'm a Frenchwoman? If you weren't as stupid as only\na German can be you'd see that that child must be a reproach to me as\nlong as I live. Do you think I have no friends? How could I ever look\nthem in the face with the child I had with a German soldier? There's\nonly one thing I ask you; leave me alone with my disgrace. Go, go--for\nGod's sake go and never come again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But he's my child too. I want him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You?\" she cried in astonishment. \"What can a by-blow that you got in a\nmoment of savage drunkenness mean to you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't understand. I'm so proud and so happy. It was when I knew you\nwere going to have a baby that I knew I loved you. At first I couldn't\nbelieve it; it was such a surprise to me. Don't you see what I mean?\nThat child that's going to be born means everything in the world to me.\nOh, I don't know how to put it; it's put feelings in my heart that I\ndon't understand myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him intently and there was a strange gleam in her eyes.\nYou would have said it was a look of triumph. She gave a short laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know whether I more loathe the brutality of you Germans or\ndespise your sentimentality.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe seemed not to have heard what she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think of him all the time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've made up your mind it'll be a boy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know it'll be a boy. I want to hold him in my arms and I want to\nteach him to walk. And then when he grows older I'll teach him all I\nknow. I'll teach him to ride and I'll teach him to shoot. Are there fish\nin your brook? I'll teach him to fish. I'm going to be the proudest\nfather in the world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe stared at him with hard, hard eyes. Her face was set and stern. An\nidea, a terrible idea was forming itself in her mind. He gave her a\ndisarming smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps when you see how much I love our boy, you'll come to love me\ntoo. I'll make you a good husband, my pretty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe said nothing. She merely kept on gazing at him sullenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Haven't you one kind word for me?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe flushed. She clasped her hands tightly together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Others may despise me. I will never do anything that can make me\ndespise myself. You are my enemy and you will always be my enemy. I only\nlive to see the deliverance of France. It'll come, perhaps not next year\nor the year after, perhaps not for thirty years, but it'll come. The\nrest of them can do what they like, I will never come to terms with the\ninvaders of my country. I hate you and I hate this child that you've\ngiven me. Yes, we've been defeated. Before the end comes you'll see that\nwe haven't been conquered. Now go. My mind's made up and nothing on\nGod's earth can change it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was silent for a minute or two.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you made arrangements for a doctor? I'll pay all the expenses.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you suppose we want to spread our shame through the whole\ncountryside? My mother will do all that's necessary.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But supposing there's an accident?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And supposing you mind your own business!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sighed and rose to his feet. When he closed the door behind him she\nwatched him walk down the pathway that led to the road. She realised\nwith rage that some of the things he said had aroused in her heart a\nfeeling that she had never felt for him before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"O God, give me strength,\" she cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen, as he walked along, the dog, an old dog they'd had for years, ran\nup to him barking angrily. He had tried for months to make friends with\nthe dog, but it had never responded to his advances; when he tried to\npat it, it backed away growling and showing its teeth. And now as the\ndog ran towards him, irritably giving way to his feeling of frustration,\nHans gave it a savage, brutal kick and the dog was flung into the bushes\nand limped yelping away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The beast,\" she cried. \"Lies, lies, lies. And I was weak enough to be\nalmost sorry for him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a looking-glass hanging by the side of the door and she looked\nat herself in it. She drew herself up and smiled at her reflection. But\nrather than a smile it was a fiendish grimace.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was now March. There was a bustle of activity in the garrison at\nSoissons. There were inspections and there was intensive training.\nRumour was rife. There was no doubt they were going somewhere, but the\nrank and file could only guess where. Some thought they were being got\nready at last for the invasion of England, others were of opinion that\nthey would be sent to the Balkans, and others again talked of the\nUkraine. Hans was kept busy. It was not till the second Sunday afternoon\nthat he was able to get out to the farm. It was a cold grey day, with\nsleet that looked as though it might turn to snow falling in sudden\nwindy flurries. The country was grim and cheerless.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You!\" cried Madame Périer when he went in. \"We thought you were dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I couldn't come before. We're off any day now. We don't know when.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The baby was born this morning. It's a boy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHans's heart gave a great leap in his breast. He hung his arms round the\nold woman and kissed her on both cheeks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A Sunday child, he ought to be lucky. Let's open the bottle of\nchampagne. How's Annette?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's as well as can be expected. She had a very easy time. She began\nto have pains last night and by five o'clock this morning it was all\nover.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOld Périer was smoking his pipe sitting as near the stove as he could\nget. He smiled quietly at the boy's enthusiasm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One's first child, it has an effect on one,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He has quite a lot of hair and it's as fair as yours; and blue eyes\njust like you said he'd have,\" said Madame Périer. \"I've never seen a\nlovelier baby. He'll be just like his papa.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my God, I'm so happy,\" cried Hans. \"How beautiful the world is! I\nwant to see Annette.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know if she'll see you. I don't want to upset her on account of\nthe milk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, no, don't upset her on my account. If she doesn't want to see me it\ndoesn't matter. But let me see the baby just for a minute.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll see what I can do. I'll try to bring it down.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMadame Périer went out and they heard her heavy tread clumping up the\nstairs. But in a moment they heard her clattering down again. She burst\ninto the kitchen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're not there. She isn't in her room. The baby's gone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPérier and Hans cried out and without thinking what they were doing all\nthree of them scampered upstairs. The harsh light of the winter\nafternoon cast over the shabby furniture, the iron bed, the cheap\nwardrobe, the chest of drawers, a dismal squalor. There was no one in\nthe room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where is she?\" screamed Madame Périer. She ran into the narrow passage,\nopening doors, and called the girl's name. \"Annette, Annette. Oh, what\nmadness!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps in the sitting-room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey ran downstairs to the unused parlour. An icy air met them as they\nopened the door. They opened the door of a storeroom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's gone out. Something awful has happened.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How could she have got out?\" asked Hans sick with anxiety.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Through the front door, you fool.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPérier went up to it and looked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's right. The bolt's drawn back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my God, my God, what madness,\" cried Madame Périer. \"It'll kill\nher.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We must look for her,\" said Hans. Instinctively, because that was the\nway he always went in and out, he ran back into the kitchen and the\nothers followed him \"Which way?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The brook,\" the old woman gasped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe stopped as though turned to stone with horror. He stared at the old\nwoman aghast.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm frightened,\" she cried. \"I'm frightened.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHans flung open the door, and as he did so Annette walked in. She had\nnothing on but her nightdress and a flimsy rayon dressing, gown. It was\npink, with pale blue flowers. She was soaked, and her hair, dishevelled,\nclung damply to her head and hung down her shoulders in bedraggled\nwisps. She was deathly white. Madame Périer sprang towards her and took\nher in her arms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where have you been? Oh, my poor child, you're wet through. What\nmadness!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Annette pushed her away. She looked at Hans.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've come at the right moment, you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where's the baby?\" cried Madame Périer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I had to do it at once. I was afraid if I waited I shouldn't have the\ncourage.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Annette, what have you done?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've done what I had to do. I took it down to the brook and held it\nunder water till it was dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHans gave a great cry, the cry of an animal wounded to death; he covered\nhis face with his hands, and staggering like a drunken man flung out of\nthe door. Annette sank into a chair, and leaning her forehead on her two\nfists burst into passionate weeping.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI have always been convinced that if a woman once made up her mind to\nmarry a man nothing but instant flight could save him. Not always that;\nfor once a friend of mine, seeing the inevitable loom menacingly before\nhim, took ship from a certain port (with a tooth-brush for all his\nluggage, so conscious was he of his danger and the necessity for\nimmediate action) and spent a year travelling round the world; but when,\nthinking himself safe (women are fickle, he said, and in twelve months\nshe will have forgotten all about me), he landed at the selfsame port\nthe first person he saw gaily waving to him from the quay was the little\nlady from whom he had fled. I have only once known a man who in such\ncircumstances managed to extricate himself. His name was Roger Charing.\nHe was no longer young when he fell in love with Ruth Barlow and he had\nhad sufficient experience to make him careful; but Ruth Barlow had a\ngift (or should I call it a quality?) that renders most men defenceless,\nand it was this that dispossessed Roger of his commonsense, his prudence\nand his worldly wisdom. He went down like a row of ninepins. This was\nthe gift of pathos. Mrs. Barlow, for she was twice a widow, had splendid\ndark eyes and they were the most moving I ever saw; they seemed to be\never on the point of filling with tears; they suggested that the world\nwas too much for her, and you felt that, poor dear, her sufferings had\nbeen more than anyone should be asked to bear. If, like Roger Charing,\nyou were a strong, hefty fellow with plenty of money, it was almost\ninevitable that you should say to yourself: I must stand between the\nhazards of life and this helpless little thing, oh, how wonderful it\nwould be to take the sadness out of those big and lovely eyes! I\ngathered from Roger that everyone had treated Mrs. Barlow very badly.\nShe was apparently one of those unfortunate persons with whom nothing by\nany chance goes right. If she married a husband he beat her; if she\nemployed a broker he cheated her; if she engaged a cook she drank. She\nnever had a little lamb but it was sure to die.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Roger told me that he had at last persuaded her to marry him, I\nwished him joy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope you'll be good friends,\" he said. \"She's a little afraid of you,\nyou know; she thinks you're callous.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Upon my word I don't know why she should think that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You do like her, don't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's had a rotten time, poor dear. I feel so dreadfully sorry for\nher.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI couldn't say less. I knew she was stupid and I thought she was\nscheming. My own belief was that she was as hard as nails.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe first time I met her we had played bridge together and when she was\nmy partner she twice trumped my best card. I behaved like an angel, but\nI confess that I thought if the tears were going to well up into\nanybody's eyes they should have been mine rather than hers. And when,\nhaving by the end of the evening lost a good deal of money to me, she\nsaid she would send me a cheque and never did, I could not but think\nthat I and not she should have worn a pathetic expression when next we\nmet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRoger introduced her to his friends. He gave her lovely jewels. He took\nher here, there, and everywhere. Their marriage was announced for the\nimmediate future. Roger was very happy. He was committing a good action\nand at the same time doing something he had very much a mind to. It is\nan uncommon situation and it is not surprising if he was a trifle more\npleased with himself than was altogether becoming.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen, on a sudden, he fell out of love. I do not know why it could\nhardly have been that he grew tired of her conversation, for she had\nnever had any conversation. Perhaps it was merely that this pathetic\nlook of hers ceased to wring his heart-strings. His eyes were opened and\nhe was once more the shrewd man of the world he had been. He became\nacutely conscious that Ruth Barlow had made up her mind to marry him and\nhe swore a solemn oath that nothing would induce him to marry Ruth\nBarlow. But he was in a quandary. Now that he was in possession of his\nsenses he saw with clearness the sort of woman he had to deal with and\nhe was aware that, if he asked her to release him, she would (in her\nappealing way) assess her wounded feelings at an immoderately high\nfigure. Besides, it is always awkward for a man to jilt a woman. People\nare apt to think he has behaved badly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRoger kept his own counsel. He gave neither by word nor gesture an\nindication that his feelings towards Ruth Barlow had changed. He\nremained attentive to all her wishes; he took her to dine at\nrestaurants, they went to the play together, he sent her flowers; he was\nsympathetic and charming. They had made up their minds that they would\nbe married as soon as they found a house that suited them, for he lived\nin chambers and she in furnished rooms; and they set about looking at\ndesirable residences. The agents sent Roger orders to view and he took\nRuth to see a number of houses. It was very hard to find anything that\nwas quite satisfactory. Roger applied to more agents. They visited house\nafter house. They went over them thoroughly, examining them from the\ncellars in the basement to the attics under the roof. Sometimes they\nwere too large and sometimes they were too small; sometimes they were\ntoo far from the centre of things and sometimes they were too close;\nsometimes they were too expensive and sometimes they wanted too many\nrepairs; sometimes they were too stuffy and sometimes they were too\nairy; sometimes they were too dark and sometimes they were too bleak.\nRoger always found a fault that made the house unsuitable. Of course he\nwas hard to please; he could not bear to ask his dear Ruth to live in\nany but the perfect house, and the perfect house wanted finding.\nHouse-hunting is a tiring and a tiresome business and presently Ruth\nbegan to grow peevish. Roger begged her to have patience; somewhere,\nsurely, existed the very house they were looking for, and it only needed\na little perseverance and they would find it. They looked at hundreds of\nhouses; they climbed thousands of stairs; they inspected innumerable\nkitchens. Ruth was exhausted and more than once lost her temper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you don't find a house soon,\" she said, \"I shall have to reconsider\nmy position. Why, if you go on like this we shan't be married for\nyears.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't say that,\" he answered, \"I beseech you to have patience. I've\njust received some entirely new lists from agents I've only just heard\nof. There must be at least sixty houses on them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey set out on the chase again. They looked at more houses and more\nhouses. For two years they looked at houses. Ruth grew silent and\nscornful: her pathetic, beautiful eyes acquired an expression that was\nalmost sullen. There are limits to human endurance. Mrs. Barlow had the\npatience of an angel, but at last she revolted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you want to marry me or do you not?\" she asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was an unaccustomed hardness in her voice, but it did not affect\nthe gentleness of his reply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I do. We'll be married the very moment we find a house. By\nthe way, I've just heard of something that might suit us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't feel well enough to look at any more houses just yet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor dear, I was afraid you were looking rather tired.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRuth Barlow took to her bed. She would not see Roger and he had to\ncontent himself with calling at her lodgings to enquire and sending her\nflowers. He was as ever assiduous and gallant. Every day he wrote and\ntold her that he had heard of another house for them to look at. A week\npassed and then he received the following letter:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>\nRoger,\n<br>\n&nbsp;\n<br>\nI do not think you really love me. I have found someone who is\nanxious to take care of me and I am going to be married to him\nto-day.\n<br>\n&nbsp;\n<br>\nRuth.\n</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nHe sent back his reply by special messenger:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>Ruth,\n<br>\n&nbsp;\n<br>\nYour news shatters me. I shall never get over the blow, but of\ncourse your happiness must be my first consideration. I send you\nherewith seven orders to view; they arrived by this morning's\npost and I am quite sure you will find among them a house that\nwill exactly suit you.\n<br>\n&nbsp;\n<br>\nRoger.\n</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThey awaited their turn patiently, but patience was no new thing to\nthem; they had practised it, all three of them, with grim determination,\nfor thirty years. Their lives had been a long preparation for this\nmoment and they looked forward to the issue now, if not with\nself-confidence, for that on so awful an occasion would have been\nmisplaced, at all events with hope and courage. They had taken the\nstrait and narrow path when the flowery meads of sin stretched all too\ninvitingly before them; with heads held high, though with breaking\nhearts, they had resisted temptation; and now, their arduous journey\ndone, they expected their reward. There was no need for them to speak,\nsince each knew the others' thoughts, and they felt that in all three of\nthem the same emotion of relief filled their bodiless souls with\nthanksgiving. With what anguish now would they have been wrung if they\nhad yielded to the passion which then had seemed so nearly irresistible\nand what a madness it would have been if for a few short years of bliss\nthey had sacrificed that Life Everlasting which with so bright a light\nat long last shone before them! They felt like men who with the skin of\ntheir teeth have escaped a sudden and violent death and touch their feet\nand hands and, scarce able to believe that they are still alive, look\nabout them in amazement. They had done nothing with which they could\nreproach themselves and when presently their angels came and told them\nthat the moment was come, they would advance, as they had passed through\nthe world that was now so far behind, happily conscious that they had\ndone their duty. They stood a little on one side, for the press was\ngreat. A terrible war was in progress and for years the soldiers of all\nnations, men in the full flush of their gallant youth, had marched in an\ninterminable procession to the Judgment Seat; women and children too,\ntheir lives brought to a wretched end by violence or, more unhappily, by\ngrief, disease and starvation; and there was in the courts of heaven not\na little confusion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was on account of this war, too, that these three wan, shivering\nghosts stood in expectation of their doom. For John and Mary had been\npassengers on a ship which was sunk by the torpedo of a submarine; and\nRuth, broken in health by the arduous work to which she had so nobly\ndevoted herself, hearing of the death of the man whom she had loved with\nall her heart, sank beneath the blow and died. John, indeed, might have\nsaved himself if he had not tried to save his wife; he hated her; he had\nhated her to the depths of his soul for thirty years; but he had always\ndone his duty by her and now, in the moment of dreadful peril, it never\noccurred to him that he could do otherwise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last their angels took them by the hand and led them to the Presence.\nFor a little while the Eternal took not the slightest notice of them. If\nthe truth must be told he was in a bad humour. A moment before there had\ncome up for judgment a philosopher, deceased full of years and honours,\nwho had told the Eternal to his face that he did not believe in him. It\nwas not this that would have disturbed the serenity of the Kings of\nKings, this could only have made him smile; but the philosopher, taking\nperhaps an unfair advantage of the regrettable happenings just then upon\nEarth, had asked him how, considering them dispassionately, it was\npossible to reconcile his All-Power with his All-Goodness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No one can deny the fact of Evil,\" said the philosopher, sententiously.\n\"Now, if God cannot prevent Evil he is not all-powerful, and if he can\nprevent it and will not, he is not all-good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis argument was of course not new to the Omniscient, but he had always\nrefused to consider the matter; for the fact is, though he knew\neverything, he did not know the answer to this. Even God cannot make two\nand two five. But the philosopher, pressing his advantage, and, as\nphilosophers often will, drawing from a reasonable premise an\nunjustifiable inference--the philosopher had finished with a statement\nthat in the circumstances was surely preposterous.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will not believe,\" he said, \"in a God who is not All-Powerful and\nAll-Good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was not then perhaps without relief that the Eternal turned his\nattention to the three shades who stood humbly and yet hopefully before\nhim. The quick, with so short a time to live, when they talk of\nthemselves, talk too much; but the dead, with eternity before them, are\nso verbose that only angels could listen to them with civility. But this\nin brief is the story that these three recounted. John and Mary had been\nhappily married for five years and till John met Ruth they loved each\nother, as married couples for the most part do, with sincere affection\nand mutual respect. Ruth was eighteen, ten years younger than he was, a\ncharming, graceful animal, with a sudden and all-conquering loveliness;\nshe was as healthy in mind as she was in body, and, eager for the\nnatural happiness of life, was capable of achieving that greatness which\nis beauty of soul. John fell in love with her and she with him. But it\nwas no ordinary passion that seized them; it was something so\noverwhelming that they felt as if the whole long history of the world\nsignified only because it had led to the time and place that had brought\nthem together. They loved as Daphnis and Chloe or as Paolo and\nFrancesca. But after that first moment of ecstasy when each discovered\nthe other's love they were seized with dismay. They were decent people\nand they respected themselves, the beliefs in which they had been bred,\nand the society in which they lived. How could he betray an innocent\ngirl, and what had she to do with a married man? Then they grew\nconscious that Mary was aware of their love. The confident affection\nwith which she had regarded her husband was shaken; and there arose in\nher feelings of which she would never have thought herself capable,\njealousy and the fear that he would desert her, anger because her\npossession of his heart was threatened, and a strange hunger of the soul\nwhich was more painful than love. She felt that she would die if he left\nher; and yet she knew that if he loved it was because love had come to\nhim, not because he had sought it. She did not blame him. She prayed for\nstrength; she wept silent, bitter tears. John and Ruth saw her pine away\nbefore their eyes. The struggle was long and bitter. Sometimes their\nhearts failed them and they felt that they could not resist the passion\nthat burned the marrow of their bones. They resisted. They wrestled with\nevil as Jacob wrestled with the angel of God and at last they conquered.\nWith breaking hearts, but proud in their innocence, they parted. They\noffered up to God, as it were a sacrifice, their hopes of happiness, the\njoy of life and the beauty of the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRuth had loved too passionately ever to love again and with a stony\nheart she turned to God and to good works. She was indefatigable. She\ntended the sick and assisted the poor. She founded orphanages and\nmanaged charitable institutions. And little by little her beauty which\nshe cared for no longer left her and her face grew as hard as her heart.\nHer religion was fierce and narrow; her very kindness was cruel because\nit was founded not on love but on reason; she became domineering,\nintolerant and vindictive. And John resigned, but sullen and angry,\ndragged himself along the weary years waiting for the release of death.\nLife lost its meaning to him; he had made his effort and in conquering\nwas conquered; the only emotion that remained with him was the\nunceasing, secret hatred with which he looked upon his wife. He used her\nwith kindness and consideration; he did everything that could be\nexpected of a man who was a Christian and a gentleman. He did his duty.\nMary, a good, faithful and (it must be confessed) exceptional wife,\nnever thought to reproach her husband for the madness that had seized\nhim; but all the same she could not forgive him for the sacrifice he had\nmade for her sake. She grew acid and querulous. Though she hated herself\nfor it, she could not refrain from saying the things that she knew would\nwound him. She would willingly have sacrificed her life for him, but she\ncould not bear that he should enjoy a moment's happiness when she was so\nwretched that a hundred times she had wished she was dead. Well, now she\nwas and so were they; grey and drab had life been, but that was passed;\nthey had not sinned and now their reward was at hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey finished and there was silence. There was silence in all the courts\nof heaven. Go to hell were the words that came to the Eternal's lips,\nbut he did not utter them, for they had a colloquial association that he\nrightly thought unfitting to the solemnity of the occasion. Nor indeed\nwould such a decree have met the merits of the case. But his brows\ndarkened. He asked himself if it was for this that he had made the\nrising sun shine on the boundless sea and the snow glitter on the\nmountain tops; was it for this that the brooks sang blithely as they\nhastened down the hillsides and the golden corn waved in the evening\nbreeze?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I sometimes think,\" said the Eternal, \"that the stars never shine more\nbrightly than when reflected in the muddy waters of a wayside ditch.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the three shades stood before him and now that they had unfolded\ntheir unhappy story they could not but feel a certain satisfaction. It\nhad been a bitter struggle, but they had done their duty. The Eternal\nblew lightly, he blew as a man might blow out a lighted match, and,\nbehold! where the three poor souls had stood--was nothing. The Eternal\nannihilated them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have often wondered why men think I attach so much importance to\nsexual irregularity,\" he said. \"If they read my works more attentively\nthey would see that I have always been sympathetic to that particular\nform of human frailty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he turned to the philosopher, who was still waiting for a reply to\nhis remarks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You cannot but allow,\" said the Eternal, \"that on this occasion I have\nvery happily combined my All-Power with my All-Goodness.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI was prepared to dislike Max Kelada even before I knew him. The war had\njust finished and the passenger traffic in the ocean-going liners was\nheavy. Accommodation was very hard to get and you had to put up with\nwhatever the agents chose to offer you. You could not hope for a cabin\nto yourself and I was thankful to be given one in which there were only\ntwo berths. But when I was told the name of my companion my heart sank.\nIt suggested closed port-holes and the night air rigidly excluded. It\nwas bad enough to share a cabin for fourteen days with anyone (I was\ngoing from San Francisco to Yokohama), but I should have looked upon it\nwith less dismay if my fellow-passenger's name had been Smith or Brown.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen I went on board I found Mr. Kelada's luggage already below. I did\nnot like the look of it; there were too many labels on the suitcases,\nand the wardrobe trunk was too big. He had unpacked his toilet things,\nand I observed that he was a patron of the excellent Monsieur Coty; for\nI saw on the washing-stand his scent, his hair-wash and his\nbrilliantine. Mr. Kelada's brushes, ebony with his monogram in gold,\nwould have been all the better for a scrub. I did not at all like Mr.\nKelada. I made my way into the smoking-room. I called for a pack of\ncards and began to play patience. I had scarcely started before a man\ncame up to me and asked me if he was right in thinking my name was\nso-and-so.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am Mr. Kelada,\" he added, with a smile that showed a row of flashing\nteeth, and sat down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, yes, we're sharing a cabin, I think.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bit of luck, I call it. You never know who you're going to be put in\nwith. I was jolly glad when I heard you were English. I'm all for us\nEnglish sticking together when we're abroad, if you understand what I\nmean.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI blinked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you English?\" I asked, perhaps tactlessly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Rather. You don't think I look like an American, do you? British to the\nbackbone, that's what I am.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo prove it, Mr. Kelada took out of his pocket a passport and airily\nwaved it under my nose.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKing George has many strange subjects. Mr. Kelada was short and of a\nsturdy build, clean-shaven and dark-skinned, with a fleshy, hooked nose\nand very large, lustrous and liquid eyes. His long black hair was sleek\nand curly. He spoke with a fluency in which there was nothing English\nand his gestures were exuberant. I felt pretty sure that a closer\ninspection of that British passport would have betrayed the fact that\nMr. Kelada was born under a bluer sky than is generally seen in England.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What will you have?\" he asked me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI looked at him doubtfully. Prohibition was in force and to all\nappearances the ship was bone-dry. When I am not thirsty I do not know\nwhich I dislike more, ginger-ale or lemon-squash. But Mr. Kelada flashed\nan oriental smile at me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Whisky and soda or a dry Martini, you have only to say the word.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFrom each of his hip-pockets he fished a flask and laid them on the\ntable before me. I chose the Martini, and calling the steward he ordered\na tumbler of ice and a couple of glasses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A very good cocktail,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, there are plenty more where that came from, and if you've got any\nfriends on board, you tell them you've got a pal who's got all the\nliquor in the world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Kelada was chatty. He talked of New York and of San Francisco. He\ndiscussed plays, pictures, and politics. He was patriotic. The Union\nJack is an impressive piece of drapery, but when it is flourished by a\ngentleman from Alexandria or Beirut, I cannot but feel that it loses\nsomewhat in dignity. Mr. Kelada was familiar. I do not wish to put on\nairs, but I cannot help feeling that it is seemly in a total stranger to\nput mister before my name when he addresses me. Mr. Kelada, doubtless to\nset me at my ease, used no such formality. I did not like Mr. Kelada. I\nhad put aside the cards when he sat down, but now, thinking that for\nthis first occasion our conversation had lasted long enough, I went on\nwith my game.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The three on the four,\" said Mr. Kelada.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere is nothing more exasperating when you are playing patience than to\nbe told where to put the card you have turned up before you have had a\nchance to look for yourself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's coming out, it's coming out,\" he cried. \"The ten on the knave.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith rage and hatred in my heart I finished. Then he seized the pack.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you like card tricks?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I hate card tricks,\" I answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'll just show you this one.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe showed me three. Then I said I would go down to the dining-room and\nget my seat at table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" he said. \"I've already taken a seat for you. I\nthought that as we were in the same state-room we might just as well sit\nat the same table.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not like Mr. Kelada.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI not only shared a cabin with him and ate three meals a day at the same\ntable, but I could not walk round the deck without his joining me. It\nwas impossible to snub him. It never occurred to him that he was not\nwanted. He was certain that you were as glad to see him as he was to see\nyou. In your own house you might have kicked him downstairs and slammed\nthe door in his face without the suspicion dawning on him that he was\nnot a welcome visitor. He was a good mixer, and in three days knew\neveryone on board. He ran everything. He managed the sweeps, conducted\nthe auctions, collected money for prizes at the sports, got up quoit and\ngolf matches, organised the concert and arranged the fancy dress ball.\nHe was everywhere and always. He was certainly the best-hated man in the\nship. We called him Mr. Know-All, even to his face. He took it as a\ncompliment. But it was at meal times that he was most intolerable. For\nthe better part of an hour then he had us at his mercy. He was hearty,\njovial, loquacious and argumentative. He knew everything better than\nanybody else, and it was an affront to his overweening vanity that you\nshould disagree with him. He would not drop a subject, however\nunimportant, till he had brought you round to his way of thinking. The\npossibility that he could be mistaken never occurred to him. He was the\nchap who knew. We sat at the doctor's table. Mr. Kelada would certainly\nhave had it all his own way, for the doctor was lazy and I was frigidly\nindifferent, except for a man called Ramsay who sat there also. He was\nas dogmatic as Mr. Kelada and resented bitterly the Levantine's\ncocksureness. The discussions they had were acrimonious and\ninterminable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRamsay was in the American Consular Service, and was stationed at Kobe.\nHe was a great heavy fellow from the Middle West, with loose fat under a\ntight skin, and he bulged out of his ready-made clothes. He was on his\nway back to resume his post, having been on a flying visit to New York\nto fetch his wife, who had been spending a year at home. Mrs. Ramsay was\na very pretty little thing, with pleasant manners and a sense of humour.\nThe Consular Service is ill paid, and she was dressed always very\nsimply; but she knew how to wear her clothes. She achieved an effect of\nquiet distinction. I should not have paid any particular attention to\nher but that she possessed a quality that may be common enough in women,\nbut nowadays is not obvious in their demeanour. You could not look at\nher without being struck by her modesty. It shone in her like a flower\non a coat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne evening at dinner the conversation by chance drifted to the subject\nof pearls. There had been in the papers a good deal of talk about the\nculture pearls which the cunning Japanese were making, and the doctor\nremarked that they must inevitably diminish the value of real ones. They\nwere very good already; they would soon be perfect. Mr. Kelada, as was\nhis habit, rushed the new topic. He told us all that was to be known\nabout pearls. I do not believe Ramsay knew anything about them at all,\nbut he could not resist the opportunity to have a fling at the\nLevantine, and in five minutes we were in the middle of a heated\nargument. I had seen Mr. Kelada vehement and voluble before, but never\nso voluble and vehement as now. At last something that Ramsay said stung\nhim, for he thumped the table and shouted:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I ought to know what I am talking about. I'm going to Japan just\nto look into this Japanese pearl business. I'm in the trade and there's\nnot a man in it who won't tell you that what I say about pearls goes. I\nknow all the best pearls in the world, and what I don't know about\npearls isn't worth knowing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHere was news for us, for Mr. Kelada, with all his loquacity, had never\ntold anyone what his business was. We only knew vaguely that he was\ngoing to Japan on some commercial errand. He looked round the table\ntriumphantly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They'll never be able to get a culture pearl that an expert like me\ncan't tell with half an eye.\" He pointed to a chain that Mrs. Ramsay\nwore. \"You take my word for it, Mrs. Ramsay, that chain you're wearing\nwill never be worth a cent less than it is now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Ramsay in her modest way flushed a little and slipped the chain\ninside her dress. Ramsay leaned forward. He gave us all a look and a\nsmile flickered in his eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's a pretty chain of Mrs. Ramsay's, isn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I noticed it at once,\" answered Mr. Kelada. \"Gee, I said to myself,\nthose are pearls all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't buy it myself, of course. I'd be interested to know how much\nyou think it cost.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, in the trade somewhere round fifteen thousand dollars. But if it\nwas bought on Fifth Avenue I shouldn't be surprised to hear that\nanything up to thirty thousand was paid for it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRamsay smiled grimly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll be surprised to hear that Mrs. Ramsay bought that string at a\ndepartment store the day before we left New York, for eighteen dollars.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Kelada flushed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Rot. It's not only real, but it's as fine a string for its size as I've\never seen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you bet on it? I'll bet you a hundred dollars it's imitation.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Done.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Elmer, you can't bet on a certainty,\" said Mrs. Ramsay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe had a little smile on her lips and her tone was gently deprecating.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can't I? If I get a chance of easy money like that I should be all\nsorts of a fool not to take it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But how can it be proved?\" she continued. \"It's only my word against\nMr. Kelada's.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me look at the chain, and if it's imitation I'll tell you quickly\nenough. I can afford to lose a hundred dollars,\" said Mr. Kelada.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Take it off, dear. Let the gentleman look at it as much as he wants.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Ramsay hesitated a moment. She put her hands to the clasp.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't undo it,\" she said. \"Mr. Kelada will just have to take my word\nfor it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had a sudden suspicion that something unfortunate was about to occur,\nbut I could think of nothing to say.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRamsay jumped up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll undo it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe handed the chain to Mr. Kelada. The Levantine took a magnifying glass\nfrom his pocket and closely examined it. A smile of triumph spread over\nhis smooth and swarthy face. He handed back the chain. He was about to\nspeak. Suddenly he caught sight of Mrs. Ramsay's face. It was so white\nthat she looked as though she were about to faint. She was staring at\nhim with wide and terrified eyes. They held a desperate appeal; it was\nso clear that I wondered why her husband did not see it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Kelada stopped with his mouth open. He flushed deeply. You could\nalmost <i>see</i> the effort he was making over himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was mistaken,\" he said. \"It's a very good imitation, but of course as\nsoon as I looked through my glass I saw that it wasn't real. I think\neighteen dollars is just about as much as the damned thing's worth.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took out his pocket-book and from it a hundred-dollar note. He handed\nit to Ramsay without a word.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps that'll teach you not to be so cocksure another time, my young\nfriend,\" said Ramsay as he took the note.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI noticed that Mr. Kelada's hands were trembling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe story spread over the ship as stories do, and he had to put up with\na good deal of chaff that evening. It was a fine joke that Mr. Know-All\nhad been caught out. But Mrs. Ramsay retired to her state-room with a\nheadache.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext morning I got up and began to shave. Mr. Kelada lay on his bed\nsmoking a cigarette. Suddenly there was a small scraping sound and I saw\na letter pushed under the door. I opened the door and looked out. There\nwas nobody there. I picked up the letter and saw that it was addressed\nto Max Kelada. The name was written in block letters. I handed it to\nhim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who's this from?\" He opened it. \"Oh!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took out of the envelope, not a letter, but a hundred-dollar note. He\nlooked at me and again he reddened. He tore the envelope into little\nbits and gave them to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mind just throwing them out of the port-hole?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did as he asked, and then I looked at him with a smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No one likes being made to look a perfect damned fool,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Were the pearls real?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If I had a pretty little wife I shouldn't let her spend a year in New\nYork while I stayed at Kobe,\" said he.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment I did not entirely dislike Mr. Kelada. He reached out for\nhis pocket-book and carefully put in it the hundred-dollar note.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nIt is a dangerous thing to order the lives of others and I have often\nwondered at the self-confidence of politicians, reformers and suchlike\nwho are prepared to force upon their fellows measures that must alter\ntheir manners, habits and points of view. I have always hesitated to\ngive advice, for how can one advise another how to act unless one knows\nthat other as well as one knows oneself? Heaven knows, I know little\nenough of myself: I know nothing of others. We can only guess at the\nthoughts and emotions of our neighbours. Each one of us is a prisoner in\na solitary tower and he communicates with the other prisoners, who form\nmankind, by conventional signs that have not quite the same meaning for\nthem as for himself. And life, unfortunately, is something that you can\nlead but once; mistakes are often irreparable, and who am I that I\nshould tell this one and that how he should lead it? Life is a difficult\nbusiness and I have found it hard enough to make my own a complete and\nrounded thing; I have not been tempted to teach my neighbour what he\nshould do with his. But there are men who flounder at the journey's\nstart, the way before them is confused and hazardous, and on occasion,\nhowever unwillingly, I have been forced to point the finger of fate.\nSometimes men have said to me, what shall I do with my life? and I have\nseen myself for a moment wrapped in the dark cloak of Destiny.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOnce I know that I advised well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was a young man and I lived in a modest apartment in London near\nVictoria Station. Late one afternoon, when I was beginning to think that\nI had worked enough for that day, I heard a ring at the bell. I opened\nthe door to a total stranger. He asked me my name; I told him. He asked\nif he might come in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Certainly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI led him into my sitting-room and begged him to sit down. He seemed a\ntrifle embarrassed. I offered him a cigarette and he had some difficulty\nin lighting it without letting go of his hat. When he had satisfactorily\nachieved this feat I asked him if I should not put it on a chair for\nhim. He quickly did this and while doing it dropped his umbrella.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope you don't mind my coming to see you like this,\" he said. \"My\nname is Stephens and I am a doctor. You're in the medical, I believe?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, but I don't practise.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I know. I've just read a book of yours about Spain and I wanted to\nask you about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not a very good book, I'm afraid.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The fact remains that you know something about Spain and there's no one\nelse I know who does. And I thought perhaps you wouldn't mind giving me\nsome information.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall be very glad.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was silent for a moment. He reached out for his hat and holding it in\none hand absent-mindedly stroked it with the other. I surmised that it\ngave him confidence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope you won't think it very odd for a perfect stranger to talk to\nyou like this.\" He gave an apologetic laugh. \"I'm not going to tell you\nthe story of my life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen people say this to me I always know that it is precisely what they\nare going to do. I do not mind. In fact I rather like it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was brought up by two old aunts. I've never been anywhere. I've never\ndone anything. I've been married for six years. I have no children. I'm\na medical officer at the Camberwell Infirmary. I can't stick it any\nmore.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was something very striking in the short, sharp sentences he used.\nThey had a forcible ring. I had not given him more than a cursory\nglance, but now I looked at him with curiosity. He was a little man,\nthick-set and stout, of thirty perhaps, with a round red face from which\nshone small, dark and very bright eyes. His black hair was cropped close\nto a bullet-shaped head. He was dressed in a blue suit a good deal the\nworse for wear. It was baggy at the knees and the pockets bulged\nuntidily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know what the duties are of a medical officer in an infirmary. One\nday is pretty much like another. And that's all I've got to look forward\nto for the rest of my life. Do you think it's worth it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a means of livelihood,\" I answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I know. The money's pretty good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't exactly know why you've come to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I wanted to know whether you thought there would be any chance\nfor an English doctor in Spain?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why Spain?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know, I just have a fancy for it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not like <i>Carmen</i>, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But there's sunshine there, and there's good wine, and there's colour,\nand there's air you can breathe. Let me say what I have to say straight\nout. I heard by accident that there was no English doctor in Seville. Do\nyou think I could earn a living there? Is it madness to give up a good\nsafe job for an uncertainty?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does your wife think about it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's willing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a great risk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know. But if you say take it, I will: if you say stay where you are,\nI'll stay.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was looking at me intently with those bright dark eyes of his and I\nknew that he meant what he said. I reflected for a moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your whole future is concerned: you must decide for yourself. But this\nI can tell you: if you don't want money but are content to earn just\nenough to keep body and soul together, then go. For you will lead a\nwonderful life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe left me, I thought about him for a day or two, and then forgot. The\nepisode passed completely from my memory.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMany years later, fifteen at least, I happened to be in Seville and\nhaving some trifling indisposition asked the hotel porter whether there\nwas an English doctor in the town. He said there was and gave me the\naddress. I took a cab and as I drove up to the house a little fat man\ncame out of it. He hesitated when he caught sight of me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you come to see me?\" he said. \"I'm the English doctor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI explained my errand and he asked me to come in. He lived in an\nordinary Spanish house, with a patio, and his consulting room which led\nout of it was littered with papers, books, medical appliances, and\nlumber. The sight of it would have startled a squeamish patient. We did\nour business and then I asked the doctor what his fee was. He shook his\nhead and smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no fee.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why on earth not?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you remember me? Why, I'm here because of something you said to\nme. You changed my whole life for me. I'm Stephens.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had not the least notion what he was talking about. He reminded me of\nour interview, he repeated to me what we had said, and gradually, out of\nthe night, a dim recollection of the incident came back to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was wondering if I'd ever see you again,\" he said, \"I was wondering\nif ever I'd have a chance of thanking you for all you've done for me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's been a success then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI looked at him. He was very fat now and bald, but his eyes twinkled\ngaily and his fleshy, red face bore an expression of perfect\ngood-humour. The clothes he wore, terribly shabby they were, had been\nmade obviously by a Spanish tailor and his hat was the wide-brimmed\nsombrero of the Spaniard. He looked to me as though he knew a good\nbottle of wine when he saw it. He had a dissipated, though entirely\nsympathetic, appearance. You might have hesitated to let him remove your\nappendix, but you could not have imagined a more delightful creature to\ndrink a glass of wine with.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Surely you were married?\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. My wife didn't like Spain, she went back to Camberwell, she was\nmore at home there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I'm sorry for that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis black eyes flashed a bacchanalian smile. He really had somewhat the\nlook of a young Silenus.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Life is full of compensations,\" he murmured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when a Spanish woman, no longer\nin her first youth, but still boldly and voluptuously beautiful,\nappeared at the door. She spoke to him in Spanish, and I could not fail\nto perceive that she was the mistress of the house.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs he stood at the door to let me out he said to me:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You told me when last I saw you that if I came here I should earn just\nenough money to keep body and soul together, but that I should lead a\nwonderful life. Well, I want to tell you that you were right. Poor I\nhave been and poor I shall always be, but by heaven I've enjoyed myself.\nI wouldn't exchange the life I've had with that of any king in the\nworld.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nOne of the many inconveniences of real life is that it seldom gives you\na complete story. Some incident has excited your interest, the people\nwho are concerned in it are in the devil's own muddle, and you wonder\nwhat on earth will happen next. Well, generally nothing happens. The\ninevitable catastrophe you foresaw wasn't inevitable after all, and high\ntragedy, without any regard to artistic decency, dwindles into\ndrawing-room comedy. Now, growing old has many disadvantages, but it has\nthis compensation (among, let us admit, not a few others), that\nsometimes it gives you the opportunity of seeing what was the outcome of\ncertain events you had witnessed long ago. You had given up the hope of\never knowing what was the end of the story, and then, when you least\nexpected it, it is handed to you on a platter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThese reflections occurred to me when, having escorted the Marquesa de\nSan Esteban to her car, I went back into the hotel and sat down again in\nthe lounge. I ordered a cocktail, lit a cigarette and composed myself to\norder my recollections. The hotel was new and splendid, it was like\nevery other first-class hotel in Europe, and I had been regretting that\nfor the sake of its modern plumbing I had deserted the old-fashioned,\npicturesque Hotel de Madrid to which I generally went when I stayed in\nSeville. It was true that from my hotel I had a view of the noble river,\nthe Guadalquivir, but that did not make up for the <i>thés dansants</i> that\nfilled the bar-lounge two or three days a week with a fashionable crowd\nwhose exuberant conversation almost drowned the strident din of a jazz\norchestra.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had been out all the afternoon, and coming in found myself in the\nmidst of a seething mob. I went to the desk and asked for my key so that\nI might go straight up to my room. But the porter, handing it to me,\nsaid that a lady had been asking for me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She wants to see you very much. It's the Marquesa de San Esteban.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI knew no one of that name.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must be some mistake.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs I said the words, looking rather vaguely around, a lady came up to me\nwith outstretched hands and a bright smile on her lips. To the best of\nmy knowledge I had never seen her before in my life. She seized my\nhands, both of them, and shook them warmly. She spoke in fluent French.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How very nice to see you again after all these years. I saw by the\npaper that you were staying here and I said to myself: I must look him\nup. How many years is it since we danced together? I daren't think. Do\nyou still dance? I do. And I'm a grandmother. I'm fat of course, I don't\ncare, and it keeps me from getting fatter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe talked with such a rush that it took my breath away to listen to\nher. She was a stout, more than middle-aged woman, very much made up,\nwith dark red hair, obviously dyed, cut short; and she was dressed in\nthe height of Parisian fashion, which never suits Spanish women very\nwell. But she had a gay, fruity laugh that made you feel you wanted to\nlaugh too. It was quite obvious that she thoroughly enjoyed life. She\nwas a fine figure of a woman and I could well believe that in youth she\nhad been beautiful. But I could not place her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come and drink a glass of champagne with me and we will talk of old\ntimes. Or will you have a cocktail? Our dear old Seville has changed,\nyou see. <i>Thés dansants</i> and cocktails. It's just like Paris and London\nnow. We've caught up. We're a civilised people.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe led me to a table near the space where they were dancing and we sat\ndown. I could not go on pretending I was at ease; I thought I should\nonly get into a fearful mess.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's terribly stupid of me, I'm afraid,\" I said, \"but I don't seem able\nto remember ever having known anyone of your name in the old days in\nSeville.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"San Esteban?\" she interrupted before I could go on. \"Naturally. My\nhusband came from Salamanca. He was in the diplomatic service. I'm a\nwidow. You knew me as Pilar Carreon. Of course having my hair red\nchanges me a little, but otherwise I don't think I've altered much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not at all,\" I said quickly. \"It was only the name that bothered me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course now I remembered her, but I was concerned at the moment only\nwith the effort to conceal from her the mingled consternation and\namusement that filled me as I realised that the Pilar Carreon I had\ndanced with at the Countess de Marbella's parties and at the Fair had\nturned into this stout, flaunting dowager. I could not get over it. But\nI had to watch my step. I wondered if she knew how well I recollected\nthe story that had shaken Seville to its foundations, and I was glad\nwhen after she had finally bidden me an effusive farewell I was able to\nrecall it at ease.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn those days, forty years ago, Seville had not become a prosperous\ncommercial city. It had quiet, white streets, paved with cobbles, with a\nmultitude of churches on the belfries of which storks built their nests.\nBull-fighters, students and loungers sauntered in the Sierpes all day\nlong. Life was easy. This of course, was before the time of motor-cars,\nand the Sevillan would live in penury, practising every possible\neconomy, in order to have a carriage. For this luxury he was willing to\nsacrifice the necessities of life. Everyone who had any claim to\ngentility drove up and down the Delicias, the park-like gardens by the\nGuadalquivir, every blessed afternoon from five till seven. You saw\ncarriages of all sorts, from fashionable London victorias to old\nbroken-down shays that seemed as though they would fall to pieces,\nmagnificent horses and wretched hacks whose tragic end in the bull-ring\nwas near at hand. But there was one equipage that could not fail to\nattract the stranger's attention. It was a victoria, very smart and new,\ndrawn by two beautiful mules; and the coachman and the footman wore the\nnational costume of Andalusia in pale grey. It was the most splendid\nturn-out Seville had ever known, and it belonged to the Countess de\nMarbella. She was a Frenchwoman married to a Spaniard, who had\nenthusiastically adopted the manners and customs of her husband's\ncountry, but with a Parisian elegance that gave them a peculiar\ndistinction. The rest of the carriages went at a snail's pace so that\ntheir occupants could see and be seen, but the countess, behind her\nmules, dashed up between the two crawling lines at a fast trot, went to\nthe end of the Delicias and back twice and then drove away. The\nproceeding savoured somewhat of royalty. When you looked at her\ngracefully seated in that swift victoria, her head handsomely poised,\nher hair of too brilliant a gold to be natural, you did not wonder that\nher French vivacity and determination had given her the position she\nheld. She made the fashion. Her decrees were law. But the countess had\ntoo many adorers not to have as many enemies, and the most determined of\nthese was the widowed Duchess de Dos Palos, whose birth and social\nconsequence made her claim as a right the first place in Society which\nthe Frenchwoman had won by grace, wit and character.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow the duchess had an only daughter. This was Doña Pilar. She was\ntwenty when I first knew her and she was very beautiful. She had\nmagnificent eyes and a skin that, however hard you tried to find a less\nhackneyed way to describe it, you could only call peach-like. She was\nvery slim, rather tall for a Spanish girl, with a red mouth and\ndazzlingly white teeth. She wore her abundant, shining black hair\ndressed very elaborately in the Spanish style of the period. She was\ninfinitely alluring. The fire in her black eyes, the warmth of her\nsmile, the seductiveness of her movements suggested so much passion that\nit really wasn't quite fair. She belonged to the generation which was\nstraining to break the old conventions that had kept the Spanish girl of\ngood family hidden away till it was time for her to be married. I often\nplayed tennis with her and I used to dance with her at the Countess de\nMarbella's parties. The duchess considered the Frenchwoman's parties,\nwith champagne and a sit-down supper, ostentatious, and when she opened\nher own great house to Society, which was only twice a year, it was to\ngive them lemonade and biscuits. But she bred fighting-bulls, as her\nhusband had done, and on the occasions when the young bulls were tried\nout, she gave picnic luncheons to which her friends were asked, very gay\nand informal, but with a sort of feudal state which fascinated my\nromantic imagination. Once, when the duchess's bulls were to fight at a\n<i>corrida</i> in Seville, I rode in with them at night as one of the men\nescorting Doña Pilar, dressed in a costume that reminded one of a\npicture by Goya, who headed the cavalcade. It was a charming experience\nto ride through the night, on those prancing Andalusian horses, with the\nsix bulls, surrounded by oxen, thundering along behind.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA good many men, rich or noble and sometimes both, had asked Doña\nPilar's hand in marriage, but, notwithstanding her mother's\nremonstrances, she had refused them. The duchess had been married at\nfifteen and it seemed to her really indecent that her daughter at twenty\nshould be still single. The duchess asked her what she was waiting for;\nit was absurd to be too difficult. It was her duty to marry. But Pilar\nwas stubborn. She found reasons to reject every one of her suitors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen the truth came out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDuring the daily drives in the Delicias which the duchess, accompanied\nby her daughter, took in a great old-fashioned landau, they passed the\ncountess as she was twice swiftly driven up and down the promenade. The\nladies were on such bad terms that they pretended not to see one\nanother, but Pilar could not keep her eyes off that smart carriage and\nthe two beautiful grey mules and, not wishing to catch the countess's\nsomewhat ironic glance, her own fell on the coachman who drove her. He\nwas the handsomest man in Seville and in his beautiful uniform he was a\nsight to see. Of course no one knew exactly what happened, but\napparently the more Pilar looked at the coachman the more she liked the\nlook of him, and somehow or other, for all this part of the story\nremained a mystery, the pair met. In Spain the classes are strangely\nmingled and the butler may have in his veins much nobler blood than the\nmaster. Pilar learnt, not I think without satisfaction, that the\ncoachman belonged to the ancient family of Leon, than which there is\nnone in Andalusia more distinguished; and really so far as birth went\nthere was little to choose between them. Only her life had been passed\nin a ducal mansion, while fate had forced him to earn his living on the\nbox of a victoria. Neither could regret this, since only in that exalted\nplace could he have attracted the attention of the most difficult young\nwoman in Seville. They fell madly in love with one another. It so\nhappened that just then a young man called the Marques de San Esteban,\nwhom they had met at San Sebastian the summer before, wrote to the\nduchess and asked for Pilar's hand in marriage. He was extremely\neligible and the two families had formed alliances from time to time\never since the reign of Philip II. The duchess was determined not to\nstand any more nonsense, and when she told Pilar of the proposal added\nthat she had shilly-shallied long enough. She must either marry him or\nshe should go into a convent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not going to do either the one or the other,\" said Pilar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do then? I have given you a home long enough.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going to marry José Leon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPilar hesitated for a moment and it may be, it is indeed to be hoped,\nthat she blushed a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's the countess's coachman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What countess?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Countess de Marbella.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI remembered the duchess well and I am sure that when roused she stuck\nat little. She raged, she implored, she cried, she argued There was a\nterrific scene. People said that she slapped her daughter and pulled her\nhair, but I have an impression that Pilar in such a pass was capable of\nhitting back. She repeated that she loved José Leon and he loved her.\nShe was determined to marry him. The duchess called a family council.\nThe matter was put before them and it was decided that to save them all\nfrom disgrace Pilar should be taken away to the country and kept there\ntill she had recovered from her infatuation. Pilar got wind of the\nscheme and put a stop to it by slipping out of the window of her room\none night when everyone was asleep and going to live with her lover's\nparents. They were respectable persons who inhabited a small apartment\non the unfashionable side of the Guadalquivir, in the quarter called\nTriana.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter that no concealment was possible. The fat was in the fire and the\nclubs along the Sierpes buzzed with the scandal. Waiters were kept busy\nbringing trays of little glasses of Manzanilla to the members from the\nneighbouring wine-shops. They gossiped and laughed over the scandal and\nPilar's rejected suitors were the recipients of many congratulations.\nWhat an escape! The duchess was in despair. She could think of nothing\nbetter to do than go to the Archbishop, her trusted friend and former\nconfessor, and beg him himself to reason with the infatuated girl. Pilar\nwas summoned to the episcopal palace, and the good old man, used to\nintervening in family quarrels, did his utmost to show her the folly of\nher course. But she would not be persuaded. Nothing that anyone could\nsay would induce her to forsake the man she loved. The duchess, waiting\nin an adjoining room, was sent for and made a final appeal to her\ndaughter. In vain. Pilar returned to her humble lodging and the duchess\nin tears was left alone with the Archbishop. The Archbishop was no less\nastute than he was pious, and when he saw that the distracted woman was\nin a fit state to listen to him, advised her as a last resource to go to\nthe Countess de Marbella. She was the cleverest woman in Seville and it\nmight be that she could do something.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt first the duchess indignantly refused. She would never suffer the\nhumiliation of appealing to her greatest enemy. Sooner might the ancient\nhouse of Dos Palos fall in ruin. The Archbishop was accustomed to\ndealing with tiresome women. He set himself with gentle cunning to\ninduce her to change her mind and presently she consented to throw\nherself on the Frenchwoman's mercy. With rage in her heart she sent a\nmessage asking if she might see her, and that afternoon was ushered into\nher drawing-room. The countess of course had been one of the first to\nhear the story, but she listened to the unhappy mother as though she had\nnot known a thing about it. She relished the situation enormously. It\nwas the crowning triumph to have the vindictive duchess on her knees\nbefore her. But she was at heart a good-natured woman and she had a\nsense of humour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a most unfortunate situation,\" she said. \"And I'm sorry that one\nof my servants should be the occasion of it. But I don't exactly see\nwhat I can do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe duchess would have liked to slap her painted face and her voice\ntrembled a little with the effort she made to control her anger.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is not for my own sake I'm asking you to help. It's for Pilar's. I\nknow, we all know, that you are the cleverest woman in the city. It\nseemed to me, it seemed to the Archbishop, that if there was a way out,\nyour quick wit would find it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe countess knew she was being grossly flattered. She did not mind. She\nliked it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must let me think.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course, if he'd been a gentleman I could have sent for my son and he\nwould have killed him, but the Duke of Dos Palos cannot fight a duel\nwith the Countess de Marbella's coachman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In the old days it would have been so simple. I should merely have\nhired a couple of ruffians and had the brute's throat cut one night in\nthe street. But with all these laws they have nowadays decent people\nhave no way of protecting themselves from insult.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should deplore any method of settling the difficulty that deprived me\nof the services of an excellent coachman,\" murmured the countess.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But if he marries my daughter he cannot continue to be your coachman,\"\ncried the duchess indignantly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you going to give Pilar an income for them to live on?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Me? Not a peseta. I told Pilar at once that she should get nothing from\nme. They can starve for all I care.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I should think rather than do that he will prefer to stay on as\nmy coachman. There are very nice rooms over my stables.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe duchess went pale. The duchess went red.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Forget all that has passed between us. Let us be friends. You can't\nexpose me to such a humiliation. If I've ever done things to affront you\nI ask you on my knees to forgive me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe duchess cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dry your eyes, Duchess,\" the Frenchwoman said at last. \"I will do what\nI can.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is there anything you can do?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps. Is it true that Pilar has and will have no money of her own?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not a penny if she marries without my consent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe countess gave one of her brightest smiles.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is a common impression that southern people are romantic and\nnorthern people matter-of-fact. The reverse is true. It is the\nnortherners who are incurably romantic. I have lived long enough among\nyou Spaniards to know that you are nothing if not practical.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe duchess was too broken to resent openly these unpleasant remarks,\nbut, oh, how she hated the woman! The Countess de Marbella rose to her\nfeet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You shall hear from me in the course of the day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe firmly dismissed her visitor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe carriage was ordered for five o'clock and at ten minutes to, the\ncountess, dressed for her drive, sent for José. When he came into the\ndrawing-room, wearing his pale grey livery with such an air, she could\nnot deny that he was very good to look upon. If he had not been her own\ncoachman--well, it was not the moment for ideas of that sort. He stood\nbefore her, holding himself easily, but with a gallant swagger. There\nwas nothing servile in his bearing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A Greek god,\" the countess murmured to herself. \"It is only Andalusia\nthat can produce such types.\" And then aloud: \"I hear that you are going\nto marry the daughter of the Duchess of Dos Palos.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If the countess does not object.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Whoever you marry is a matter of complete indifference to me. You know\nof course that Doña Pilar will have no fortune.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, madam. I have a good place and I can keep my wife. I love her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't blame you for that. She is a beautiful girl. But I think it\nonly right to tell you that I have a rooted objection to married\ncoachmen. On your wedding-day you leave my service. That is all I had to\nsay to you. You can go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe began to look at the daily paper that had just arrived from Paris,\nbut José, as she expected, did not stir. He stared down at the floor.\nPresently the countess looked up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you waiting for?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never knew madam would send me away,\" he answered in a troubled tone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have no doubt you'll find another place.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, but...\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what is it?\" she asked sharply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sighed miserably.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's not a pair of mules in the whole of Spain to come up to ours.\nThey're almost human beings. They understand every word I say to them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe countess gave him a smile that would have turned the head of anyone\nwho was not madly in love already.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid you must choose between me and your betrothed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe shifted from one foot to the other. He put his hand to his pocket to\nget himself a cigarette, but then, remembering where he was, restrained\nthe gesture. He glanced at the countess and that peculiar shrewd smile\ncame over his face which those who have lived in Andalusia know so well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In that case, I can't hesitate. Pilar must see that this alters my\nposition entirely. One can get a wife any day of the week, but a place\nlike this is found only once in a lifetime. I should be a fool to throw\nit up for a woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat was the end of the adventure. José Leon continued to drive the\nCountess de Marbella, but she noticed when they sped up and down the\nDelicias that thenceforward as many eyes were turned on her handsome\ncoachman as on her latest hat; and a year later Pilar married the\nMarques de San Esteban.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nSome years ago, being engaged on writing a book about Spain in the\nGolden Age, I had occasion to read again the plays of Calderon. Among\nothers I read one called <i>El Medico de su Honra</i>, which means the\nPhysician of his Honour. It is a cruel play and you can hardly read it\nwithout a shudder. But re-reading it, I was reminded of an encounter I\nhad had many years before which has always remained in my memory as one\nof the strangest I have ever known. I was quite young then and I had\ngone to Seville on a short visit to see the celebration of the Feast of\nCorpus Christi. It was the height of summer and the heat was terrific.\nGreat sail-cloths were drawn across the narrow streets, giving a\ngrateful shade, but in the squares the sun beat down mercilessly. In the\nmorning I watched the procession. It was splendid and impressive. The\ncrowd knelt down as the Host was solemnly carried past, and the Civil\nGuards in full uniform stood at salute to do homage to the heavenly\nKing. And in the afternoon I joined the dense throng which was making\nits way to the bull-ring. The cigarette girls and the sewing girls wore\ncarnations in their dark hair and their young men were dressed in all\ntheir best. It was just after the Spanish-American war, and the short,\nembroidered jacket, the skin-tight trousers and the broad-brimmed,\nlow-crowned hat were still worn. Sometimes the crowd was scattered by a\npicador on the wretched hack that would never survive the afternoon, and\nthe rider, with conscious pride in his picturesque costume, exchanged\npleasantries with the facetious. A long line of carriages, dilapidated\nand shabby, overfilled with <i>aficionados</i>, drove noisily along.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI went early, for it amused me to see the people gradually filling the\nvast arena. The cheaper seats in the sun were already packed, and it was\na curious effect that the countless fans made, like the fluttering of a\nhost of butterflies, as men and women restlessly fanned themselves. In\nthe shade, where I was sitting, the places were taken more slowly, but\neven there, an hour before the fight began, one had to look rather\ncarefully for a seat. Presently a man stopped in front of me and with a\npleasant smile asked if I could make room for him. When he had settled\ndown, I took a sidelong glance at him and noticed that he was\nwell-dressed, in English clothes, and looked like a gentleman. He had\nbeautiful hands, small but resolute, with thin, long fingers. Wanting a\ncigarette, I took out my case and thought it would be polite to offer\nhim one. He accepted. He had evidently seen that I was a foreigner, for\nhe thanked me in French.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are English?\" he went on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How is it you haven't run away from the heat?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI explained that I had come on purpose to see the Feast of Corpus\nChristi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After all, it's something you must come to Seville for.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen I made some casual remark about the vast concourse of people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No one would imagine that Spain was bleeding from the loss of all that\nremained of her Empire and that her ancient glory is now nothing but a\nname.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's a great deal left.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The sunshine, the blue sky, and the future.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe spoke dispassionately, as though the misfortunes of his fallen\ncountry were no concern of his. Not knowing what to reply, I remained\nsilent. We waited. The boxes began to fill up. Ladies in their mantillas\nof black or white lace entered them and spread their Manila shawls over\nthe balustrade so as to form a gay and many-coloured drapery. Now and\nthen, when one of them was of particular beauty, a round of applause\nwould greet her appearance and she would smile and bow without\nembarrassment. At last the president of the bull-fight made his entry,\nthe band struck up, and the fighters, all glittering in their satin and\ngold and silver, marched swaggering across the ring. A minute later a\ngreat black bull charged in. Carried away by the horrible excitement of\nthe contest, I noticed, notwithstanding, that my neighbour remained\ncool. When a man fell and only escaped by a miracle the horns of the\nfurious beast, and with a gasp thousands sprang to their feet, he\nremained motionless. The bull was killed and the mules dragged out the\nhuge carcass. I sank back exhausted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you like bull-fighting?\" he asked me. \"Most English do, though I\nhave noticed that in their own country they say hard enough things about\nit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can one like something that fills one with horror and loathing? Each\ntime I come to a fight I swear I will never go to another. And yet I\ndo.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a curious passion that leads us to delight in the peril of others.\nPerhaps it's natural to the human race. The Romans had their gladiators\nand the moderns have their melodramas. It may be that it is an instinct\nin man to find pleasure in bloodshed and torture.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not answer directly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you think that the bull-fight is the reason why human life is of\nso little account in Spain?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And do you think human life is of any great account?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI gave him a quick look, for there was an ironical tone in his voice\nthat no one could have missed, and I saw that his eyes were full of\nmockery. I flushed a little, for he made me on a sudden feel very young.\nI was surprised at the change of his expression. He had seemed rather an\namiable man, with his large soft friendly eyes, but now his face bore a\nlook of sardonic hauteur which was a trifle disquieting. I shrank back\ninto my shell. We said little to one another during the rest of the\nafternoon, but when the last bull was killed and we all rose to our feet\nhe shook hands with me and expressed the hope that we might meet again.\nIt was a mere politeness and neither of us, I imagine, thought that\nthere was even a remote possibility of it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut quite by chance, two or three days later, we did. I was in a quarter\nof Seville that I did not know very well. I had been that afternoon to\nthe palace of the Duke of Alba, which I knew had a fine garden and in\none of the rooms a magnificent ceiling reputed to have been made by\nMoorish captives before the fall of Granada. It was not easy to gain\nadmittance, but I wanted very much to see it and thought that now, in\nthe height of summer when there were no tourists, with two or three\npesetas I might be allowed in. I was disappointed. The man in charge\ntold me that the house was under repair and no stranger could visit it\nwithout a written permission from the Duke's agent. So, having nothing\nelse to do, I went to the royal garden of the Alcazar, the old palace of\nDon Pedro the Cruel, whose memory lives still among the people of\nSeville. It was very pleasant among the orange trees and cypresses. I\nhad a book with me, a volume of Calderon, and I sat there for a while\nand read. Then I went for a stroll. In the older parts of Seville the\nstreets are narrow and tortuous. It is delicious to wander along them\nunder the awnings that stretch above, but not easy to find one's way. I\nlost mine. When I had just made up my mind that I had no notion in which\ndirection to turn I saw a man walking towards me and recognised my\nacquaintance of the bull-ring. I stopped him and asked whether he could\ndirect me. He remembered me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll never find your way,\" he smiled, turning round. \"I'll walk a\nlittle with you until you can't mistake it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI protested, but he would not listen. He assured me it was no trouble.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You haven't gone away then?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm leaving to-morrow. I've just been to the Duke of Alba's house. I\nwanted to see that Moorish ceiling of his, but they wouldn't let me in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you interested in Arabic art?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, yes. I've heard that that ceiling is one of the finest things in\nSeville.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I could show you one as good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at me for a moment reflectively as though wondering what sort\nof a person I was. If he was, he evidently came to a satisfactory\ndecision.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you have ten minutes to spare I will take you to it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI thanked him warmly and we turned back and retraced our steps. We\nchatted of indifferent things till we came to a large house, washed in\npale green, with the Arabic look of a prison, the windows on the street\nheavily barred, which so many houses in Seville have. My guide clapped\nhis hands at the gateway and a servant looked out from a window into the\npatio, and pulled a cord.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Whose house is this?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was surprised, for I knew how jealously Spaniards guarded their\nprivacy and how little inclined they were to admit strangers into their\nhouses. The heavy iron gate swung open and we walked into the courtyard;\nwe crossed it and went through a narrow passage. Then I found myself\nsuddenly in an enchanted garden. It was walled on three sides, with\nwalls as high as houses; and their old red brick, softened by time, was\ncovered with roses. They clad every inch in wanton, scented luxuriance.\nIn the garden, growing wildly, as if the gardeners had striven in vain\nto curb the exuberance of nature, were palm-trees rising high into the\nair in their passionate desire for the sun, dark orange-trees and trees\nin flower whose names I did not know, and among them roses and more\nroses. The fourth wall was a Moorish loggia, with horseshoe arches\nheavily decorated with tracery, and when we entered this I saw the\nmagnificent ceiling. It was like a little bit of the Alcazar, but it had\nnot suffered the restorations that have taken all the charm from that\npalace, and the colours were exquisitely tender. It was a gem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Believe me, you need not regret that you have not been able to see the\nduke's house. Further, you can say that you have seen something that no\nother foreigner has seen within living memory.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's very kind of you to have shown it to me. I'm infinitely grateful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked about him with a pride with which I could sympathise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was built by one of my own ancestors in the time of Don Pedro the\nCruel. It is very likely that the King himself more than once caroused\nunder this ceiling with my ancestor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI held out the book I was carrying.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've just been reading a play in which Don Pedro is one of the\nimportant characters.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is the book?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI handed it to him and he glanced at the title. I looked about me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course, what adds to the beauty is that wonderful garden,\" I said.\n\"The whole impression is awfully romantic.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Spaniard was evidently pleased with my enthusiasm. He smiled. I had\nalready noticed how grave his smile was. It hardly dispelled the\nhabitual melancholy of his expression.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would you like to sit down for a few minutes and smoke a cigarette?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should love to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe walked out into the garden and came upon a lady sitting on a bench of\nMoorish tiles like those in the gardens of the Alcazar. She was working\nat some embroidery. She looked up quickly, evidently taken aback to see\na stranger, and gave my companion an enquiring stare.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Allow me to present you to my wife,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe lady gravely bowed. She was very beautiful, with magnificent eyes, a\nstraight nose with delicate nostrils, and a pale smooth skin. In her\nblack hair, abundant as with most Spanish women, there was a broad white\nstreak. Her face was quite unlined and she could not have been more than\nthirty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You have a very lovely garden, Señora,\" I said because I had to say\nsomething.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave it an indifferent glance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, it is pretty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI felt suddenly embarrassed. I did not expect her to show me any\ncordiality, and I could not blame her if she thought my intrusion merely\na nuisance. There was something about her that I could not quite make\nout. It was not an active hostility. Absurd, as it seemed, since she was\na young woman and beautiful, I felt that there was something dead in\nher.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you going to sit here?\" she asked her husband.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"With your permission. Only for a few minutes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I won't disturb you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gathered her silks and the canvas on which she had been working and\nrose to her feet. When she stood up I saw that she was taller than\nSpanish women generally are. She gave me an unsmiling bow. She carried\nherself with a sort of royal composure and her gait was stately. I was\nflippant in those days, and I remember saying to myself that she was not\nthe sort of girl you could very well think of being silly with. We sat\ndown on the multi-coloured bench and I gave my host a cigarette. I held\na match to it. He still had my volume of Calderon in his hands, and now\nhe idly turned the pages.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Which of the plays have you been reading?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>El Medico de su Honra.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave me a look, and I thought I discerned in his large eyes a\nsardonic glint.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what do you think of it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think it's revolting. The fact is, of course, that the idea is so\nforeign to our modern notions.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What idea?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The point of honour and all that sort of thing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI should explain that the point of honour is the mainspring of much of\nthe Spanish drama. It is the nobleman's code that impels a man to kill\nhis wife, in cold blood, not only if she has been unfaithful to him, but\neven if, however little she was to blame, her conduct has given rise to\nscandal. In this particular play there is an example of this more\ndeliberate than any I have ever read: the physician of his honour takes\nvengeance on his wife, though aware that she is innocent, simply as a\nmatter of decorum.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's in the Spanish blood,\" said my friend. \"The foreigner must just\ntake it or leave it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, come, a lot of water has flowed down the Guadalquivir since\nCalderon's day. You're not going to pretend that any man would behave\nlike that now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"On the contrary I pretend that even now a husband who finds himself in\nsuch a humiliating and ridiculous position can only regain his\nself-respect by the offender's death.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not answer. It seemed to me that he was pulling a romantic\ngesture, and within me I murmured, Bosh. He gave me an ironic smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you ever heard of Don Pedro Aguria?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The name is not unknown in Spanish history. An ancestor was Admiral of\nSpain under Philip II and another was bosom friend to Philip IV. By\nroyal command he sat for his portrait to Velasquez.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy host hesitated a moment. He gave me a long, reflective stare before\nhe went on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Under the Philips the Agurias were rich, but by the time my friend Don\nPedro succeeded his father their circumstances were much reduced. But\nstill he was not poor, he had estates between Cordova and Aguilar, and\nin Seville his house retained at least traces of its ancient splendour.\nThe little world of Seville was astonished when he announced his\nengagement to Soledad, the daughter of the ruined Count of Acaba, for\nthough her family was distinguished her father was an old scamp. He was\ncrippled with debts, and the shifts he resorted to in order to keep his\nhead above water were none too nice. But Soledad was beautiful and Don\nPedro in love with her. They were married. He adored her with the\nvehement passion of which perhaps only a Spaniard is capable. But he\ndiscovered to his dismay that she did not love him. She was kind and\ngentle. She was a good wife and a good housekeeper. She was grateful to\nhim. But that was all. He thought that when she had a child she would\nchange, but the child came, and it made no difference. The barrier\nbetween them that he had felt from the beginning was still there. He\nsuffered. At last he told himself that she had a character too noble, a\nspirit too delicate, to descend to earthly passion, and he resigned\nhimself. She was too high above him for mortal love.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI moved a little uneasily in my seat. I thought the Spaniard was unduly\nrhetorical. He went on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know that here in Seville the Opera House is open only for the six\nweeks after Easter, and since the Sevillans don't care very much for\nEuropean music we go more to meet our friends than to listen to the\nsingers. The Agurias had a box, like everybody else, and they went on\nthe opening night of the season. <i>Tannhaüser</i> was being given. Don Pedro\nand his wife, like typical Spaniards, with nothing to do all day but\nalways late, did not arrive till nearly the end of the first act. In the\ninterval the Count of Acaba, Soledad's father, came into the box\naccompanied by a young officer of artillery whom Don Pedro had never\nseen before. But Soledad seemed to know him well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Here is Pepe Alvarez,' said the Count. 'He's just come back from Cuba\nand I insisted on bringing him to see you.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Soledad smiled and held out her hand, then introduced the newcomer to\nher husband.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Pepe is the son of the attorney at Carmona. We used to play together\nwhen we were children.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Carmona is a small town near Seville, and it was here that the Count\nhad retired when his creditors in the city grew too troublesome. The\nhouse he owned there was almost all that was left him of the fortune he\nhad squandered. He lived in Seville now through Don Pedro's generosity.\nBut Don Pedro did not like him and he bowed stiffly to the young\nofficer. He guessed that his father the attorney and the count had been\nconcerned together in transactions that were none too reputable. In a\nminute he left the box to talk with his cousin, the Duchess of\nSantaguador, whose box was opposite his own. A few days later he met\nPepe Alvarez at his club in the Sierpes and had a chat with him. To his\nsurprise he found him a very pleasant young fellow. He was full of his\nexploits in Cuba and he related them with humour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The six weeks about Easter and the great Fair are the gayest in\nSeville, and the world meets to exchange gossip and laughter, at one\nfestivity after another. Pepe Alvarez with his good nature and high\nspirits was in great request and the Agurias met him constantly. Don\nPedro saw that he amused Soledad. She was more vivacious when he was\nthere, and her laughter, which he had so seldom heard, was a delight to\nhim. Like other members of the aristocracy he took a booth for the Fair,\nwhere they danced, supped and drank champagne till dawn. Pepe Alvarez\nwas always the life and soul of the parties.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One night Don Pedro was dancing with the Duchess of Santaguador and\nthey passed Soledad with Pepe Alvarez.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Soledad is looking very beautiful this evening,' she remarked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'And happy,' he replied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Is it true that once she was engaged to be married to Pepe Alvarez?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Of course not.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But the question startled him. He had known that Soledad and Pepe had\nknown one another when they were children, but it had never crossed his\nmind that there could have been anything between them. The Count of\nAcaba, though a rogue, was a gentleman by birth, and it was\ninconceivable that he could have thought of marrying his daughter to the\nson of a provincial attorney. When they got home Don Pedro told his wife\nwhat the duchess had said and what he had replied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'But I was engaged to Pepe,' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Why did you never tell me?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It was finished and done with. He was in Cuba. I never expected to see\nhim again.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'There must be people who know you were engaged to him.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I daresay. Does it matter?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Very much. You shouldn't have renewed your acquaintance with him when\nhe returned.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Does that mean that you have no confidence in me?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Of course not. I have every confidence in you. All the same I wish you\nto discontinue it now.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'And if I refuse?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I shall kill him.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They looked long into one another's eyes. Then she gave him a little\nbow and went to her room. Don Pedro sighed. He wondered whether she\nstill loved Pepe Alvarez and whether it was on account of this that she\nhad never loved him. But he would not allow himself to give way to the\nunworthy emotion of jealousy. He looked into his heart and was sure that\nit harboured no feeling of hatred for the young artilleryman. On the\ncontrary, he liked him. This was not an affair of love or hate, but of\nhonour. On a sudden he remembered that a few days before when he went to\nhis club he noticed that the conversation suddenly failed, and, looking\nback, he seemed to remember that several of the group who were sitting\nthere and chatting eyed him curiously. Was it possible that he had been\nthe subject of their conversation? He shivered a little at the thought.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Fair was drawing to its end, and when it was over the Agurias had\narranged to go to Cordova, where Don Pedro had an estate which it was\nnecessary for him to visit from time to time. He looked forward to the\npeace of a country life after the turmoil of Seville. The day after this\nconversation Soledad, saying she was not well, stayed in the house, and\nshe did the same the day following. Don Pedro visited her in her room\nmorning and evening and they talked of indifferent things. But on the\nthird day his cousin Conchita de Santaguador was giving a ball. It was\nthe last of the season and everyone in her exclusive set would be there.\nSoledad, saying she was still indisposed, announced that she would stay\nat home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Are you refusing to go because of our conversation of the other\nnight?' Don Pedro asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I have been thinking over what you said. I think your demand\nunreasonable, but I shall accede to it. The only way I can cease my\nfriendship with Pepe is by not going to places where I am likely to meet\nhim.' A tremor of pain passed over her lovely face. 'Perhaps it is\nbest.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Do you love him still?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Yes.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don Pedro felt himself go cold with anguish.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Then why did you marry me?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Pepe was away, in Cuba, no one knew when he would come back. Perhaps\nnever. My father said that I must marry you.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'To save him from ruin?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'From worse than ruin.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I am very sorry for you.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You have been kind to me. I have done everything in my power to prove\nto you that I am grateful.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'And does Pepe love you?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She shook her head and smiled sadly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Men are different. He's young. He's too gay to love anyone very long.\nNo, to him I'm just the friend whom he used to play with when he was a\nchild and flirt with when he was a boy. He can make jokes about the love\nhe once had for me.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He took her hand and pressed it, then kissed it and left her. He went\nto the ball by himself. His friends were sorry to hear of Soledad's\nindisposition, but after expressing a proper sympathy devoted themselves\nto the evening's amusement. Don Pedro drifted into the card-room. There\nwas room at a table, and he sat down to play <i>chemin de fer</i>. He played\nwith extraordinary luck and made a good deal of money. One of the\nplayers laughingly asked where Soledad was that evening. Don Pedro saw\nanother give him a startled glance, but he laughed and answered that she\nwas safely in bed and asleep. Then an unlucky incident occurred. Some\nyoung man came into the room, and addressing an artillery officer who\nwas playing asked where Pepe Alvarez was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Isn't he here?' said the officer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"An odd silence fell upon the party. Don Pedro exercised all his\nself-control to prevent his face from showing what he suddenly felt. The\nthought flashed through his mind that those men at the table suspected\nthat Pepe was with Soledad, his wife. Oh, the shame! The indignity! He\nforced himself to go on playing for another hour and still he won. He\ncould not go wrong. The game broke up and he returned to the ballroom.\nHe went up to his cousin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I've hardly had a word with you,' he said. 'Come into another room and\nlet us sit down for a little.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'If you like.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The room, Conchita's boudoir, was empty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Where is Pepe Alvarez to-night?' he asked casually.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I can't think.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You were expecting him?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Of course.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was smiling as he was, but he noticed that she looked at him\nsharply. He dropped his mask of casualness and, though they were alone,\nlowered his voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Conchita, I beseech you to tell me the truth. Are they saying that he\nis Soledad's lover?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Pedrito, what a monstrous question to put to me!'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But he had seen the terror in her eyes and the sudden instinctive\nmovement of her hand to her face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You've answered it.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He got up and left her. He went home and looking up from the patio saw\na light in his wife's room. He went upstairs and knocked at the door.\nThere was no answer, but he went in. To his surprise, for it was late,\nshe was sitting up working at the embroidery upon which much of her time\nwas spent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Why are you working at this hour?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I couldn't sleep, I couldn't read. I thought it would distract my mind\nif I worked.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He did not sit down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Soledad, I have something to tell you that must cause you pain. I must\nask you to be brave. Pepe Alvarez was not at Conchita's to-night.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What is that to me?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It is unfortunate that you were not there either. Everyone at the ball\nthought that you were together.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'That's preposterous.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I know, but that doesn't help matters. You could have opened the gate\nfor him yourself and let him out, or you could have slipped out yourself\nwithout anyone seeing you go or come.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'But do you believe it?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No. I agreed with you that the thing was preposterous. Where was Pepe\nAlvarez?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'How do I know? How should I know?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It is very strange that he should not have come to the most brilliant\nparty, the last party, of the season.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was silent for a minute.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'The night after you spoke to me about him I wrote and told him that in\nview of the circumstances I thought it would be better if in future we\nsaw no more of one another than could be helped. It may be that he did\nnot go to the ball for the same reason that I did not.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They were silent for a while. He looked down at the ground, but he felt\nthat her eyes were fixed on him. I should have told you before that Don\nPedro possessed one accomplishment which raised him above his fellows,\nbut at the same time was a drawback. He was the best shot in Andalusia.\nEveryone knew this and it would have been a brave man who ventured to\noffend him. A few days earlier there had been pigeon-shooting at\nTablada, the wide common outside Seville along the Guadalquivir, and Don\nPedro had carried all before him. Pepe Alvarez on the other hand had\nshown himself so indifferent a marksman that everyone had laughed at\nhim. The young artilleryman had borne the chaff with good-humour. Cannon\nwere his weapon, he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What are you going to do?' Soledad asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You know that there is only one thing I can do.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She understood. But she tried to treat what he said as a pleasantry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You're childish. We're not living any more in the sixteenth century.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I know. That is why I am talking to you now. If I have to challenge\nPepe I shall kill him. I don't want to do that. If he will resign his\ncommission and leave Spain I will do nothing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'How can he? Where is he to go?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He can go to South America. He may make his fortune.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Do you expect me to tell him that?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'If you love him.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I love him too much to ask him to run away like a coward. How could he\nface life without honour?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don Pedro laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What has Pepe Alvarez, the son of the attorney at Carmona, to do with\nhonour?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She did not answer, but in her eyes he saw the fierce hatred she bore\nhim. That look stabbed his heart, for he loved her, he loved her as\npassionately as ever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Next day he went to his club and joined a group who were sitting at the\nwindow looking out at the crowd passing up and down the Sierpes. Pepe\nAlvarez was in it. They were talking of last night's party.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Where were you, Pepe?' someone asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'My mother was ill. I had to go to Carmona,' he answered. 'I was\ndreadfully disappointed, but perhaps it was all for the best.' He turned\nlaughingly to Don Pedro. 'I hear you were in luck and won everybody's\nmoney.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'When are you going to give us our revenge, Pedrito?' asked another.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I'm afraid you'll have to wait for that,' he answered. 'I have to go\nto Cordova. I find that my attorney has been robbing me. I know that all\nattorneys are thieves, but I stupidly thought this one was honest.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He seemed to speak quite lightly, and it was as lightly that Pepe\nAlvarez put in his word.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I think you exaggerate, Pedrito. Don't forget that my father is an\nattorney and he at least is honest.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I don't believe it for a minute,' laughed Don Pedro. 'I have no doubt\nthat your father is as big a thief as any.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The insult was so unexpected and so unprovoked that for a moment Pepe\nAlvarez was staggered. The others were startled into sudden seriousness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What do you mean, Pedrito?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Exactly what I say.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It's a lie and you know it's a lie. You must withdraw that at once.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don Pedro laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Of course I shall not withdraw. Your father is a thief and a rascal.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pepe did the only thing he could do. He sprang from his chair and with\nhis open hand hit Don Pedro in the face. The outcome was inevitable.\nNext day the two men met on the frontier of Portugal. Pepe Alvarez, the\nattorney's son, died like a gentleman with a bullet in his heart.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Spaniard ended his story on such a casual note that for the first\nmoment I hardly took it in. But when I did I was profoundly shocked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Barbarous,\" I said. \"It was just cold-blooded murder.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy host got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're talking nonsense, my young friend. Don Pedro did the only thing\nhe could do in the circumstances.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI left Seville next day, and from then till now have never been able to\ndiscover the name of the man who told me this strange story. I have\noften wondered whether the lady I saw, the lady with the pale face and\nthe lock of white hair, was the unhappy Soledad.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI am not much interested in the celebrated and I have never had patience\nwith the passion that afflicts so many to shake hands with the great\nones of the earth. When it is proposed to me to meet some person\ndistinguished above his fellows by his rank or his attainments, I seek\nfor a civil excuse that may enable me to avoid the honour; and when my\nfriend Diego Torre suggested giving me an introduction to Santa Aña I\ndeclined. But for once the excuse I made was sincere; Santa Aña was not\nonly a great poet but also a romantic figure and it would have amused me\nto see in his decrepitude a man whose adventures (in Spain at least)\nwere legendary; but I knew that he was old and ill and I could not\nbelieve that it would be anything but a nuisance to him to meet a\nstranger and a foreigner. Calisto de Santa Aña was the last descendant\nof the Grand School; in a world unsympathetic to Byronism he had led a\nByronic existence and he had narrated his hazardous life in a series of\npoems that had brought him a fame unknown to his contemporaries. I am no\njudge of their value, for I read them first when I was three-and-twenty\nand then was enraptured by them; they had a passion, a heroic arrogance\nand a multi-coloured vitality that swept me off my feet, and to this\nday, so intermingled are those ringing lines and haunting cadences with\nthe charming memories of my youth, I cannot read them without a beating\nheart. I am inclined to think that Calisto de Santa Aña deserves the\nreputation he enjoys among the Spanish-speaking peoples. In those days\nhis verses were on the lips of all young men and my friends would talk\nto me endlessly of his wild ways, his vehement speeches (for he was a\npolitician as well as a poet), his incisive wit and his amours. He was a\nrebel and sometimes an outlaw, daring and adventurous; but above all he\nwas a lover. We knew all about his passion for this great actress or\nthat divine singer--had we not read till we knew them by heart the\nburning sonnets in which he described his love, his anguish and his\nwrath?--and we were aware that an infanta of Spain, the proudest\ndescendant of the Bourbons, having yielded to his entreaties, had taken\nthe veil when he ceased to love her. When the Philips, her royal\nancestors, tired of a mistress she entered a convent, for it was\nunfitting that one whom the King had loved should be loved by another,\nand was not Calisto de Santa Aña greater than any earthly king? We\napplauded the lady's romantic gesture; it was creditable to her and\nflattering to our poet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut all this took place many years ago and for a quarter of a century\nDon Calisto, disdainfully withdrawing from a world that had nothing more\nto offer, had lived in seclusion in his native town of Ecija. It was\nwhen I announced my intention of going there (I had been spending a week\nor two in Seville) not because of him, but because it is a charming\nlittle Andalusian town with associations that endear it to me, that\nDiego Torre offered me this introduction. It appeared that Don Calisto\nallowed the younger men of letters occasionally to visit him and now and\nthen would talk to them with the fire that had electrified his hearers\nin the great days of his prime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does he look like now?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Magnificent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you a photograph of him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish I had. He has refused to face the camera since he was\nthirty-five. He says he does not wish posterity to know him other than\nyoung.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI confess that I found this suggestion of vanity not a little touching.\nI knew that in early manhood he was of extraordinary beauty, and that\nmoving sonnet of his written when he grew conscious that youth had for\never left him shows with what a bitter and sardonic pang he must have\nwatched the passing of those looks that had been so fantastically\nadmired.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut I refused my friend's offer; I was quite satisfied to read once more\nthe poems I had known so well and for the rest I preferred to wander\nabout the silent and sunswept streets of Ecija in freedom. It was with\nsome consternation therefore that on the evening of my arrival I\nreceived a note from the great man himself. Diego Torre had written to\nhim of my visit, he said, and it would give him great pleasure if I\nwould call on him at eleven next morning. In the circumstances there was\nnothing for me to do but to present myself at his house at the appointed\nhour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy hotel was in the Plaza and on that spring morning it was animated,\nbut as soon as I left it I might have walked in a deserted city. The\nstreets, the tortuous white streets, were empty but for a woman in black\nnow and then who returned with measured steps from her devotions. Ecija\nis a town of churches and you can seldom go far without seeing a\ncrumbling façade or a tower in which storks have built their nests. Once\nI paused to watch a string of little donkeys pass by. Their red\ncaparisons were faded and they carried I know not what in their\npanniers. But Ecija has been a place of consequence in its day and many\nof these white houses have gateways of stone surmounted by imposing\ncoats of arms, for to this remote spot flowed the riches of the New\nWorld and adventurers who had gathered wealth in the Americas spent here\ntheir declining years. It was in one of these houses that Don Calisto\nlived and as I stood at the <i>reja</i> after pulling the bell, I was pleased\nto think that he lived in such a fitting style. There was a dilapidated\ngrandeur about the massive gateway that suited my impression of the\nflamboyant poet. Though I heard the bell peal through the house no one\nanswered it and I rang a second and then a third time: at last an old\nwoman with a heavy moustache, came to the gate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you want?\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe had fine black eyes, but a sullen look, and I supposed that it was\nshe who took care of the old man. I gave her my card.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have an appointment with your master.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe opened the iron gateway and bade me enter. Asking me to wait she\nleft me and went upstairs. The patio was pleasantly cool after the\nstreet. Its proportions were noble and you surmised that it had been\nbuilt by some follower of the conquistadores; but the paint was\ntarnished, the tiles on the floor broken, and here and there great\nflakes of plaster had fallen away. There was about everything an air of\npoverty but not of squalor. I knew that Don Calisto was poor. Money had\ncome to him easily at times but he had never attached any importance to\nit and had spent it profusely. It was plain that he lived now in a\npenury that he disdained to notice. In the middle of the patio was a\ntable with a rocking-chair on each side of it, and on the table\nnewspapers a fortnight old. I wondered what dreams occupied his fancy as\nhe sat there on the warm summer nights, smoking cigarettes. On the walls\nunder the colonnade were Spanish pictures, dark and bad, and here and\nthere stood an ancient dusty <i>bargueño</i> and on it a mended lustre plate.\nBy the side of a door hung a pair of old pistols, and I had a pleasant\nfancy that they were the weapons he had used when in the most celebrated\nof his many duels, for the sake of Pepa Montañez the dancer (now, I\nsuppose, a toothless and raddled hag), he had killed the Duke of Dos\nHermanos.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe scene, with its associations which i vaguely divined, so aptly\nfitted the romantic poet that I was overcome by the spirit of the place.\nIts noble indigence surrounded him with a glory as great as the\nmagnificence of his youth; in him too there was the spirit of the old\nconquistadores, and it was becoming that he should finish his famous\nlife in that ruined and magnificent house. Thus surely should a poet\nlive and die. I had arrived cool enough and even somewhat bored at the\nprospect of my meeting, but now I began to grow a trifle nervous. I lit\na cigarette. I had come at the time appointed and wondered what detained\nthe old man. The silence was strangely disturbing. Ghosts of the past\nthronged the silent patio and an age dead and gone gained a sort of\nshadowy life for me. The men of that day had a passion and a wildness of\nspirit that are gone out of the world for ever. We are no longer capable\nof their reckless deeds or their theatrical heroics.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI heard a sound and my heart beat quickly. I was excited now and when at\nlast! saw him coming slowly down the stairs I caught my breath. He held\nmy card in his hand. He was a tall old man and exceedingly thin, with a\nskin the colour of old ivory; his hair was abundant and white, but his\nbushy eyebrows were dark still; they made his great eyes flash with a\nmore sombre fire. It was wonderful that at his age those black eyes\nshould still preserve their brilliance. His nose was aquiline, his mouth\nclose-set. His unsmiling eyes rested on me as he approached and there\nwas in them a look of cool appraisal. He was dressed in black and in one\nhand held a broad-brimmed hat. There was in his bearing assurance and\ndignity. He was as I should have wished him to be and as I watched him I\nunderstood how he had swayed men's minds and touched their hearts. He\nwas every inch a poet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had reached the patio and came slowly towards me. He had really the\neyes of an eagle. It seemed to a tremendous moment, for there he stood,\nthe heir of the great old Spanish poets, the magnificent Herrera, the\nnostalgic and moving Fray Luis, Juan de la Cruz, the mystic, and the\ncrabbed and obscure Gongora. He was the last of that long line and he\ntrod in their steps not unworthily. Strangely in my heart sang the\nlovely and tender song which is the most famous of Don Calisto's lyrics.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was abashed. It was fortunate for me that I had prepared beforehand\nthe phrase with which I meant to greet him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is a wonderful honour, Maestro, for a foreigner such as I to make\nthe acquaintance of so great a poet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA flicker of amusement passed through those piercing eyes and a smile\nfor an instant curved the lines of that stern mouth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am not a poet, Señor, but a bristle merchant. You have made a\nmistake, Don Calisto lives next door.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had come to the wrong house.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nTwo or three people, hearing sounds of a quarrel in the patio, came out\nof their rooms and listened.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's the new lodger,\" said a woman. \"She's having a row with the porter\nwho brought her things.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a tenement house of two storeys, built round a patio, in a back\nstreet of La Macarena, which is the roughest quarter in Seville. The\nrooms were let to working men and the small functionaries with whom\nSpain is overrun, postmen, policemen, or tram-conductors, and the place\nswarmed with children. There were twenty families there. They squabbled\nand made it up; they chattered their heads off; they helped one another\nwhen help was needed; for the Andalusians are good-natured people, and\non the whole they got on well enough together. One room had been for\nsome time unlet. A woman had taken it that morning, and an hour later\nhad brought her bits and pieces, carrying as much as she could herself,\na <i>gallego</i>--the Galicians are the general porters of Spain--laden with\nthe rest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the quarrel was growing more violent, and the two women above, on\nthe first floor, anxious not to miss a word, leant over the balcony.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey heard the newcomer's shrill voice raised in a torrent of abuse and\nthe man's sullen interjections. The two women nudged one another.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shan't go till you pay me,\" he kept on saying.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I've paid you already. You said you'd do it for three reales.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never! You promised me four.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were haggling over rather less than twopence halfpenny.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Four reales for moving those few things? You're crazy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe tried to push him away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shan't go till you pay me,\" he repeated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll give you a penny more.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I won't take it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe dispute grew more and more noisy. The woman screamed at the porter\nand cursed him. She shook her fist in his face. At last he lost\npatience.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, all right, give me the penny and I'll go. I'm not going to waste\ntime on a slut like you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe paid him, and the man, throwing down her mattress, left her. She\nflung a filthy word at him as he went. She came out of the room to drag\nthe things in, and the two women in the balcony saw her face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Carai</i>, what an evil face! She looks like a murderess.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA girl came up the stairs at that moment, and her mother called out:\n\"Did you see her, Rosalia?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I asked the <i>gallego</i> where she came from, he says he brought the\nthings from Triana. She promised him four reales and then wouldn't pay.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did he tell you her name?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He didn't know. But in Triana they called her La Cachirra.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe vixen appeared again to fetch a bundle she had forgotten. She\nglanced at the women in the balcony watching her unconcernedly, but said\nnothing. Rosalia shuddered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She frightens me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLa Cachirra was forty, haggard and very thin, with bony hands and\nfingers like a vulture's claws. Her cheeks were sunken and her skin\nwrinkled and yellow. When she opened her mouth, with its pale, heavy\nlips, she showed teeth that were pointed like those of a beast of prey.\nHer hair was black and coarse; she wore it in a clumsy knot, which\nseemed on the point of falling over her shoulders, and in front of each\near fell a straight wisp. Her eyes, deep-set in their sockets, large and\nblack, shone fiercely. Her face bore an expression of such ferocity that\nno one dared come near to speak with her. She kept entirely to herself.\nThe curiosity of the neighbours was aroused. They knew she was very\npoor, for her clothes were wretched. She went out every morning at six\nand did not return till night; but they could not even find out how she\nearned her living. They urged a policeman who lived in the house to make\ninquiries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As long as she doesn't break the peace, I have nothing to do with her,\"\nsaid he.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut in Seville scandal travels quickly and in a few days a mason who\nlived in an upper room brought the news that a friend in Triana knew her\nstory. La Cachirra had only come out of prison one month before, and she\nhad spent seven years there--for murder. She had lodged in a house in\nTriana, but the children, finding out what had happened, threw stones at\nher and called her names; and she, turning upon them with foul words and\nwith blows, had filled the whole place with such tumult that the\nlandlord gave her notice. Cursing him and all who had turned her out, La\nCachirra one morning suddenly disappeared.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And whom did she murder?\" asked Rosalia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They say it was her lover,\" replied the mason.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She can never have had one,\" said Rosalia, with a laugh of scorn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Santa Maria!\" cried Pilar, her mother, \"I hope she won't kill any of\nus. I said she looked like a murderess!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRosalia, shivering, crossed herself. At that moment La Cachirra came in\nfrom her day's work and a sudden oppression fell upon the talkers. They\nmade a movement as if to huddle together and looked nervously at the\nwild-eyed woman. She seemed to see something ominous in their silence\nand gave them a rapid, suspicious glance. The policeman, to make\nconversation, bade her good-evening.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Buena sera</i>,\" she replied, with a scowl, and, passing quickly into her\nroom, slammed the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey heard her lock it. The evil, sullen eyes had cast a gloom over them\nand they talked in whispers as if under a mischievous spell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She has the devil in her,\" said Rosalia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm glad you're here to protect us, Manuel,\" added her mother to the\npoliceman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut La Cachirra seemed indisposed to give trouble. She went her way,\nunbending, never addressing so much as a word to anyone, and brusquely\ncut short every attempt at friendliness. She felt that the neighbours\nhad discovered her secret, the homicide and the long years of\nimprisonment; and the lines in her face grew sterner, the expression of\nher deep-set eyes more inhuman. But gradually the anxiety she had caused\nwas dispelled. Even the garrulous Pilar ceased to pay attention to the\nsilent gaunt figure who occasionally passed through the group sitting in\nthe patio.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say the prison has sent her mad, they say it often does.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut one day an event occurred to revive the gossip. A youth came to the\n<i>reja</i>--the wrought-iron gate that serves as front door to the Sevillan\nhouse--and asked for Antonia Sanchez. Pilar, who was mending a skirt in\nthe patio, looked up at her daughter and shrugged her shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No one of that names lives here,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, she does,\" the young man answered; then, after a pause: \"They call\nher La Cachirra.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah!\" Rosalia opened the gate and pointed to the door. \"She's in there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe youth gave her a smile. She was a pretty girl, with a high colour\nand fine bold eyes. A red carnation threw up the glossy blackness of her\nhair. Her breasts were full and the nipples were prominent under her\nblouse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Blessed be the mother that bore you,\" he said, using a hackneyed\nphrase.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Vaya Usted con Dios</i>, go you with God,\" answered Pilar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe passed on and knocked at the door. The two women looked after him\ncuriously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who can he be?\" asked Pilar. \"La Cachirra's never had a visitor\nbefore.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was no reply to his knocking, and he knocked again. They heard La\nCachirra's rasping voice ask who was there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Madre!</i>\" he cried. \"Mother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a shriek. The door was burst open.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Currito!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe woman threw her arms round his neck and kissed him passionately. She\nfondled him and with a loving gesture stroked his face with both her\nhands. The girl and her mother who watched would never have thought her\ncapable of such tenderness. At last, with little sobs of joy, she\ndragged him into her room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's her son,\" said Rosalia, with surprise. \"Who'd have thought it! And\na fine fellow like that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCurrito had a lean face and white, even teeth; his hair was cut very\nclose, shaved on the temples, and set on the scalp with a truly\nAndalusian perfection. The shadow of his precocious beard showed blue\nbeneath his brown skin. And of course he was a dandy. He had the\nnational love of fine clothes and his trousers were skin-tight; his\nshort jacket and his frilled shirt were as new as new could be. He wore\na broad-brimmed hat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last the door of La Cachirra's room was opened and she appeared,\nhanging on her son's arm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll come again next Sunday?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If nothing stops me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe glanced at Rosalia and, having bidden his mother good-night, nodded\nto her also.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Vaya Usted con Dios!</i>\" said she.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a smile and a flash of her dark eyes. La Cachirra\nintercepted the look; and the sullenness which her intense joy had\ndriven away suddenly darkened her face like a thunder-cloud. She scowled\nfiercely at the handsome girl.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is that your son?\" asked Pilar, when the youth was gone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, he's my son,\" answered La Cachirra gruffly, going back to her\nroom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNothing could soften her, and even when her heart was brimming over with\nhappiness she repelled the overtures of friendship.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's a good-looking fellow,\" said Rosalia; and she thought of him more\nthan once during the next few days.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a terrible love that La Cachirra had for her son. He was all she\nhad in the world and she adored him with a fiery, jealous passion that\ndemanded in return impossible devotion. She wished to be all in all to\nhim. On account of his work they could not live together and it tortured\nher to imagine what he did when he was away from her. She could not bear\nhim to look at a woman and she writhed at the bare idea that he might\npay court to some girl. No amusement is more common in Seville than the\nlong flirtation in which the maid sits at her window half the night\nlong, guarded by iron bars, or stands at the gate, while her lover in\nthe street pours his rapture into her willing ear. La Cachirra asked the\nboy if he had a <i>novia</i>, a sweetheart, aware that so attractive a youth\nmust enjoy the smiles of women, and she knew he lied when he swore he\nspent his evenings at work. But his denials gave her a fierce delight.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen she saw Rosalia's provoking glance and Currito's answering smile,\nrage leapt to her throat. She had hated her neighbours before, because\nthey were happy and she was wretched, because they knew her terrible\nsecret; but now she hated them more, already fancying, half crazily,\nthat they were conspiring to rob her of her son. On the following\nSunday, in the afternoon, La Cachirra came out of her room, crossed the\npatio and stood at the gate. This was a proceeding so unusual that the\nneighbours commented upon it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you know why she's there?\" said Rosalia, with a stifled laugh.\n\"Her precious son is coming, and she doesn't want us to see him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does she think we'll eat him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCurrito arrived and his mother took him quickly to her room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's as jealous of him as if he was her lover,\" said Pilar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRosalia looked at the closed door, laughing again, and her shining eyes\nwere filled with mischief. It occurred to her that it would be very\namusing to have a word with Currito. Rosalia's white teeth gleamed at\nthe thought of La Cachirra's anger. She stationed herself at the gate,\nso that the pair, when they came out, could not help crossing her; but\nLa Cachirra, seeing the girl, moved to the other side of her son so that\nnot even a glance should pass between them. Rosalia shrugged her\nshoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You won't beat me so easily as that,\" she thought.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Sunday after, when La Cachirra took up her place at the gate,\nRosalia went out into the street and strolled along in the direction\nfrom which she guessed he would come. In a minute she saw Currito, and\nwalked on, elaborately ignoring him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hola!\" said he, stopping.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it you? I thought you were afraid to speak to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid of nothing,\" he answered boastingly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe walked on, as if she wanted him to leave her; but she knew very well\nhe would do no such thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where are you going?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What has that to do with you, Currito? Go to your mother, my son, or\nshe'll beat you. You're afraid to look at me when she's with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What nonsense.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, <i>vaya Usted con Dios</i>! I have commissions.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went off rather sheepishly, and Rosalia laughed to herself. She was\nin the courtyard once more when he passed through with La Cachirra on\nhis way out; and this time, shamed into courage, he stopped and said\ngood-night. La Cachirra turned red with anger.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come, Currito,\" she cried, with a rasping voice, \"what are you waiting\nfor?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went away, and the woman stopped a moment in front of Rosalia as if\nshe were going to speak, but, with a visible effort, she restrained\nherself, and went back to her dark, silent room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA few days later was the feast of San Isidore, the patron saint of\nSeville, and to celebrate the holiday the mason and one or two others\nhad put a string of Chinese lanterns in the patio. They glowed warmly in\nthe clear summer night. The sky was soft against the shining stars. The\npeople of the house were gathered in the middle of the patio, sitting on\nchairs; and the women, some with babies at their breasts, fanned\nthemselves with little paper fans, interrupting their ceaseless\nchattering to fling a word of abuse at some older child who was making a\nnuisance of himself. The cool air was very pleasant after the day's\nbreathless heat. Those who had been to the bull-fight were telling the\nless fortunate all about it. They described with precise detail a\nwonderful feat that Belmonte, the famous matador, had performed. With\ntheir vivid imaginations, the particulars gained every minute in variety\nand colour, so that it appeared that never in the history of Seville had\nthere been a more excellent <i>corrida</i>. Everyone was present but La\nCachirra, and in her room they saw the light of a solitary candle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And her son?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's in there,\" answered Pilar. \"I saw him pass an hour ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He must be amusing himself,\" said Rosalia, with a laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, don't bother about La Cachirra,\" said another. \"Give us a dance,\nRosalia.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, yes,\" they cried. \"Go on, my girl. You dance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn Spain they love dancing and they love to look at dancing. Years and\nyears ago it was said that there was never a Spanish woman that was not\nborn to dance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe chairs were quickly set in a ring. The mason and the tram conductor\nfetched their guitars. Rosalia got her castanets, and stepping forward\nwith another girl, began.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCurrito, in the poky room, pricked up his ears when he heard the music.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're dancing,\" he said, and an itching shot down his limbs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked through the curtain and saw the group in the mellow light of\nthe Chinese lanterns. He saw the two girls dancing. Rosalia wore her\nSunday clothes, and, as is customary, she was heavily powdered. A\nsplendid carnation gleamed in her hair. Currito's heart beat quickly.\nLove in Spain grows fast, and he had thought often of the handsome girl\nsince that day on which he first spoke to her. He moved towards the\ndoor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you doing?\" asked La Cachirra.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going to look at them dance. You never wish me to amuse myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's Rosalia you want to see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe pushed her away as she tried to stop him, and joined the group that\nwatched the dancers. La Cachirra followed a step or two, and then stood,\nhalf hidden by the gloom, with fury gnawing at her heart. Rosalia saw\nhim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Aren't you frightened to look at me?\" she whispered, as she passed him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe dancing had made her light-headed and she felt no fear of La\nCachirra. When the measure ended and her partner sank into a chair,\nRosalia marched up to Currito and stood in front of him, upright, with\nher head thrown back and her breast heaving with the rapid motion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course, you don't know how to dance,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, come then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe smiled provokingly, but he hesitated. He looked over his shoulder at\nhis mother, whom he divined, rather than saw, in the darkness. Rosalia\ncaught the glance and its meaning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you afraid?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What should I be afraid of?\" he asked with a shrug of the shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe stepped into the ring. The guitarists strummed away and the onlookers\nrhythmically clapped their hands, punctuating the time with an\noccasional cry of Olé. A girl gave Currito a pair of castanets and the\npair began to dance. They heard a little hiss, as of a serpent in the\ndarkness, and Rosalia, quite reckless now, looked with a laugh at the\nface, ghastly white, that gleamed from the shadows. La Cachirra did not\nmove. She watched the movements of the dance, the swaying of the bodies,\nthe intricate steps; she saw Rosalia lean back with a graceful gesture\nand smile in Currito's face as he wound about her, clapping his\ncastanets. Her eyes glowed like coals of fire and she felt them burning\nin the sockets; but no one noticed her, and she gave a groan of rage.\nThe dance came to an end, and Rosalia, smiling with pleasure at the\napplause, told Currito she did not know he could dance so well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLa Cachirra flung herself into her room and bolted the door. She gave no\nanswer when Currito came and bade her open.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I shall go home,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer heart bled with pain, but she would not speak. He was all she had,\nall she loved in the world; and yet she hated him. She could not sleep\nthat night, but lay thinking, half-madly, that they were robbing her of\nher son. In the morning she did not go to work, but lay in wait for\nRosalia. The girl came out at last, rather bedraggled after the night's\nfestivities, and she started when La Cachirra suddenly faced her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you want with my son?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean?\" replied Rosalia, assuming an expression of surprise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLa Cachirra quivered with passion and she bit her hand to keep herself\nquiet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, you know what I mean. You're stealing him from me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think I want your son? Keep him away from me. I can't help it if\nhe runs after me wherever I go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's a lie!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ask him!\" And now Rosalia's voice was so scornful that La Cachirra\ncould hardly contain herself. \"He waits an hour in the street to see me.\nWhy don't you keep him to yourself?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You lie, you lie! You throw yourself in his way.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If I wanted lovers I could get them without asking. I don't want the\nson of a murderess.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen everything grew confused to La Cachirra; the blood leaped to her\nhead and choked her eyes. She sprang at Rosalia and tore her hair. The\ngirl gave a shrill cry and sought to defend herself, but immediately a\npasser-by wrenched them apart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you don't leave Currito alone, I'll kill you!\" cried La Cachirra.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think I'm frightened? Keep him from me if you can. You fool,\ndon't you see that he loves me better than his eyes?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now then, go away,\" said the man. \"Don't answer her, Rosalia.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLa Cachirra gave a little roar of passion, like a wild beast baulked of\nits prey, and pushed past into the street.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the dance had left Currito madly in love with Rosalia, and all next\nday he thought of her red lips; the light of her eyes shone in his heart\nand filled him with enchantment. He passionately desired her. At\nnightfall he wandered towards the Macarena and presently found himself\nat her house. He waited in the darkness of the porch till he saw her in\nthe patio. At the other end burned his mother's lonely light.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Rosalia,\" he called in a low voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe turned, stifling a cry of surprise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why are you here to-day?\" she whispered, going towards him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I couldn't keep away from you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why?\" she smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Because I love you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you know your mother nearly killed me this morning?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd with the embellishments necessary to the Andalusian temperament, she\nrelated the occurrence, omitting, however, the final taunt which had\nenraged La Cachirra beyond endurance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's got the temper of the devil,\" said Currito; and then, with\nbravado: \"I shall tell her that you're my sweetheart.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She will be pleased,\" said Rosalia ironically.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you come to the <i>reja</i> to-morrow?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave a little chuckle, for he knew by her tone that she would. He\nswaggered even more than usual when he walked through the Sierpes on his\nway home. She was waiting for him when he came next day and, as is the\nway with lovers in Seville, they talked for hours under their breath,\nwith the iron gate between them, and it never even occurred to Currito\nthat it was a needless impediment. When he asked Rosalia if she loved\nhim she answered with a little amorous sigh. They tried to see the\npassion that burnt hotly in one another's eyes. Then he went every\nnight.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut fearing that his mother knew of his visits, Currito did not go to\nsee her on the following Sunday. The wretched woman waited for him with\nan aching heart. She was ready to fall on her knees and beg him to\nforgive her, but then, when he did not come, she hated him; she would\nhave liked to see him dead at her feet. Her heart sank when she thought\nthat another week must pass before she could even hope to see him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe week passed and still he did not come. She could not bear it.\nAnguish, anguish! She loved him as no sweetheart could ever love him.\nShe told herself that this was Rosalia's doing and when she thought of\nher, rage filled her heart. At last Currito plucked up his courage and\nwent to see his mother; but she had waited too long. It seemed as though\nher love was dead. She pushed him away when he wanted to kiss her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why haven't you come before?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You locked the door on me. I thought you didn't want me!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Was it only that? Had you no other reason?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've been busy,\" he said, shrugging his shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Busy? An idle loafer like you. What have you been doing? You wouldn't\nhave been too busy to come and see Rosalia.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why did you hit her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How do you know I hit her? Have you seen her?\" La Cachirra strode up to\nher son; her eyes flashed. \"She called me a murderess.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what of it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What of it?\" she screamed, so that they heard her in the patio. \"And if\nI am a murderess--it was for you. Yes, I killed Pepe Santi; but it was\nbecause he was beating you. It was for your sake that I lay in prison\nfor seven years--for seven years. Oh, you fool, you think she cares for\nyou, and every night she spends hours at the gate.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know,\" Currito answered with a grin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLa Cachirra started violently. She shot a puzzled look at him and then\nshe understood. She gasped with pain and wrath; she clutched at her\nheart as though the agony were too intense to bear.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've been coming every night to the <i>reja</i> and you never came near\nme? Oh, how cruel! I've done everything in the world for you. Do you\nthink I loved Pepe Santi? I endured his blows so that I could give you\nbread; and I killed him when he beat you. Oh, God, I only lived for you.\nBut for the thought of you I would have died rather than suffer those\nyears of prison.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come, woman, be reasonable. I'm twenty. What d'you expect? If it wasn't\nRosalia it would be another.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You beast. I hate you. Get out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe pushed him violently to the door. Currito shrugged his shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You needn't think I want to stay.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe walked jauntily through the patio and slammed the iron gate behind\nhim. La Cachirra stalked to and fro in her tiny room. The hours passed\nslowly. For a long while she remained at the window, watching with the\nhorrible steadfastness of a savage beast ready to spring. She stood\nmotionless, repressing the convulsive restlessness that tore at her\nheart-strings. There was a clapping of hands at the <i>reja</i> as a signal\nthat someone was without, and she peered forward with panting mouth, her\nfiery eyes almost starting from her head. But it was only the mason. She\nwaited longer, and Pilar, Rosalia's mother, came in and walked slowly up\nthe stairs to her room. La Cachirra clutched at her throat to relieve\nthe intolerable oppression of her breath. Still she waited. Now and then\nan extraordinary quiver travelled through all her limbs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last! There was a clap of light hands at the gate, and a voice above\ncalled out: \"Who is it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Peace!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLa Cachirra recognised Rosalia's voice. She gave a gasp of triumph. The\ndoor was opened from above, and Rosalia, entering, crossed the courtyard\nwith a buoyant and easy step. The joy of life was in her every motion.\nShe was about to put her foot on the stair when La Cachirra sprang\nforward and stopped her. She caught hold of her arm and the girl could\nnot shake herself free.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you want?\" said Rosalia. \"Let me pass.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What have you been doing with my son?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me pass, or I shall call out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it true that you meet at the <i>reja</i> every night?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mother, help! Antonio!\" Rosalia cried out shrilly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Answer me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if you want the truth, you can have it. He's going to marry me.\nHe loves me, and I--I love him with all my heart.\" She turned on La\nCachirra, trying to free herself from the vicious grip. \"D'you think you\ncan prevent us? D'you think he's frightened of you? He hates you, he\ntold me so. He wishes you'd never come out of prison.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He told you that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLa Cachirra shrank back. Rosalia pursued the advantage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, he told me that; and he told me much more. He told me that you\nmurdered Pepe Santi; and that you were in prison for seven years; and he\nwished you were dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRosalia hissed the words venomously, laughing with shrill voice when she\nsaw the wretched woman shrink as though struck by palpable blows.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And you ought to be proud that I don't refuse to marry the son of a\nmurderess.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen, giving La Cachirra a push, she leapt to the stairs; but the\nmovement revived the woman, stunned by the horrible taunts, and with a\ncry of brutal rage she sprang upon Rosalia and caught her by the\nshoulders and dragged her down. Rosalia turned and hit her in the face.\nLa Cachirra drew a knife from her bosom, and with an oath buried it in\nthe girl's neck. Rosalia shrieked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mother, she's killed me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe fell to the bottom of the stairs and lay huddled up on the stones.\nBlood made a little pool on the ground.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHalf a dozen doors were flung open at the despairing cry, and people\nrushed to seize La Cachirra; but she backed against the wall and faced\nthem, with an expression of such ferocity on her face that no one dared\napproach her. The hesitation was momentary, but Pilar ran from the\nbalcony shrieking, and the common attention for an instant was\ndistracted. La Cachirra saw the opportunity and ran forward. She reached\nher room and locked and bolted the door behind her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSuddenly the court was filled with people. Pilar with loud dreadful\ncries flung herself down on her daughter and would not let herself be\ndragged away. Someone rushed for a doctor and someone else went for the\npolice. The crowd surged in from the street and collected round the\ndoor. The doctor hurried in with a black bag in his hand. When the\npolice came a dozen people at once excitedly explained what had\nhappened. They pointed to the door of La Cachirra's room, and the police\nbroke in. There was a scuffle and they came out with La Cachirra\nhandcuffed. The mob rushed forward, but the police surrounded her and\nwith their scabbards beat the people off; but they shook their fists and\nhurled curses at her. She looked at them scornfully. She deigned to make\nno answer. Her eyes shone with triumph. The policemen led her through\nthe patio and they passed by the body of Rosalia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is she dead?\" asked La Cachirra.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes,\" the doctor answered gravely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thanks be to God!\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nIt is not often that anyone entering a great city for the first time has\nthe luck to witness such an incident as engaged Shelley's attention when\nhe drove into Naples. A youth ran out of a shop pursued by a man armed\nwith a knife. The man overtook him and with one blow in the neck laid\nhim dead on the road. Shelley had a tender heart. He didn't look upon it\nas a bit of local colour; he was seized with horror and indignation. But\nwhen he expressed his emotions to a Calabrian priest who was travelling\nwith him, a fellow of gigantic strength and stature, the priest laughed\nheartily and attempted to quiz him. Shelley says he never felt such an\ninclination to beat anyone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI have never seen anything so exciting as that, but the first time I\nwent to Algeciras I had an experience that seemed to me far from\nordinary. Algeciras was then an untidy, neglected town. I arrived\nsomewhat late at night and went to an inn on the quay. It was rather\nshabby, but it had a fine view of Gibraltar, solid and matter-of-fact,\nacross the bay. The moon was full. The office was on the first floor,\nand a slatternly maid, when I asked for a room, took me upstairs. The\nlandlord was playing cards. He seemed little pleased to see me. He\nlooked me up and down, curtly gave me a number, and then, taking no\nfurther notice of me, went on with his game.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen the maid had shown me to my room I asked her what I could have to\neat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What you like,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI knew well enough the unreality of the seeming profusion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What have you got in the house?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can have eggs and ham.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe look of the hotel had led me to guess that I should get little else.\nThe maid led me to a narrow room with white-washed walls and a low\nceiling in which was a long table laid already for the next day's\nluncheon. With his back to the door sat a tall man, huddled over a\n<i>brasero</i>, the round brass dish of hot ashes which is erroneously\nsupposed to give sufficient warmth for the temperate winter of\nAndalusia. I sat down at table and waited for my scanty meal. I gave the\nstranger an idle glance. He was looking at me, but meeting my eyes he\nquickly turned away. I waited for my eggs. When at last the maid brought\nthem he looked up again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want you to wake me in time for the first boat,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Si, señor.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis accent told me that English was his native tongue, and the breadth\nof his build, his strongly marked features, led me to suppose him a\nnortherner. The hardy Scot is far more often found in Spain than the\nEnglishman. Whether you go to the rich mines of Rio Tinto, or to the\nbodegas of Jerez, to Seville or to Cadiz, it is the leisurely speech of\nbeyond the Tweed that you hear. You will meet Scotsmen in the olive\ngroves of Carmona, on the railway between Algeciras and Bobadilla, and\neven in the remote cork woods of Merida.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI finished eating and went over to the dish of burning ashes. It was\nmidwinter and the windy passage across the bay had chilled my blood. The\nman pushed his chair away as I drew mine forwards.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't move,\" I said. \"There's heaps of room for two.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI lit a cigar and offered one to him. In Spain the Havana from Gib is\nnever unwelcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't mind if I do,\" he said, stretching out his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI recognised the singing speech of Glasgow. But the stranger was not\ntalkative, and my efforts at conversation broke down before his\nmonosyllables. We smoked in silence. He was even bigger than I had\nthought, with great broad shoulders and ungainly limbs; his face was\nsunburned, his hair short and grizzled. His features were hard; mouth,\nears and nose were large and heavy and his skin much wrinkled. His blue\neyes were pale. He was constantly pulling his ragged, grey moustache. It\nwas a nervous gesture that I found faintly irritating. Presently I felt\nthat he was looking at me, and the intensity of his stare grew so\nirksome that I glanced up expecting him, as before, to drop his eyes. He\ndid, indeed, for a moment, but then raised them again. He inspected me\nfrom under his long, bushy eyebrows.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Just come from Gib?\" he asked suddenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going to-morrow--on my way home. Thank God.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe said the last two words so fiercely that I smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you like Spain?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Spain's all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you been here long?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Too long. Too long.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe spoke with a kind of gasp. I was surprised at the emotion my casual\ninquiry seemed to excite in him. He sprang to his feet and walked\nbackwards and forwards. He stamped to and fro like a caged beast,\npushing aside a chair that stood in his way, and now and again repeated\nthe words in a groan. \"Too long. Too long.\" I sat still. I was\nembarrassed. To give myself countenance I stirred the <i>brasero</i> to bring\nthe hotter ashes to the top, and he stood suddenly still, towering over\nme, as though my movement had brought back my existence to his notice.\nThen he sat down heavily in his chair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you think I'm queer?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not more than most people,\" I smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't see anything strange in me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe leant forward as he spoke so that I might see him well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd say so if you did, wouldn't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I would.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI couldn't quite understand what all this meant. I wondered if he was\ndrunk. For two or three minutes he didn't say anything and I had no wish\nto interrupt the silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's your name?\" he asked suddenly. I told him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mine's Robert Morrison.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Scotch?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Glasgow. I've been in this blasted country for years. Got any baccy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI gave him my pouch and he filled his pipe. He lit it from a piece of\nburning charcoal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't stay any longer. I've stayed too long. Too long.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had an impulse to jump up again and walk up and down, but he resisted\nit, clinging to his chair. I saw on his face the effort he was making. I\njudged that his restlessness was due to chronic alcoholism. I find\ndrunks very boring, and I made up my mind to take an early opportunity\nof slipping off to bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've been managing some olive groves,\" he went on. \"I'm here working\nfor the Glasgow and South of Spain Olive Oil Company Limited.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We've got a new process for refining oil, you know. Properly treated,\nSpanish oil is every bit as good as Lucca. And we can sell it cheaper.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe spoke in a dry, matter-of-fact, business-like way. He chose his words\nwith Scotch precision. He seemed perfectly sober.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, Ecija is more or less the centre of the olive trade, and we\nhad a Spaniard there to look after the business. But I found he was\nrobbing us right and left, so I had to turn him out. I used to live in\nSeville; it was more convenient for shipping the oil. However, I found I\ncouldn't get a trustworthy man to be at Ecija, so last year I went there\nmyself. D'you know it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The firm has got a big estate two miles from the town, just outside the\nvillage of San Lorenzo, and it's got a fine house on it. It's on the\ncrest of a hill, rather pretty to look at, all white, you know, and\nstraggling, with a couple of storks perched on the roof. No one lived\nthere, and I thought it would save the rent of a place in town if I\ndid.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must have been a bit lonely,\" I remarked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRobert Morrison smoked on for a minute or two in silence. I wondered\nwhether there was any point in what he was telling me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI looked at my watch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In a hurry?\" he asked sharply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not particularly. It's getting late.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what of it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you didn't see many people?\" I said, going back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not many. I lived there with an old man and his wife who looked after\nme, and sometimes I used to go down to the village and play <i>tresillo</i>\nwith Fernandez, the chemist, and one or two men who met at his shop. I\nused to shoot a bit and ride.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It doesn't sound such a bad life to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd been there two years last spring. By God, I've never known such\nheat as we had in May. No one could do a thing. The labourers just lay\nabout in the shade and slept. Sheep died and some of the animals went\nmad. Even the oxen couldn't work. They stood around with their backs all\nhumped up and gasped for breath. That blasted sun beat down and the\nglare was so awful, you felt your eyes would shoot out of your head. The\nearth cracked and crumbled, and the crops frizzled. The olives went to\nrack and ruin. It was simply hell. One couldn't get a wink of sleep. I\nwent from room to room, trying to get a breath of air. Of course I kept\nthe windows shut and had the floors watered, but that didn't do any\ngood. The nights were just as hot as the days. It was like living in an\noven.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At last I thought I'd have a bed made up for me downstairs on the north\nside of the house in a room that was never used because in ordinary\nweather it was damp. I had an idea that I might get a few hours' sleep\nthere at all events. Anyhow it was worth trying. But it was no damned\ngood; it was a wash-out. I turned and tossed and my bed was so hot that\nI couldn't stand it. I got up and opened the doors that led to the\nverandah and walked out. It was a glorious night. The moon was so bright\nthat I swear you could read a book by it. Did I tell you the house was\non the crest of a hill? I leant against the parapet and looked at the\nolive-trees. It was like the sea. I suppose that's what made me think of\nhome. I thought of the cool breeze in the fir-trees and the racket of\nthe streets in Glasgow. Believe it or not, I could smell them, and I\ncould smell the sea. By God, I'd have given every bob I had in the world\nfor an hour of that air. They say it's a foul climate in Glasgow. Don't\nyou believe it. I like the rain and the grey sky and that yellow sea and\nthe waves. I forgot that I was in Spain, in the middle of the olive\ncountry, and I opened my mouth and took a long breath as though I were\nbreathing in the sea-fog.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And then all of a sudden I heard a sound. It was a man's voice. Not\nloud, you know, low. It seemed to creep through the silence like--well,\nI don't know what it was like. It surprised me. I couldn't think who\ncould be down there in the olives at that hour. It was past midnight. It\nwas a chap laughing. A funny sort of laugh. I suppose you'd call it a\nchuckle. It seemed to crawl up the hill--disjointedly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMorrison looked at me to see how I took the odd word he used to express\na sensation that he didn't know how to describe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I mean, it seemed to shoot up in little jerks, something like shooting\nstones out of a pail, I leant forward and stared. With the full moon it\nwas almost as light as day, but I'm dashed if I could see a thing. The\nsound stopped, but I kept on looking at where it had come from in case\nsomebody moved. And in a minute it started off again, but louder. You\ncouldn't have called it a chuckle any more, it was a real belly laugh.\nIt just rang through the night. I wondered it didn't wake my servants.\nIt sounded like someone who was roaring drunk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Who's there?' I shouted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The only answer I got was a roar of laughter. I don't mind telling you\nI was getting a bit annoyed. I had half a mind to go down and see what\nit was all about. I wasn't going to let some drunken swine kick up a row\nlike that on my place in the middle of the night. And then suddenly\nthere was a yell. By God, I was startled. Then cries. The man had\nlaughed with a deep bass voice, but his cries were--shrill, like a pig\nhaving his throat cut.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'My God,' I cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I jumped over the parapet and ran down towards the sound. I thought\nsomebody was being killed. There was silence and then one piercing\nshriek. After that sobbing and moaning. I'll tell you what it sounded\nlike, it sounded like someone at the point of death. There was a long\ngroan and then nothing. Silence. I ran from place to place. I couldn't\nfind anyone. At last I climbed the hill again and went back to my room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can imagine how much sleep I got that night. As soon as it was\nlight, I looked out of the window in the direction from which the row\nhad come and I was surprised to see a little white house in a sort of\ndale among the olives. The ground on that side didn't belong to us and\nI'd never been through it. I hardly ever went to that part of the house\nand so I'd never seen the house before. I asked José who lived there. He\ntold me that a madman had inhabited it, with his brother and a servant.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, was that the explanation?\" I said. \"Not a very nice neighbour.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Scot bent over quickly and seized my wrist. He thrust his face into\nmine and his eyes were starting out of his head with terror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The madman had been dead for twenty years,\" he whispered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe let go my wrist and leant back in his chair panting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I went down to the house and walked all round it. The windows were\nbarred and shuttered and the door was locked. I knocked. I shook the\nhandle and rang the bell. I heard it tinkle, but no one came. It was a\ntwo-storey house and I looked up. The shutters were tight closed, and\nthere wasn't a sign of life anywhere.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what sort of condition was the house in?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, rotten. The whitewash had worn off the walls and there was\npractically no paint left on the door or the shutters. Some of the tiles\noff the roof were lying on the ground. They looked as though they'd been\nblown away in a gale.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Queer,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I went to my friend Fernandez, the chemist, and he told me the same\nstory as José. I asked about the madman and Fernandez said that no one\never saw him. He was more or less comatose ordinarily, but now and then\nhe had an attack of acute mania and then he could be heard from ever so\nfar laughing his head off and then crying. It used to scare people. He\ndied in one of his attacks and his keepers cleared out at once. No one\nhad ever dared to live in the house since.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't tell Fernandez what I'd heard. I thought he'd only laugh at\nme. I stayed up that night and kept watch. But nothing happened. There\nwasn't a sound. I waited about till dawn and then I went to bed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And you never heard anything more?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not for a month. The drought continued and I went on sleeping in the\nlumber-room at the back. One night I was fast asleep, when something\nseemed to happen to me; I don't exactly know how to describe it, it was\na funny feeling as though someone had given me a little nudge, to warn\nme, and suddenly I was wide awake. I lay there in my bed and then in the\nsame way as before I heard a long, low gurgle, like a man enjoying an\nold joke. It came from away down in the valley and it got louder. It was\na great bellow of laughter. I jumped out of bed and went to the window.\nMy legs began to tremble. It was horrible to stand there and listen to\nthe shouts of laughter that rang through the night. Then there was the\npause, and after that a shriek of pain and that ghastly sobbing. It\ndidn't sound human. I mean, you might have thought it was an animal\nbeing tortured. I don't mind telling you I was scared stiff. I couldn't\nhave moved if I'd wanted to. After a time the sounds stopped, not\nsuddenly, but dying away little by little, I strained my ears, but I\ncouldn't hear a thing. I crept back to bed and hid my face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I remembered then that Fernandez had told me that the madman's attacks\nonly came at intervals. The rest of the time he was quite quiet.\nApathetic, Fernandez said. I wondered if the fits of mania came\nregularly. I reckoned out how long it had been between the two attacks\nI'd heard. Twenty-eight days. It didn't take me long to put two and two\ntogether; it was quite obvious that it was the full moon that set him\noff. I'm not a nervous man really and I made up my mind to get to the\nbottom of it, so I looked out in the calendar which day the moon would\nbe full next and that night I didn't go to bed. I cleaned my revolver\nand loaded it. I prepared a lantern and sat down on the parapet of my\nhouse to wait. I felt perfectly cool. To tell you the truth, I was\nrather pleased with myself because I didn't feel scared. There was a bit\nof a wind, and it whistled about the roof. It rustled over the leaves of\nthe olive-trees like waves swishing on the pebbles of the beach. The\nmoon shone on the white walls of the house in the hollow. I felt\nparticularly cheery.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At last I heard a little sound, the sound I knew, and I almost laughed.\nI was right; it was the full moon and the attacks came as regular as\nclockwork. That was all to the good. I threw myself over the wall into\nthe olive grove and ran straight to the house. The chuckling grew louder\nas I came near. I got to the house and looked up. There was no light\nanywhere. I put my ears to the door and listened. I heard the madman\nsimply laughing his bloody head off. I beat on the door with my fist and\nI pulled the bell. The sound of it seemed to amuse him. He roared with\nlaughter. I knocked again, louder and louder, and the more I knocked the\nmore he laughed. Then I shouted at the top of my voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Open the blasted door, or I'll break it down.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I stepped back and kicked the latch with all my might. I flung myself\nat the door with the whole weight of my body. It cracked. Then I put all\nmy strength into it and the damned thing smashed open.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I took the revolver out of my pocket and held my lantern in the other\nhand. The laughter sounded louder now that the door was opened. I\nstepped in. The stink nearly knocked me down. I mean, just think, the\nwindows hadn't been opened for twenty years. The row was enough to raise\nthe dead, but for a moment I didn't know where it was coming from. The\nwalls seemed to throw the sound backwards and forwards. I pushed open a\ndoor by my side and went into a room. It was bare and white and there\nwasn't a stick of furniture in it. The sound was louder and I followed\nit. I went into another room, but there was nothing there. I opened a\ndoor and found myself at the foot of a staircase. The madman was\nlaughing just over my head. I walked up, cautiously, you know, I wasn't\ntaking any risks, and at the top of the stairs there was a passage. I\nwalked along it, throwing my light ahead of me, and I came to a room at\nthe end. I stopped. He was in there. I was only separated from the sound\nby a thin door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was awful to hear it. A shiver passed through me and I cursed myself\nbecause I began to tremble. It wasn't like a human being at all. By\nJove, I very nearly took to my heels and ran. I had to clench my teeth\nto force myself to stay. But I simply couldn't bring myself to turn the\nhandle. And then the laughter was cut, cut with a knife you'd have said,\nand I heard a hiss of pain. I hadn't heard that before, it was too low\nto carry to my place, and then a gasp.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Ay!' I heard the man speak in Spanish. 'You're killing me. Take it\naway. O God, help me!'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He screamed. The brutes were torturing him. I flung open the door and\nburst in. The draught blew a shutter back and the moon streamed in so\nbright that it dimmed my lantern. In my ears, as clearly as I hear you\nspeak and as close, I heard the wretched chap's groans. It was awful,\nmoaning and sobbing, and frightful gasps. No one could survive that. He\nwas at the point of death. I tell you I heard his broken, choking cries\nright in my ears. And the room was empty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRobert Morrison sank back in his chair. That huge solid man had\nstrangely the look of a clay figure in a studio. You felt that if you\npushed him he would fall over in a heap on to the floor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And then?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took a rather dirty handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped his\nforehead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I felt I didn't much want to sleep in that room on the north side, so,\nheat or no heat, I moved back to my own quarters. Well, exactly four\nweeks later, about two in the morning, I was waked up by the madman's\nchuckle. It was almost at my elbow. I don't mind telling you that my\nnerve was a bit shaken by then, so next time the blighter was due to\nhave an attack, next time the moon was full, I mean, I got Fernandez to\ncome and spend the night with me. I didn't tell him anything. I kept him\nup playing cards till two in the morning, and then I heard it again. I\nasked him if he heard anything. 'Nothing,' he said. 'There's somebody\nlaughing,' I said. 'You're drunk, man,' he said, and he began laughing\ntoo. That was too much. 'Shut up, you fool,' I said. The laughter grew\nlouder and louder. I cried out. I tried to shut it out by putting my\nhands to my ears, but it wasn't a damned bit of good. I heard it and I\nheard the scream of pain. Fernandez thought I was mad. He didn't dare\nsay so, because he knew I'd have killed him. He said he'd go to bed, and\nin the morning I found he'd slunk away. His bed hadn't been slept in.\nHe'd taken himself off when he left me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After that I couldn't stop in Ecija. I put a factor there and went back\nto Seville. I felt myself pretty safe there, but as the time came near I\nbegan to get scared. Of course I told myself not to be a damned fool,\nbut, you know, I damned well couldn't help myself. The fact is, I was\nafraid the sounds had followed me, and I knew if I heard them in Seville\nI'd go on hearing them all my life. I've got as much courage as any man,\nbut damn it all, there are limits to everything. Flesh and blood\ncouldn't stand it. I knew I'd go stark staring mad. I got in such a\nstate that I began drinking, the suspense was so awful, and I used to\nlie awake counting the days. And at last I knew it'd come. And it came.\nI heard those sounds in Seville--sixty miles away from Ecija.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI didn't know what to say. I was silent for a while.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When did you hear the sounds last?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Four weeks ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI looked up quickly. I was startled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What d'you mean by that? It's not full moon to-night?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave me a dark, angry look. He opened his mouth to speak and then\nstopped as though he couldn't. You would have said his vocal cords were\nparalysed, and it was with a strange croak that at last he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, it is.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe stared at me and his pale blue eyes seemed to shine red. I have never\nseen in a man's face a look of such terror. He got up quickly and\nstalked out of the room, slamming the door behind him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI must admit that I didn't sleep any too well that night myself.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Skinner liked to be in good time. She was already dressed, in black\nsilk as befitted her age and the mourning she wore for her son-in-law,\nand now she put on her toque. She was a little uncertain about it, since\nthe egrets' feathers which adorned it might very well arouse in some of\nthe friends she would certainly meet at the party acid expostulations;\nand of course it was shocking to kill those beautiful white birds, in\nthe mating season too, for the sake of their feathers; but there they\nwere, so pretty and stylish, and it would have been silly to refuse\nthem, and it would have hurt her son-in-law's feelings. He had brought\nthem all the way from Borneo and he expected her to be so pleased with\nthem. Kathleen had made herself rather unpleasant about them, she must\nwish she hadn't now, after what had happened, but Kathleen had never\nreally liked Harold. Mrs. Skinner, standing at her dressing-table,\nplaced the toque on her head, it was after all the only nice hat she\nhad, and put in a pin with a large jet knob. If anybody spoke to her\nabout the egrets she had her answer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know it's dreadful,\" she would say, \"and I wouldn't dream of buying\nthem, but my poor son-in-law brought them back the last time he was home\non leave.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat would explain her possession of them and excuse their use. Everyone\nhad been very kind. Mrs. Skinner took a clean handkerchief from a drawer\nand sprinkled a little <i>Eau de Cologne</i> on it. She never used scent, and\nshe had always thought it rather fast, but <i>Eau de Cologne</i> was so\nrefreshing. She was very nearly ready now, and her eyes wandered out of\nthe window behind her looking-glass. Canon Heywood had a beautiful day\nfor his garden-party. It was warm and the sky was blue; the trees had\nnot yet lost the fresh green of the spring. She smiled as she saw her\nlittle granddaughter in the strip of garden behind the house busily\nraking her very own flower-bed. Mrs. Skinner wished Joan were not quite\nso pale, it was a mistake to have kept her so long in the tropics; and\nshe was so grave for her age, you never saw her run about; she played\nquiet games of her own invention and watered her garden. Mrs. Skinner\ngave the front of her dress a little pat, took up her gloves, and went\ndownstairs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKathleen was at the writing-table in the window busy with lists she was\nmaking, for she was honorary secretary of the Ladies' Golf Club, and\nwhen there were competitions had a good deal to do. But she too was\nready for the party.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see you've put on your jumper after all,\" said Mrs. Skinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey had discussed at luncheon whether Kathleen should wear her jumper\nor her black chiffon. The jumper was black and white, and Kathleen\nthought it rather smart, but it was hardly mourning. Millicent, however,\nwas in favour of it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no reason why we should all look as if we'd just come from a\nfuneral,\" she said. \"Harold's been dead eight months.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo Mrs. Skinner it seemed rather unfeeling to talk like that. Millicent\nwas strange since her return from Borneo.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not going to leave off your weeds yet, darling?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent did not give a direct answer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"People don't wear mourning in the way they used,\" she said. She paused\na little and when she went on there was a tone in her voice which Mrs.\nSkinner thought quite peculiar. It was plain that Kathleen noticed it\ntoo, for she gave her sister a curious look. \"I'm sure Harold wouldn't\nwish me to wear mourning for him indefinitely.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dressed early because I wanted to say something to Millicent,\" said\nKathleen in reply to her mother's observation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKathleen did not explain. But she put her lists aside and with knitted\nbrows read for the second time a letter from a lady who complained that\nthe committee had most unfairly marked down her handicap from\ntwenty-four to eighteen. It requires a good deal of tact to be honorary\nsecretary to a ladies' golf club. Mrs. Skinner began to put on her new\ngloves. The sun-blinds kept the room cool and dark. She looked at the\ngreat wooden hornbill, gaily painted, which Harold had left in her\nsafekeeping; and it seemed a little odd and barbaric to her, but he had\nset much store on it. It had some religious significance and Canon\nHeywood had been greatly struck by it. On the wall, over the sofa, were\nMalay weapons, she forgot what they were called, and here and there on\noccasional tables pieces of silver and brass which Harold at various\ntimes had sent to them. She had liked Harold and involuntarily her eyes\nsought his photograph which stood on the piano with photographs of her\ntwo daughters, her grandchild, her sister and her sister's son.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, Kathleen, where's Harold's photograph?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKathleen looked round. It no longer stood in its place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Someone's taken it away,\" said Kathleen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSurprised and puzzled, she got up and went over to the piano. The\nphotographs had been rearranged so that no gap should show.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps Millicent wanted to have it in her bedroom,\" said Mrs. Skinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have noticed it. Besides, Millicent has several photographs of\nHarold. She keeps them locked up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Skinner had thought it very peculiar that her daughter should have\nno photographs of Harold in her room. Indeed she had spoken of it once,\nbut Millicent had made no reply. Millicent had been strangely silent\nsince she came back from Borneo, and had not encouraged the sympathy\nMrs. Skinner would have been so willing to show her. She seemed\nunwilling to speak of her great loss. Sorrow took people in different\nways. Her husband had said the best thing was to leave her alone. The\nthought of him turned her ideas to the party they were going to.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Father asked if I thought he ought to wear a top-hat,\" she said. \"I\nsaid I thought it was just as well to be on the safe side.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was going to be quite a grand affair. They were having ices,\nstrawberry and vanilla, from Boddy, the confectioner, but the Heywoods\nwere making the iced coffee at home. Everyone would be there. They had\nbeen asked to meet the Bishop of Hong Kong, who was staying with the\nCanon, an old college friend of his, and he was going to speak on the\nChinese missions. Mrs. Skinner, whose daughter had lived in the East for\neight years and whose son-in-law had been Resident of a district in\nBorneo, was in a flutter of interest. Naturally it meant more to her\nthan to people who had never had anything to do with the Colonies and\nthat sort of thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What can they know of England who only England know?\" as Mr. Skinner\nsaid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe came into the room at that moment. He was a lawyer, as his father had\nbeen before him, and he had offices in Lincoln's Inn Fields. He went up\nto London every morning and came down every evening. He was only able to\naccompany his wife and daughters to the Canon's garden-party because the\nCanon had very wisely chosen a Saturday to have it on. Mr. Skinner\nlooked very well in his tail-coat and pepper-and-salt trousers. He was\nnot exactly dressy, but he was neat. He looked like a respectable family\nsolicitor, which indeed he was; his firm never touched work that was not\nperfectly above board, and if a client went to him with some trouble\nthat was not quite nice, Mr. Skinner would look grave.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think this is the sort of case that we very much care to\nundertake,\" he said. \"I think you'd do better to go elsewhere.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe drew towards him his writing-block and scribbled a name and address\non it. He tore off a sheet of paper and handed it to his client.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If I were you I think I would go and see these people. If you mention\nmy name I believe they'll do anything they can for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Skinner was clean-shaven and very bald. His pale lips were tight and\nthin, but his blue eyes were shy. He had no colour in his cheeks and his\nface was much lined.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see you've put on your new trousers,\" said Mrs. Skinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought it would be a good opportunity,\" he answered, \"I was\nwondering if I should wear a buttonhole.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't, father,\" said Kathleen. \"I don't think it's awfully good\nform.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A lot of people will be wearing them,\" said Mrs. Skinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Only clerks and people like that,\" said Kathleen. \"The Heywoods have\nhad to ask everybody, you know. And besides, we are in mourning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder if there'll be a collection after the Bishop's address,\" said\nMr. Skinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should hardly think so,\" said Mrs. Skinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think it would be rather bad form,\" agreed Kathleen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's as well to be on the safe side,\" said Mr. Skinner. \"I'll give for\nall of us. I was wondering if ten shillings would be enough or if I must\ngive a pound.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you give anything I think you ought to give a pound, father,\" said\nKathleen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll see when the time comes. I don't want to give less than anyone\nelse, but on the other hand I see no reason to give more than I need.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKathleen put away her papers in the drawer of the writing-table and\nstood up. She looked at her wrist-watch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is Millicent ready?\" asked Mrs. Skinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's plenty of time. We're only asked at four, and I don't think we\nought to arrive much before half-past. I told Davis to bring the car\nround at four-fifteen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGenerally Kathleen drove the car, but on grand occasions like this\nDavis, who was the gardener, put on his uniform and acted as chauffeur.\nIt looked better when you drove up, and naturally Kathleen didn't much\nwant to drive herself when she was wearing her new jumper. The sight of\nher mother forcing her fingers one by one into her new gloves reminded\nher that she must put on her own. She smelt them to see if any odour of\nthe cleaning still clung to them. It was very slight. She didn't believe\nanyone would notice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last the door opened and Millicent came in. She wore her widow's\nweeds. Mrs. Skinner never could get used to them, but of course she knew\nthat Millicent must wear them for a year. It was a pity they didn't suit\nher; they suited some people. She had tried on Millicent's bonnet once,\nwith its white band and long veil, and thought she looked very well in\nit. Of course she hoped dear Alfred would survive her, but if he didn't\nshe would never go out of weeds. Queen Victoria never had. It was\ndifferent for Millicent; Millicent was a much younger woman; she was\nonly thirty-six; it was very sad to be a widow at thirty-six. And there\nwasn't much chance of her marrying again. Kathleen wasn't very likely to\nmarry now, she was thirty-five; last time Millicent and Harold had come\nhome she had suggested that they should have Kathleen to stay with them;\nHarold had seemed willing enough, but Millicent said it wouldn't do.\nMrs. Skinner didn't know why not. It would give her a chance. Of course\nthey didn't want to get rid of her, but a girl ought to marry, and\nsomehow all the men they knew at home were married already. Millicent\nsaid the climate was trying. It was true she was a bad colour. No one\nwould think now that Millicent had been the prettier of the two.\nKathleen had fined down as she grew older, of course some people said\nshe was too thin, but now that she had cut her hair, with her cheeks red\nfrom playing golf in all weathers, Mrs. Skinner thought her quite\npretty. No one could say that of poor Millicent; she had lost her figure\ncompletely; she had never been tall, and now that she had filled out she\nlooked stocky. She was a good deal too fat; Mrs. Skinner supposed it was\ndue to the tropical heat that prevented her from taking exercise. Her\nskin was sallow and muddy; and her blue eyes, which had been her best\nfeature, had gone quite pale.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She ought to do something about her neck,\" Mrs. Skinner reflected.\n\"She's becoming dreadfully jowly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe had spoken of it once or twice to her husband. He remarked that\nMillicent wasn't as young as she was; that might be, but she needn't let\nherself go altogether. Mrs. Skinner made up her mind to talk to her\ndaughter seriously, but of course she must respect her grief, and she\nwould wait till the year was up. She was just as glad to have this\nreason to put off a conversation the thought of which made her slightly\nnervous. For Millicent was certainly changed. There was something sullen\nin her face which made her mother not quite at home with her. Mrs.\nSkinner liked to say aloud all the thoughts that passed through her\nhead, but Millicent when you made a remark (just to say something, you\nknow) had an awkward habit of not answering, so that you wondered\nwhether she had heard. Sometimes Mrs. Skinner found it so irritating,\nthat not to be quite sharp with Millicent she had to remind herself that\npoor Harold had only been dead eight months.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe light from the window fell on the widow's heavy face as she advanced\nsilently, but Kathleen stood with her back to it. She watched her sister\nfor a moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Millicent, there's something I want to say to you,\" she said. \"I was\nplaying golf with Gladys Heywood this morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you beat her?\" asked Millicent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGladys Heywood was the Canon's only unmarried daughter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She told me something about you which I think you ought to know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent's eyes passed beyond her sister to the little girl watering\nflowers in the garden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you told Annie to give Joan her tea in the kitchen, mother?\" she\nsaid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, she'll have it when the servants have theirs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKathleen looked at her sister coolly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Bishop spent two or three days at Singapore on his way home,\" she\nwent on. \"He's very fond of travelling. He's been to Borneo, and he\nknows a good many of the people that you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He'll be interested to see you, dear,\" said Mrs. Skinner. \"Did he know\npoor Harold?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, he met him at Kuala Solor. He remembers him very well. He says he\nwas shocked to hear of his death.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent sat down and began to put on her black gloves. It seemed\nstrange to Mrs. Skinner that she received these remarks with complete\nsilence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Millicent,\" she said, \"Harold's photo has disappeared. Have you\ntaken it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I put it away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have thought you'd like to have it out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOnce more Millicent said nothing. It really was an exasperating habit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKathleen turned slightly in order to face her sister.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Millicent, why did you tell us that Harold died of fever?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe widow made no gesture, she looked at Kathleen with steady eyes, but\nher sallow skin darkened with a flush. She did not reply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What <i>do</i> you mean, Kathleen?\" asked Mr. Skinner, with surprise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Bishop says that Harold committed suicide.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Skinner gave a startled cry, but her husband put out a deprecating\nhand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it true, Millicent?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But why didn't you tell us?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent paused for an instant. She fingered idly a piece of Brunei\nbrass which stood on the table by her side. That too had been a present\nfrom Harold.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought it better for Joan that her father should be thought to have\ndied of fever. I didn't want her to know anything about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've put us in an awfully awkward position,\" said Kathleen, frowning\na little. \"Gladys Heywood said she thought it rather nasty of me not to\nhave told her the truth. I had the greatest difficulty in getting her to\nbelieve that I knew absolutely nothing about it. She said her father was\nrather put out. He says, after all the years we've known one another,\nand considering that he married you, and the terms we've been on, and\nall that, he does think we might have had confidence in him. And at all\nevents, if we didn't want to tell him the truth we needn't have told him\na lie.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must say I sympathise with him there,\" said Mr. Skinner, acidly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I told Gladys that we weren't to blame. We only told them\nwhat you told us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope it didn't put you off your game,\" said Millicent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Really, my dear, I think that is a most improper observation,\"\nexclaimed her father.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe rose from his chair, walked over to the empty fireplace, and from\nforce of habit stood in front of it with parted coat-tails.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was my business,\" said Millicent, \"and if I chose to keep it to\nmyself I didn't see why I shouldn't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It doesn't look as if you had any affection for your mother if you\ndidn't even tell her,\" said Mrs. Skinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent shrugged her shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You might have known it was bound to come out,\" said Kathleen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why? I didn't expect that two gossiping old parsons would have nothing\nelse to talk about than me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When the Bishop said he'd been to Borneo it's only natural that the\nHeywoods should ask him if he knew you and Harold.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All that's neither here nor there,\" said Mr. Skinner. \"I think you\nshould certainly have told us the truth, and we could have decided what\nwas the best thing to do. As a solicitor I can tell you that in the long\nrun it only makes things worse if you attempt to hide them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor Harold,\" said Mrs. Skinner, and the tears began to trickle down\nher raddled cheeks. \"It seems dreadful. He was always a good son-in-law\nto me. Whatever induced him to do such a dreadful thing?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The climate.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think you'd better give us all the facts, Millicent,\" said her\nfather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Kathleen will tell you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKathleen hesitated. What she had to say really was rather dreadful. It\nseemed terrible that such things should happen to a family like theirs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Bishop says he cut his throat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Skinner gasped and she went impulsively up to her bereaved\ndaughter. She wanted to fold her in her arms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My poor child,\" she sobbed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Millicent withdrew herself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Please don't fuss me, mother. I really can't stand being mauled about.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Really, Millicent,\" said Mr. Skinner, with a frown.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not think she was behaving very nicely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Skinner dabbed her eyes carefully with her handkerchief and with a\nsigh and a little shake of the head returned to her chair. Kathleen\nfidgeted with the long chain she wore round her neck.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It does seem rather absurd that I should have to be told the details of\nmy brother-in-law's death by a friend. It makes us all look such fools.\nThe Bishop wants very much to see you, Millicent; he wants to tell you\nhow much he feels for you.\" She paused, but Millicent did not speak. \"He\nsays that Millicent had been away with Joan and when she came back she\nfound poor Harold lying dead on his bed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must have been a great shock,\" said Mr. Skinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Skinner began to cry again, but Kathleen put her hand gently on her\nshoulder.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't cry, mother,\" she said. \"It'll make your eyes red and people will\nthink it so funny.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were all silent while Mrs. Skinner, drying her eyes, made a\nsuccessful effort to control herself. It seemed very strange to her that\nat this very moment she should be wearing in her toque the egrets that\npoor Harold had given her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's something else I ought to tell you,\" said Kathleen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent looked at her sister again, without haste, and her eyes were\nsteady, but watchful. She had the look of a person who is waiting for a\nsound which he is afraid of missing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want to say anything to wound you, dear,\" Kathleen went on,\n\"but there's something else and I think you ought to know it. The Bishop\nsays that Harold drank.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my dear, how dreadful!\" cried Mrs. Skinner. \"What a shocking thing\nto say. Did Gladys Heywood tell you? What did you say?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I said it was entirely untrue.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is what comes of making secrets of things,\" said Mr. Skinner,\nirritably. \"It's always the same. If you try and hush a thing up all\nsorts of rumours get about which are ten times worse than the truth.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They told the Bishop in Singapore that Harold had killed himself while\nhe was suffering from delirium tremens. I think for all our sakes you\nought to deny that, Millicent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's such a dreadful thing to have said about anyone who's dead,\" said\nMrs. Skinner. \"And it'll be so bad for Joan when she grows up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what is the foundation of this story, Millicent?\" asked her father.\n\"Harold was always very abstemious.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Here,\" said the widow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did he drink?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Like a fish.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe answer was so unexpected, and the tone so sardonic, that all three\nof them were startled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Millicent, how can you talk like that of your husband when he's dead?\"\ncried her mother, clasping her neatly gloved hands. \"I can't understand\nyou. You've been so strange since you came back. I could never have\nbelieved that a girl of mine could take her husband's death like that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never mind about that, mother,\" said Mr. Skinner. \"We can go into all\nthat later.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe walked to the window and looked out at the sunny little garden, and\nthen walked back into the room. He took his pince-nez out of his pocket\nand, though he had no intention of putting them on, wiped them with his\nhandkerchief. Millicent looked at him and in her eyes, unmistakably, was\na look of irony which was quite cynical. Mr. Skinner was vexed. He had\nfinished his week's work and he was a free man till Monday morning.\nThough he had told his wife that this garden-party was a great nuisance\nand he would much sooner have tea quietly in his own garden, he had been\nlooking forward to it. He did not care very much about Chinese missions,\nbut it would be interesting to meet the Bishop. And now this! It was not\nthe kind of thing he cared to be mixed up in; it was most unpleasant to\nbe told on a sudden that his son-in-law was a drunkard and a suicide.\nMillicent was thoughtfully smoothing her white cuffs. Her coolness\nirritated him; but instead of addressing her he spoke to his younger\ndaughter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why don't you sit down, Kathleen? Surely there are plenty of chairs in\nthe room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKathleen drew forward a chair and without a word seated herself. Mr.\nSkinner stopped in front of Millicent and faced her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I see why you told us Harold had died of fever. I think it\nwas a mistake, because that sort of thing is bound to come out sooner or\nlater. I don't know how far what the Bishop has told the Heywoods\ncoincides with the facts, but if you will take my advice you will tell\nus everything as circumstantially as you can, then we can see. We can't\nhope that it will go no further now that Canon Heywood and Gladys know.\nIn a place like this people are bound to talk. It will make it easier\nfor all of us if we at all events know the exact truth.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Skinner and Kathleen thought he put the matter very well. They\nwaited for Millicent's reply. She had listened with an impassive face;\nthat sudden flush had disappeared and it was once more, as usual, pasty\nand sallow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think you'll much like the truth if I tell it you,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must know that you can count on our sympathy and understanding,\"\nsaid Kathleen gravely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent gave her a glance and the shadow of a smile flickered across\nher set mouth. She looked slowly at the three of them. Mrs. Skinner had\nan uneasy impression that she looked at them as though they were\nmannequins at a dressmaker's. She seemed to live in a different world\nfrom theirs and to have no connection with them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, I wasn't in love with Harold when I married him,\" she said\nreflectively.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Skinner was on the point of making an exclamation when a rapid\ngesture of her husband, barely indicated, but after so many years of\nmarried life perfectly significant, stopped her. Millicent went on. She\nspoke with a level voice, slowly, and there was little change of\nexpression in her tone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was twenty-seven, and no one else seemed to want to marry me. It's\ntrue he was forty-four, and it seemed rather old, but he had a very good\nposition, hadn't he? I wasn't likely to get a better chance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Skinner felt inclined to cry again, but she remembered the party.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I see now why you took his photograph away,\" she said\ndolefully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't, mother,\" exclaimed Kathleen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt had been taken when he was engaged to Millicent and was a very good\nphotograph of Harold. Mrs. Skinner had always thought him quite a fine\nman. He was heavily built, tall and perhaps a little too fat, but he\nheld himself well, and his presence was imposing. He was inclined to be\nbald, even then, but men did go bald very early nowadays, and he said\nthat topees, sun-helmets, you know, were very bad for the hair. He had a\nsmall dark moustache, and his face was deeply burned by the sun. Of\ncourse his best feature was his eyes; they were brown and large, like\nJoan's. His conversation was interesting. Kathleen said he was pompous,\nbut Mrs. Skinner didn't think him so, she didn't mind it if a man laid\ndown the law; and when she saw, as she very soon did, that he was\nattracted by Millicent she began to like him very much. He was always\nvery attentive to Mrs. Skinner, and she listened as though she were\nreally interested when he spoke of his district, and told her of the big\ngame he had killed. Kathleen said he had a pretty good opinion of\nhimself, but Mrs. Skinner came of a generation which accepted without\nquestion the good opinion that men had of themselves. Millicent saw very\nsoon which way the wind blew, and though she said nothing to her mother,\nher mother knew that if Harold asked her she was going to accept him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHarold was staying with some people who had been thirty years in Borneo\nand they spoke well of the country. There was no reason why a woman\nshouldn't live there comfortably; of course the children had to come\nhome when they were seven; but Mrs. Skinner thought it unnecessary to\ntrouble about that yet. She asked Harold to dine, and she told him they\nwere always in to tea. He seemed to be at a loose end, and when his\nvisit to his old friends was drawing to a close, she told him they would\nbe very much pleased if he would come and spend a fortnight with them.\nIt was towards the end of this that Harold and Millicent became engaged.\nThey had a very pretty wedding, they went to Venice for their honeymoon,\nand then they started for the East. Millicent wrote from various ports\nat which the ship touched. She seemed happy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"People were very nice to me at Kuala Solor,\" she said. Kuala Solor was\nthe chief town of the state of Sembulu. \"We stayed with the Resident and\neveryone asked us to dinner. Once or twice I heard men ask Harold to\nhave a drink, but he refused; he said he had turned over a new leaf now\nhe was a married man. I didn't know why they laughed. Mrs. Gray, the\nResident's wife, told me they were all so glad Harold was married. She\nsaid it was dreadfully lonely for a bachelor on one of the outstations.\nWhen we left Kuala Solor Mrs. Gray said good-bye to me so funnily that I\nwas quite surprised. It was as if she was solemnly putting Harold in my\ncharge.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey listened to her in silence. Kathleen never took her eyes off her\nsister's impassive face; but Mr. Skinner stared straight in front of him\nat the Malay arms, krises and parangs, which hung on the wall above the\nsofa on which his wife sat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It wasn't till I went back to Kuala Solor a year and a half later, that\nI found out why their manner had seemed so odd.\" Millicent gave a queer\nlittle sound like the echo of a scornful laugh. \"I knew then a good deal\nthat I hadn't known before. Harold came to England that time in order to\nmarry. He didn't much mind who it was. Do you remember how we spread\nourselves out to catch him, mother? We needn't have taken so much\ntrouble.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what you mean, Millicent,\" said Mrs. Skinner, not without\nacerbity, for the insinuation of scheming did not please her. \"I saw he\nwas attracted by you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent shrugged her heavy shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was a confirmed drunkard. He used to go to bed every night with a\nbottle of whisky and empty it before morning. The Chief Secretary told\nhim he'd have to resign unless he stopped drinking. He said he'd give\nhim one more chance. He could take his leave then and go to England. He\nadvised him to marry so that when he got back he'd have someone to look\nafter him. Harold married me because he wanted a keeper. They took bets\nin Kuala Solor on how long I'd make him stay sober.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But he was in love with you,\" Mrs. Skinner interrupted. \"You don't know\nhow he used to speak to me about you, and at that time you're speaking\nof, when you went to Kuala Solor to have Joan, he wrote me such a\ncharming letter about you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent looked at her mother again and a deep colour dyed her sallow\nskin. Her hands, lying on her lap, began to tremble a little. She\nthought of those first months of her married life. The Government launch\ntook them to the mouth of the river, and they spent the night at the\nbungalow which Harold said jokingly was their seaside residence. Next\nday they went up-stream in a prahu. From the novels she had read she\nexpected the rivers of Borneo to be dark and strangely sinister, but the\nsky was blue, dappled with little white clouds, and the green of the\nmangroves and the nipahs, washed by the flowing water, glistened in the\nsun. On each side stretched the pathless jungle, and in the distance,\nsilhouetted against the sky, was the rugged outline of a mountain. The\nair in the early morning was fresh and buoyant. She seemed to enter upon\na friendly, fertile land, and she had a sense of spacious freedom. They\nwatched the banks for monkeys sitting on the branches of the tangled\ntrees, and once Harold pointed out something that looked like a log and\nsaid it was a crocodile. The Assistant Resident, in ducks and a topee,\nwas at the landing-stage to meet them, and a dozen trim little soldiers\nwere lined up to do them honour. The Assistant Resident was introduced\nto her. His name was Simpson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By Jove, sir,\" he said to Harold, \"I'm glad to see you back. It's been\ndeuced lonely without you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Resident's bungalow, surrounded by a garden in which grew wildly all\nmanner of gay flowers, stood on the top of a low hill. It was a trifle\nshabby and the furniture was sparse, but the rooms were cool and of\ngenerous size.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The kampong is down there,\" said Harold, pointing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer eyes followed his gesture, and from among the coconut trees rose the\nbeating of a gong. It gave her a queer little sensation in the heart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThough she had nothing much to do the days passed easily enough. At dawn\na boy brought them their tea and they lounged about the verandah,\nenjoying the fragrance of the morning (Harold in a singlet and a sarong,\nshe in a dressing-gown) till it was time to dress for breakfast. Then\nHarold went to his office and she spent an hour or two learning Malay.\nAfter tiffin he went back to his office while she slept. A cup of tea\nrevived them both, and they went for a walk or played golf on the\nnine-hole links which Harold had made on a level piece of cleared jungle\nbelow the bungalow. Night fell at six and Mr. Simpson came along to have\na drink. They chatted till their late dinner hour, and sometimes Harold\nand Mr. Simpson played chess. The balmy evenings were enchanting. The\nfireflies turned the bushes just below the verandah into\ncoldly-sparkling, tremulous beacons, and flowering trees scented the air\nwith sweet odours. After dinner they read the papers which had left\nLondon six weeks before and presently went to bed. Millicent enjoyed\nbeing a married woman, with a house of her own, and she was pleased with\nthe native servants, in their gay sarongs, who went about the bungalow,\nwith bare feet, silent but friendly. It gave her a pleasant sense of\nimportance to be the wife of the Resident. Harold impressed her by the\nfluency with which he spoke the language, by his air of command, and by\nhis dignity. She went into the court-house now and then to hear him try\ncases. The multifariousness of his duties and the competent way in which\nhe performed them aroused her respect. Mr. Simpson told her that Harold\nunderstood the natives as well as any man in the country. He had the\ncombination of firmness, tact and good-humour which was essential in\ndealing with that timid, revengeful and suspicious race. Millicent began\nto feel a certain admiration for her husband.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey had been married nearly a year when two English naturalists came to\nstay with them for a few days on their way to the interior. They brought\na pressing recommendation from the Governor, and Harold said he wanted\nto do them proud. Their arrival was an agreeable change. Millicent asked\nMr. Simpson to dinner (he lived at the Fort and only dined with them on\nSunday nights) and after dinner the men sat down to play bridge.\nMillicent left them presently and went to bed, but they were so noisy\nthat for some time she could not get to sleep. She did not know at what\nhour she was awakened by Harold staggering into the room. She kept\nsilent. He made up his mind to have a bath before getting into bed; the\nbath-house was just below their room, and he went down the steps that\nled to it. Apparently he slipped, for there was a great clatter, and he\nbegan to swear. Then he was violently sick. She heard him sluice the\nbuckets of water over himself and in a little while, walking very\ncautiously this time, he crawled up the stairs and slipped into bed.\nMillicent pretended to be asleep. She was disgusted. Harold was drunk.\nShe made up her mind to speak about it in the morning. What would the\nnaturalists think of him? But in the morning Harold was so dignified\nthat she hadn't quite the determination to refer to the matter. At eight\nHarold and she, with their two guests, sat down to breakfast. Harold\nlooked round the table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Porridge,\" he said. \"Millicent, your guests might manage a little\nWorcester Sauce for breakfast, but I don't think they'll much fancy\nanything else. Personally I shall content myself with a whisky and\nsoda.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe naturalists laughed, but shamefacedly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your husband's a terror,\" said one of them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should not think I had properly performed the duties of hospitality\nif I sent you sober to bed on the first night of your visit,\" said\nHarold, with his round, stately way of putting things.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent, smiling acidly, was relieved to think that her guests had\nbeen as drunk as her husband. The next evening she sat up with them and\nthe party broke up at a reasonable hour. But she was glad when the\nstrangers went on with their journey. Their life resumed its placid\ncourse. Some months later Harold went on a tour of inspection of his\ndistrict and came back with a bad attack of malaria. This was the first\ntime she had seen the disease of which she had heard so much, and when\nhe recovered it did not seem strange to her that Harold was very shaky.\nShe found his manner peculiar. He would come back from the office and\nstare at her with glazed eyes; he would stand on the verandah, swaying\nslightly, but still dignified, and make long harangues about the\npolitical situation in England; losing the thread of his discourse, he\nwould look at her with an archness which his natural stateliness made\nsomewhat disconcerting and say:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pulls you down dreadfully, this confounded malaria. Ah, little woman,\nyou little know the strain it puts upon a man to be an empire builder.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe thought that Mr. Simpson began to look worried, and once or twice,\nwhen they were alone, he seemed on the point of saying something to her\nwhich his shyness at the last moment prevented. The feeling grew so\nstrong that it made her nervous, and one evening when Harold, she knew\nnot why, had remained later than usual at the office she tackled him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What have you got to say to me, Mr. Simpson?\" she broke out suddenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe blushed and hesitated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing. What makes you think I have anything in particular to say to\nyou?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Simpson was a thin, weedy youth of four and twenty, with a fine head\nof waving hair which he took great pains to plaster down very flat. His\nwrists were swollen and scarred with mosquito bites. Millicent looked at\nhim steadily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If it's something to do with Harold don't you think it would be kinder\nto tell me frankly?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe grew scarlet now. He shuffled uneasily on his rattan chair. She\ninsisted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid you'll think it awful cheek,\" he said at last. \"It's rotten\nof me to say anything about my chief behind his back. Malaria's a rotten\nthing, and after one's had a bout of it one feels awfully down and out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe hesitated again. The corners of his mouth sagged as if he were going\nto cry. To Millicent he seemed like a little boy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll be as silent as the grave,\" she said with a smile, trying to\nconceal her apprehension. \"Do tell me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think it's a pity your husband keeps a bottle of whisky at the\noffice. He's apt to take a nip more often than he otherwise would.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Simpson's voice was hoarse with agitation. Millicent felt a sudden\ncoldness shiver through her. She controlled herself, for she knew that\nshe must not frighten the boy if she were to get out of him all there\nwas to tell. He was unwilling to speak. She pressed him, wheedling,\nappealing to his sense of duty, and at last she began to cry. Then he\ntold her that Harold had been drunk more or less for the last fortnight,\nthe natives were talking about it, and they said that soon he would be\nas bad as he had been before his marriage. He had been in the habit of\ndrinking a good deal too much then, but details of that time,\nnotwithstanding all her attempts, Mr. Simpson resolutely declined to\ngive her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think he's drinking now?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent felt herself on a sudden hot with shame and anger. The Fort,\nas it was called because the rifles and the ammunition were kept there,\nwas also the court-house. It stood opposite the Resident's bungalow in a\ngarden of its own. The sun was just about to set and she did not need a\nhat. She got up and walked across. She found Harold sitting in the\noffice behind the large hall in which he administered justice. There was\na bottle of whisky in front of him. He was smoking cigarettes and\ntalking to three or four Malays who stood in front of him listening with\nobsequious and at the same time scornful smiles. His face was red.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe natives vanished.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I came to see what you were doing,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe rose, for he always treated her with elaborate politeness, and\nlurched. Feeling himself unsteady he assumed an elaborate stateliness of\ndemeanour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Take a seat, my dear, take a seat. I was detained by press of work.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him with angry eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're drunk,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe stared at her, his eyes bulging a little, and a haughty look\ngradually traversed his large and fleshy face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't the remotest idea what you mean,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe had been ready with a flow of wrathful expostulation, but suddenly\nshe burst into tears. She sank into a chair and hid her face. Harold\nlooked at her for an instant, then the tears began to trickle down his\nown cheeks; he came towards her with outstretched arms and fell heavily\non his knees. Sobbing, he clasped her to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Forgive me, forgive me,\" he said. \"I promise you it shall not happen\nagain. It was that damned malaria.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's so humiliating,\" she moaned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe wept like a child. There was something very touching in the\nself-abasement of that big dignified man. Presently Millicent looked up.\nHis eyes, appealing and contrite, sought hers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you give me your word of honour that you'll never touch liquor\nagain?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, yes. I hate it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was then she told him that she was with child. He was overjoyed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is the one thing I wanted. That'll keep me straight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey went back to the bungalow. Harold bathed himself and had a nap.\nAfter dinner they talked long and quietly. He admitted that before he\nmarried her he had occasionally drunk more than was good for him; in\noutstations it was easy to fall into bad habits. He agreed to everything\nthat Millicent asked. And during the months before it was necessary for\nher to go to Kuala Solor for her confinement, Harold was an excellent\nhusband, tender, thoughtful, proud and affectionate; he was\nirreproachable. A launch came to fetch her, she was to leave him for six\nweeks, and he promised faithfully to drink nothing during her absence.\nHe put his hands on her shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never break a promise,\" he said in his dignified way. \"But even\nwithout it, can you imagine that while you are going through so much, I\nshould do anything to increase your troubles?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJoan was born. Millicent stayed at the Resident's and Mrs. Gray, his\nwife, a kindly creature of middle age, was very good to her. The two\nwomen had little to do during the long hours they were alone but to\ntalk, and in course of time Millicent learnt everything there was to\nknow of her husband's alcoholic past. The fact which she found most\ndifficult to reconcile herself to was that Harold had been told that the\nonly condition upon which he would be allowed to keep his post was that\nhe should bring back a wife. It caused in her a dull feeling of\nresentment. And when she discovered what a persistent drunkard he had\nbeen, she felt vaguely uneasy. She had a horrid fear that during her\nabsence he would not have been able to resist the craving. She went home\nwith her baby and a nurse. She spent a night at the mouth of the river\nand sent a messenger in a canoe to announce her arrival. She scanned the\nlanding-stage anxiously as the launch approached it. Harold and Mr.\nSimpson were standing there. The trim little soldiers were lined up. Her\nheart sank, for Harold was swaying slightly, like a man who seeks to\nkeep his balance on a rolling ship, and she knew he was drunk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt wasn't a very pleasant home-coming. She had almost forgotten her\nmother and father and her sister who sat there silently listening to\nher. Now she roused herself and became once more aware of their\npresence. All that she spoke of seemed very far away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I knew that I hated him then,\" she said. \"I could have killed him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Millicent, don't say that,\" cried her mother. \"Don't forget that\nhe's dead, poor man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent looked at her mother, and for a moment a scowl darkened her\nimpassive face. Mr. Skinner moved uneasily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go on,\" said Kathleen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When he found out that I knew all about him he didn't bother very much\nmore. In three months he had another attack of D.Ts.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why didn't you leave him?\" said Kathleen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What would have been the good of that? He would have been dismissed\nfrom the service in a fortnight. Who was to keep me and Joan? I had to\nstay. And when he was sober I had nothing to complain of. He wasn't in\nthe least in love with me, but he was fond of me; I hadn't married him\nbecause I was in love with him, but because I wanted to be married. I\ndid everything I could to keep liquor from him; I managed to get Mr.\nGray to prevent whisky being sent from Kuala Solor, but he got it from\nthe Chinese. I watched him as a cat watches a mouse. He was too cunning\nfor me. In a little while he had another outbreak. He neglected his\nduties. I was afraid complaints would be made. We were two days from\nKuala Solor and that was our safeguard, but I suppose something was\nsaid, for Mr. Gray wrote a private letter of warning to me. I showed it\nto Harold. He stormed and blustered, but I saw he was frightened, and\nfor two or three months he was quite sober. Then he began again. And so\nit went on till our leave became due.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Before we came to stay here I begged and prayed him to be careful. I\ndidn't want any of you to know what sort of a man I had married. All the\ntime he was in England he was all right and before we sailed I warned\nhim. He'd grown to be very fond of Joan, and very proud of her, and she\nwas devoted to him. She always liked him better than she liked me. I\nasked him if he wanted to have his child grow up, knowing that he was a\ndrunkard, and I found out that at last I'd got a hold on him. The\nthought terrified him. I told him that <i>I</i> wouldn't allow it, and if he\never let Joan see him drunk I'd take her away from him at once. Do you\nknow, he grew quite pale when I said it. I fell on my knees that night\nand thanked God, because I'd found a way of saving my husband.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He told me that if I would stand by him, he would have another try. We\nmade up our minds to fight the thing together. And he tried so hard.\nWhen he felt as though he <i>must</i> drink he came to me. You know he was\ninclined to be rather pompous; with me he was so humble, he was like a\nchild; he depended on me. Perhaps he didn't love me when he married me,\nbut he loved me then, me and Joan. I'd hated him, because of the\nhumiliation, because when he was drunk and tried to be dignified and\nimpressive he was loathsome; but now I got a strange feeling in my\nheart. It wasn't love, but it was a queer, shy tenderness. He was\nsomething more than my husband, he was like a child that I'd carried\nunder my heart for long and weary months. He was so proud of me and, you\nknow, I was proud too. His long speeches didn't irritate me any more,\nand I only thought his stately ways rather funny and charming. At last\nwe won. For two years he never touched a drop. He lost his craving\nentirely. He was even able to joke about it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Simpson had left us then and we had another young man called\nFrancis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I'm a reformed drunkard, you know, Francis,' Harold said to him once.\n'If it hadn't been for my wife I'd have been sacked long ago. I've got\nthe best wife in the world, Francis.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't know what it meant to me to hear him say that. I felt that\nall I'd gone through was worth while. I was so happy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was silent. She thought of the broad, yellow and turbid river on\nwhose banks she had lived so long. The egrets, white and gleaming in the\ntremulous sunset, flew down the stream in a flock, flew low and swift,\nand scattered. They were like a ripple of snowy notes, sweet and pure\nand spring-like, which an unseen hand drew forth, a divine arpeggio,\nfrom an unseen harp. They fluttered along between the green banks,\nwrapped in the shadows of evening, like the happy thoughts of a\ncontented mind.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then Joan fell ill. For three weeks we were very anxious. There was no\ndoctor nearer than Kuala Solor and we had to put up with the treatment\nof a native dispenser. When she grew well again I took her down to the\nmouth of the river in order to give her a breath of sea air. We stayed\nthere a week. It was the first time I had been separated from Harold\nsince I went away to have Joan. There was a fishing village, on piles,\nnot far from us, but really we were quite alone. I thought a great deal\nabout Harold, so tenderly, and all at once I knew that I loved him. I\nwas so glad when the prahu came to fetch us back, because I wanted to\ntell him. I thought it would mean a good deal to him. I can't tell you\nhow happy I was. As we rowed up-stream the headman told me that Mr.\nFrancis had had to go up-country to arrest a woman who had murdered her\nhusband. He had been gone a couple of days.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was surprised that Harold was not on the landing-stage to meet me; he\nwas always very punctilious about that sort of thing; he used to say\nthat husband and wife should treat one another as politely as they\ntreated acquaintances; and I could not imagine what business had\nprevented him. I walked up the little hill on which the bungalow stood.\nThe ayah brought Joan behind me. The bungalow was strangely silent.\nThere seemed to be no servants about, and I could not make it out; I\nwondered if Harold hadn't expected me so soon and was out. I went up the\nsteps. Joan was thirsty and the ayah took her to the servants' quarters\nto give her something to drink. Harold was not in the sitting-room. I\ncalled him, but there was no answer. I was disappointed because I should\nhave liked him to be there. I went into our bedroom. Harold wasn't out\nafter all; he was lying on the bed asleep. I was really very much\namused, because he always pretended he never slept in the afternoon. He\nsaid it was an unnecessary habit that we white people got into. I went\nup to the bed softly. I thought I would have a joke with him. I opened\nthe mosquito curtains. He was lying on his back, with nothing on but a\nsarong, and there was an empty whisky bottle by his side. He was drunk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It had begun again. All my struggles for so many years were wasted. My\ndream was shattered. It was all hopeless. I was seized with rage.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent's face grew once again darkly red and she clenched the arms of\nthe chair she sat in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I took him by the shoulders and shook him with all my might. 'You\nbeast,' I cried, 'you beast.' I was so angry I don't know what I did, I\ndon't know what I said. I kept on shaking him. You don't know how\nloathsome he looked, that large fat man, half-naked; he hadn't shaved\nfor days, and his face was bloated and purple. He was breathing heavily.\nI shouted at him, but he took no notice. I tried to drag him out of bed,\nbut he was too heavy. He lay there like a log. 'Open your eyes,' I\nscreamed. I shook him again. I hated him. I hated him all the more\nbecause for a week I'd loved him with all my heart. He'd let me down.\nHe'd let me down. I wanted to tell him what a filthy beast he was. I\ncould make no impression on him. 'You shall open your eyes,' I cried. I\nwas determined to make him look at me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe widow licked her dry lips. Her breath seemed hurried. She was\nsilent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If he was in that state I should have thought it best to have let him\ngo on sleeping,\" said Kathleen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There was a parang on the wall by the side of the bed. You know how\nfond Harold was of curios.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's a parang?\" said Mrs. Skinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be silly, mother,\" her husband replied irritably. \"There's one on\nthe wall immediately behind you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe pointed to the Malay sword on which for some reason his eyes had been\nunconsciously resting. Mrs. Skinner drew quickly into the corner of the\nsofa, with a little frightened gesture, as though she had been told that\na snake lay curled up beside her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Suddenly the blood spurted out from Harold's throat. There was a great\nred gash right across it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Millicent,\" cried Kathleen, springing up and almost leaping towards\nher, \"what in God's name do you mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Skinner stood staring at her with wide startled eyes, her mouth\nopen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The parang wasn't on the wall any more. It was on the bed. Then Harold\nopened his eyes. They were just like Joan's.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't understand,\" said Mr. Skinner. \"How could he have committed\nsuicide if he was in the state you describe?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKathleen took her sister's arm and shook her angrily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Millicent, for God's sake explain.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent released herself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The parang was on the wall, I told you, I don't know what happened.\nThere was all the blood, and Harold opened his eyes. He died almost at\nonce. He never spoke, but he gave a sort of gasp.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last Mr. Skinner found his voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But, you wretched woman, it was murder.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent, her face mottled with red, gave him such a look of scornful\nhatred that he shrank back. Mrs. Skinner cried out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Millicent, you didn't do it, did you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen Millicent did something that made them all feel as though their\nblood were turned to ice in their veins. She chuckled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know who else did,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My God,\" muttered Mr. Skinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKathleen had been standing bolt upright with her hands to her heart, as\nthough its beating were intolerable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what happened then?\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I screamed. I went to the window and flung it open. I called for the\nayah. She came across the compound with Joan. 'Not Joan,' I cried.\n'Don't let her come.' She called the cook and told him to take the\nchild. I cried to her to hurry. And when she came I showed her Harold.\n'The Tuan's killed himself!' I cried. She gave a scream and ran out of\nthe house.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No one would come near. They were all frightened out of their wits. I\nwrote a letter to Mr. Francis, telling him what had happened and asking\nhim to come at once.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How do you mean you told him what had happened?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I said, on my return from the mouth of the river, I'd found Harold with\nhis throat cut. You know, in the tropics you have to bury people\nquickly. I got a Chinese coffin, and the soldiers dug a grave behind the\nFort. When Mr. Francis came, Harold had been buried for nearly two days.\nHe was only a boy. I could do anything I wanted with him. I told him I'd\nfound the parang in Harold's hand and there was no doubt he'd killed\nhimself in an attack of delirium tremens. I showed him the empty bottle.\nThe servants said he'd been drinking hard ever since I left to go to the\nsea. I told the same story at Kuala Solor. Everyone was very kind to me,\nand the Government granted me a pension.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a little while nobody spoke. At last Mr. Skinner gathered himself\ntogether.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am a member of the legal profession. I'm a solicitor. I have certain\nduties. We've always had a most respectable practice. You've put me in a\nmonstrous position.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe fumbled, searching for the phrases that played at hide and seek in\nhis scattered wits. Millicent looked at him with scorn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do about it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was murder, that's what it was; do you think I can possibly connive\nat it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't talk nonsense, father,\" said Kathleen sharply. \"You can't give up\nyour own daughter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've put me in a monstrous position,\" he repeated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent shrugged her shoulders again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You made me tell you. And I've borne it long enough by myself. It was\ntime that all of you bore it too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment the door was opened by the maid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Davis has brought the car round, sir,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKathleen had the presence of mind to say something, and the maid\nwithdrew.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'd better be starting,\" said Millicent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't go to the party now,\" cried Mrs. Skinner, with horror. \"I'm far\ntoo upset. How can we face the Heywoods? And the Bishop will want to be\nintroduced to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMillicent made a gesture of indifference. Her eyes held their ironical\nexpression.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We must go, mother,\" said Kathleen. \"It would look so funny if we\nstayed away.\" She turned on Millicent furiously. \"Oh, I think the whole\nthing is such frightfully bad form.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Skinner looked helplessly at her husband. He went to her and gave\nher his hand to help her up from the sofa.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid we must go, mother,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And me with the egrets in my toque that Harold gave me with his own\nhands.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe led her out of the room, Kathleen followed close on their heels, and\na step or two behind came Millicent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll get used to it, you know,\" she said quietly. \"At first I thought\nof it all the time, but now I forget it for two or three days together.\nIt's not as if there was any danger.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey did not answer. They walked through the hall and out of the front\ndoor. The three ladies got into the back of the car and Mr. Skinner\nseated himself beside the driver. They had no self-starter; it was an\nold car, and Davis went to the bonnet to crank it up. Mr. Skinner turned\nround and looked petulantly at Millicent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I ought never to have been told,\" he said. \"I think it was most selfish\nof you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDavis took his seat and they drove off to the Canon's garden-party.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThere are few books in the world that contain more meat than the\n\"Sailing Directions\" published by the Hydrographic Department by order\nof the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. They are handsome volumes,\nbound (very flimsily) in cloth of different colours, and the most\nexpensive of them is cheap. For four shillings you can buy the \"Yangtse\nKiang Pilot\", 'containing a description of, and sailing directions for,\nthe Yangtse Kiang from the Wusung river to the highest navigable point,\nincluding the Han Kiang, the Kialing Kiang, and the Min Kiang'; and for\nthree shillings you can get Part III of the \"Eastern Archipelago Pilot\",\n'comprising the N.E. end of Celebes, Molucca and Gilolo passages, Banda\nand Arafura Seas, and North, West, and South-West coasts of New Guinea.'\nBut it is not very safe to do so if you are a creature of settled habits\nthat you have no wish to disturb or if you have an occupation that holds\nyou fast to one place. These business-like books take you upon enchanted\njourneys of the spirit; and their matter-of-fact style, the admirable\norder, the concision with which the material is set before you, the\nstern sense of the practical that informs every line, cannot dim the\npoetry that, like the spice-laden breeze that assails your senses with a\nmore than material languor when you approach some of those magic islands\nof the Eastern seas, blows with so sweet a fragrance through the printed\npages. They tell you the anchorages and the landing places, what\nsupplies you can get at each spot, and where you can get water; they\ntell you the lights and buoys, tides, winds and weather that you will\nfind there. They give you brief information about the population and the\ntrade. And it is strange when you think how sedately it is all set down,\nwith no words wasted, that so much else is given you besides. What?\nWell, mystery and beauty, romance and the glamour of the unknown. It is\nno common book that offers you casually turning its pages such a\nparagraph as this: 'Supplies. A few jungle fowl are preserved, the\nisland is also the resort of vast numbers of sea birds. Turtle are found\nin the lagoon, as well as quantities of various fish, including grey\nmullet, shark, and dog-fish; the seine cannot be used with any effect;\nbut there is a fish which may be taken on a rod. A small store of tinned\nprovisions and spirits is kept in a hut for the relief of shipwrecked\npersons. Good water may be obtained from a well near the landing-place'.\nCan the imagination want more material than this to go on a journey\nthrough time and space?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the volume from which I have copied this passage, the compilers with\nthe same restraint have described the Alas Islands. They are composed of\na group or chain of islands, 'for the most part low and wooded,\nextending about 75 miles east and west, and 40 miles north and south'.\nThe information about them, you are told, is very slight; there are\nchannels between the different groups, and several vessels have passed\nthrough them, but the passages have not been thoroughly explored, and\nthe positions of many of the dangers not yet determined; it is therefore\nadvisable to avoid them. The population of the group is estimated at\nabout 8000, of whom 200 are Chinese and 400 Mohammedans. The rest are\nheathen. The principal island is called Baru, it is surrounded by a\nreef, and here lives a Dutch Contrôleur. His white house with its red\nroof on the top of a little hill is the most prominent object that the\nvessels of the Royal Netherlands Steam Packet Company see when every\nother month on their way up to Macassar and every four weeks on their\nway down to Merauke in Dutch New Guinea they touch at the island.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt a certain moment of the world's history the Contrôleur was Mynheer\nEvert Gruyter and he ruled the people who inhabited the Alas Islands\nwith firmness tempered by a keen sense of the ridiculous. He had thought\nit a very good joke to be placed at the age of twenty-seven in a\nposition of such consequence and at thirty he was still amused by it.\nThere was no cable communication between his islands and Batavia, and\nthe mail arrived after so long a delay that even if he asked advice, by\nthe time he received it, it was useless, and so he equably did what he\nthought best and trusted to his good fortune to keep out of trouble with\nthe authorities. He was very short, not more than five feet four in\nheight, and extremely fat; he was of a florid complexion. For coolness'\nsake he kept his head shaved and his face was hairless. It was round and\nred. His eyebrows were so fair that you hardly saw them; and he had\nlittle twinkling blue eyes. He knew that he had no dignity, but for the\nsake of his position made up for it by dressing very dapperly. He never\nwent to his office, nor sat in court, nor walked abroad but in spotless\nwhite. His stengah-shifter, with its bright brass buttons, fitted him\nvery tightly and displayed the shocking fact that, young though he was,\nhe had a round and protruding belly. His good-humoured face shone with\nsweat and he constantly fanned himself with a palm-leaf fan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut in his house Mr. Gruyter preferred to wear nothing but a sarong and\nthen with his white podgy little body he looked like a fat funny boy of\nsixteen. He was an early riser and his breakfast was always ready for\nhim at six. It never varied. It consisted of a slice of papaia, three\ncold fried eggs, Edam cheese, sliced thin, and a cup of black coffee.\nWhen he had eaten it, he smoked a large Dutch cigar, read the papers if\nhe had not read them through and through already, and then dressed to go\ndown to his office.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne morning while he was thus occupied his head boy came into his\nbedroom and told him that Tuan Jones wanted to know if he could see him.\nMr. Gruyter was standing in front of a looking-glass. He had his\ntrousers on and was admiring his smooth chest. He arched his back in\norder to throw it out and throw in his belly and with a good deal of\nsatisfaction gave his breast three or four resounding slaps. It was a\nmanly chest. When the boy brought the message he looked at his own eyes\nin the mirror and exchanged a slightly ironic smile with them. He asked\nhimself what the devil his visitor could want. Evert Gruyter spoke\nEnglish, Dutch and Malay with equal facility, but he thought in Dutch.\nHe liked to do this. It seemed to him a pleasantly ribald language.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ask the tuan to wait and say I shall come directly.\" He put on his\ntunic, over his naked body, buttoned it up, and strutted into the\nsitting-room. The Rev. Owen Jones got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-morning, Mr. Jones,\" said the Contrôleur. \"Have you come in to\nhave a peg with me before I start my day's work?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Jones did not smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've come to see you upon a very distressing matter, Mr. Gruyter,\" he\nanswered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur was not disconcerted by his visitor's gravity nor\ndepressed by his words. His little blue eyes beamed amiably.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sit down, my dear fellow, and have a cigar.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Gruyter knew quite well that the Rev. Owen Jones neither drank nor\nsmoked, but it tickled something prankish in his nature to offer him a\ndrink and a smoke whenever they met. Mr. Jones shook his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Jones was in charge of the Baptist Mission on the Alas Islands. His\nheadquarters were at Baru, the largest of them, with the greatest\npopulation, but he had meeting-houses under the care of native helpers\nin several other islands of the group. He was a tall, thin melancholy\nman, with a long face, sallow and drawn, of about forty. His brown hair\nwas already white on the temples and it receded from the forehead. This\ngave him a look of somewhat vacuous intellectuality. Mr. Gruyter both\ndisliked and respected him. He disliked him because he was narrow-minded\nand dogmatic. Himself a cheerful pagan who liked the good things of the\nflesh and was determined to get as many of them as his circumstances\npermitted, he had no patience with a man who disapproved of them all. He\nthought the customs of the country suited its inhabitants and had no\npatience with the missionary's energetic efforts to destroy a way of\nlife that for centuries had worked very well. He respected him because\nhe was honest, zealous and good. Mr. Jones, an Australian of Welsh\ndescent, was the only qualified doctor in the group and it was a comfort\nto know that if you fell ill you need not rely only on a Chinese\npractitioner, and none knew better than the Contrôleur how useful to all\nMr. Jones's skill had been and with what charity he had given it. On the\noccasion of an epidemic of influenza the missionary had done the work of\nten men and no storm short of a typhoon could prevent him from crossing\nto one island or another if his help was needed. He lived with his\nsister in a little white house about half a mile from the village and\nwhen the Contrôleur had arrived, came on board to meet him and begged\nhim to stay till he could get his own house in order. The Contrôleur had\naccepted and soon saw for himself with what simplicity the couple lived.\nIt was more than he could stand. Tea at three sparse meals a day and\nwhen he lit his cigar Mr. Jones politely but firmly asked him to be good\nenough not to smoke, since both his sister and he strongly disapproved\nof it. In twenty-four hours Mr. Gruyter moved into his own house. He\nfled, with panic in his heart, as though from a plague-stricken city.\nThe Contrôleur was fond of a joke and he liked to laugh; to be with a\nman who took your nonsense in deadly earnest and never even smiled at\nyour best story was more than flesh and blood could stand. The Rev. Owen\nJones was a worthy man, but as a companion he was impossible. His sister\nwas worse. Neither had a sense of humour, but whereas the missionary was\nof a melancholy turn, doing his duty so conscientiously, with the\nobvious conviction that everything in the world was hopeless, Miss Jones\nwas resolutely cheerful. She grimly looked on the bright side of things.\nWith the ferocity of an avenging angel she sought out the good in her\nfellow-men. Miss Jones taught in the mission school and helped her\nbrother in his medical work. When he did operations she gave the\nanæsthetic and was matron, dresser and nurse of the tiny hospital which\non his own initiative Mr. Jones had added to the mission. But the\nContrôleur was an obstinate little fellow and he never lost his capacity\nof extracting amusement from the Rev. Owen's dour struggle with the\ninfirmities of human nature, and Miss Jones's ruthless optimism. He had\nto get his fun where he could. The Dutch boats came in three times in\ntwo months for a few hours and then he could have a good old crack with\nthe captain and chief engineer, and once in a blue moon a pearling\nlugger came in from Thursday Island or Port Darwin and for two or three\ndays he had a grand time. They were rough fellows, the pearlers, for the\nmost part, but they were full of guts, and they had plenty of liquor on\nboard, and good stories to tell, and the Contrôleur had them up to his\nhouse and gave them a fine dinner and the party was only counted a\nsuccess if they were all too drunk to get back on the lugger again that\nnight. But beside the missionary the only white man who lived on Baru\nwas Ginger Ted, and he, of course, was a disgrace to civilisation. There\nwas not a single thing to be said in his favour. He cast discredit on\nthe white race. All the same, but for Ginger Ted the Contrôleur\nsometimes thought he would find life on the island of Baru almost more\nthan he could bear.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOddly enough it was on account of this scamp that Mr. Jones, when he\nshould have been instructing the pagan young in the mysteries of the\nBaptist faith, was paying Mr. Gruyter this early visit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sit down, Mr. Jones,\" said the Contrôleur. \"What can I do for you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I've come to see you about the man they call Ginger Ted. What are\nyou going to do now?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, what's happened?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Haven't you heard? I thought the sergeant would have told you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't encourage the members of my staff to come to my private house\nunless the matter is urgent,\" said the Contrôleur rather grandly. \"I am\nunlike you, Mr. Jones, I only work in order to have leisure and I like\nto enjoy my leisure without disturbance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Mr. Jones did not care much for small-talk and he was not interested\nin general reflections.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There was a disgraceful row in one of the Chinese shops last night.\nGinger Ted wrecked the place and half killed a Chinaman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Drunk again, I suppose,\" said the Contrôleur placidly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Naturally. When is he anything else? They sent for the police and he\nassaulted the sergeant. They had to have six men to get him to the\njail.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's a hefty fellow,\" said the Contrôleur.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you'll send him to Macassar.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEvert Gruyter returned the missionary's outraged look with a merry\ntwinkle. He was no fool and he knew already what Mr. Jones was up to. It\ngave him considerable amusement to tease him a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fortunately my powers are wide enough to enable me to deal with the\nsituation myself,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You have power to deport anyone you like, Mr. Gruyter, and I'm sure it\nwould save a lot of trouble if you got rid of the man altogether.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have the power of course, but I am sure you would be the last person\nto wish me to use it arbitrarily.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Gruyter, the man's presence here is a public scandal. He's never\nsober from morning till night; it's notorious that he has relations with\none native woman after another.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is an interesting point, Mr. Jones. I had always heard that\nalcoholic excess, though it stimulated sexual desire, prevented its\ngratification. What you tell me about Ginger Ted does not seem to bear\nout this theory.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe missionary flushed a dull red.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"These are physiological matters which at the moment I have no wish to\ngo into,\" he said, frigidly. \"The behaviour of this man does\nincalculable damage to the prestige of the white race, and his example\nseriously hampers the efforts that are made in other quarters to induce\nthe people of these islands to lead a less vicious life. He's an\nout-and-out bad lot.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pardon my asking, but have you made any attempts to reform him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When he first drifted here I did my best to get in touch with him. He\nrepelled all my advances. When there was that first trouble I went to\nhim and talked to him straight from the shoulder. He swore at me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No one has a greater appreciation than I of the excellent work that you\nand other missionaries do on these islands, but are you sure that you\nalways exercise your calling with all the tact possible?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur was rather pleased with this phrase. It was extremely\ncourteous and yet contained a reproof that he thought worth\nadministering. The missionary looked at him gravely. His sad brown eyes\nwere full of sincerity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did Jesus exercise tact when he took a whip and drove the\nmoney-changers from the Temple? No, Mr. Gruyter. Tact is the subterfuge\nthe lax avail themselves of to avoid doing their duty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Jones's remark made the Contrôleur feel suddenly that he wanted a\nbottle of beer. The missionary leaned forward earnestly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Gruyter, you know this man's transgressions just as well as I do.\nIt's unnecessary for me to remind you of them. There are no excuses for\nhim. Now he really has overstepped the limit. You'll never have a better\nchance than this. I beg you to use the power you have and turn him out\nonce for all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur's eyes twinkled more brightly than ever. He was having a\nlot of fun. He reflected that human beings were much more amusing when\nyou did not feel called upon in dealing with them to allot praise or\nblame.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But, Mr. Jones, do I understand you right? Are you asking me to give\nyou an assurance to deport this man before I've heard the evidence\nagainst him and listened to his defence?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what his defence can be.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur rose from his chair and really he managed to get quite a\nlittle dignity into his five feet four inches.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am here to administer justice according to the laws of the Dutch\nGovernment. Permit me to tell you that I am exceedingly surprised that\nyou should attempt to influence me in my judicial functions.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe missionary was a trifle flustered. It had never occurred to him that\nthis little whipper-snapper of a boy, ten years younger than himself,\nwould dream of adopting such an attitude. He opened his mouth to explain\nand apologise, but the Contrôleur raised a podgy little hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is time for me to go to my office, Mr. Jones. I wish you\ngood-morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe missionary, taken aback, bowed and without another word walked out\nof the room. He would have been surprised to see what the Contrôleur did\nwhen his back was turned. A broad grin broke on his lips and he put his\nthumb to his nose and cocked a snook at the Rev. Owen Jones.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA few minutes later he went down to his office. His head clerk, who was\na Dutch half-caste, gave him his version of the previous night's row. It\nagreed pretty well with Mr. Jones's. The court was sitting that day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you take Ginger Ted first, sir?\" asked the clerk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see no reason to do that. There are two or three cases held over from\nthe last sitting. I will take him in his proper order.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought perhaps as he was a white man you would like to see him\nprivately, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The majesty of the law knows no difference between white and coloured,\nmy friend,\" said Mr. Gruyter, somewhat pompously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe court was a big square room with wooden benches on which, crowded\ntogether, sat natives of all kinds, Polynesians, Bugis, Chinese, Malays,\nand they all rose when a door was opened and a sergeant announced the\narrival of the Contrôleur. He entered with his clerk and took his place\non a little dais at a table of varnished pitch pine. Behind him was a\nlarge engraving of Queen Wilhelmina. He despatched half a dozen cases\nand then Ginger Ted was brought in. He stood in the dock, handcuffed,\nwith a warder on either side of him. The Contrôleur looked at him with a\ngrave face, but he could not keep the amusement out of his eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGinger Ted was suffering from a hang-over. He swayed a little as he\nstood and his eyes were vacant. He was a man still young, thirty\nperhaps, of somewhat over the middle height, rather fat, with a bloated\nred face and a shock of curly red hair. He had not come out of the\ntussle unscathed. He had a black eye and his mouth was cut and swollen.\nHe wore khaki shorts, very dirty and ragged, and his singlet had been\nalmost torn off his back. A great rent showed the thick mat of red hair\nwith which his chest was covered, but showed also the astonishing\nwhiteness of his skin. The Contrôleur looked at the charge sheet. He\ncalled the evidence. When he had heard it, when he had seen the Chinaman\nwhose head Ginger Ted had broken with a bottle, when he had heard the\nagitated story of the sergeant who had been knocked flat when he tried\nto arrest him, when he had listened to the tale of the havoc wrought by\nGinger Ted who in his drunken fury had smashed everything he could lay\nhands on, he turned and addressed the accused in English.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Ginger, what have you got to say for yourself?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was blind. I don't remember a thing about it. If they say I half\nkilled 'im I suppose I did. I'll pay the damage if they'll give me time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You will, Ginger,\" said the Contrôleur, \"but it's me who'll give you\ntime.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at Ginger Ted for a minute in silence. He was an unappetising\nobject. A man who had gone completely to pieces. He was horrible. It\nmade you shudder to look at him and if Mr. Jones had not been so\nofficious, at that moment the Contrôleur would certainly have ordered\nhim to be deported.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've been a trouble ever since you came to the islands, Ginger.\nYou're a disgrace. You're incorrigibly idle. You've been picked up in\nthe street dead drunk time and time again. You've kicked up row after\nrow. You're hopeless. I told you the last time you were brought here\nthat if you were arrested again I should deal with you severely. You've\ngone the limit this time and you're for it. I sentence you to six\nmonths' hard labour.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By God, I'll kill you when I come out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe burst into a string of oaths both filthy and blasphemous. Mr. Gruyter\nlistened scornfully. You can swear much better in Dutch than in English\nand there was nothing that Ginger Ted said that he could not have\neffectively capped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Be quiet,\" he ordered. \"You make me tired.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur repeated his sentence in Malay and the prisoner was led\nstruggling away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Gruyter sat down to tiffin in high good-humour. It was astonishing\nhow amusing life could be if you exercised a little ingenuity. There\nwere people in Amsterdam, and even in Batavia and Surabaya, who looked\nupon his island home as a place of exile. They little knew how agreeable\nit was and what fun he could extract from unpromising material. They\nasked him whether he did not miss the club and the races and the cinema,\nthe dances that were held once a week at the Casino and the society of\nDutch ladies. Not at all. He liked comfort. The substantial furniture of\nthe room in which he sat had a satisfying solidity. He liked reading\nFrench novels of a frivolous nature and he appreciated the sensation of\nreading one after the other without the uneasiness occasioned by the\nthought that he was wasting his time. It seemed to him a great luxury to\nwaste time. When his young man's fancy turned to thoughts of love his\nhead boy brought to the house a little dark-skinned bright-eyed creature\nin a sarong. He took care to form no connection of a permanent nature.\nHe thought that change kept the heart young. He enjoyed freedom and was\nnot weighed down by a sense of responsibility. He did not mind the heat.\nIt made a sluice over with cold water half a dozen times a day a\npleasure that had almost an æsthetic quality. He played the piano. He\nwrote letters to his friends in Holland. He felt no need for the\nconversation of intellectual persons. He liked a good laugh, but he\ncould get that out of a fool just as well as out of a professor of\nphilosophy. He had a notion that he was a very wise little man.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLike all good Dutchmen in the Far East he began his lunch with a small\nglass of Hollands gin. It has a musty acrid flavour, and the taste for\nit must be acquired, but Mr. Gruyter preferred it to any cocktail. When\nhe drank it he felt besides that he was upholding the traditions of his\nrace. Then he had <i>rystafel</i>. He had it every day. He heaped a\nsoup-plate high with rice, and then, his three boys waiting on him,\nhelped himself to the curry that one handed him, to the fried egg that\nanother brought, and to the condiment presented by the third. Then each\none brought another dish, of bacon, or bananas, or pickled fish, and\npresently his plate was piled high in a huge pyramid. He stirred it all\ntogether and began to eat. He ate slowly and with relish. He drank a\nbottle of beer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not think while he was eating. His attention was applied to the\nmass in front of him and he consumed it with a happy concentration. It\nnever palled on him. And when he had emptied the great plate it was a\ncompensation to think that next day he would have <i>rystafel</i> again. He\ngrew tired of it as little as the rest of us grow tired of bread. He\nfinished his beer and lit his cigar. The boy brought him a cup of\ncoffee. He leaned back in his chair then and allowed himself the luxury\nof reflection.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt tickled him to have sentenced Ginger Ted to the richly deserved\npunishment of six months' hard labour, and he smiled when he thought of\nhim working on the roads with the other prisoners. It would have been\nsilly to deport from the island the one man with whom he could\noccasionally have a heart-to-heart talk, and besides, the satisfaction\nit would have given the missionary would have been bad for that\ngentleman's character. Ginger Ted was a scamp and a scallywag, but the\nContrôleur had a kindly feeling for him. They had drunk many a bottle of\nbeer in one another's company and when the pearl-fishers from Port\nDarwin came in and they all made a night of it, they had got gloriously\ntight together. The Contrôleur liked the reckless way in which Ginger\nTed squandered the priceless treasure of life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGinger Ted had wandered in one day on the ship that was going up from\nMerauke to Macassar. The captain did not know how he had found his way\nthere, but he had travelled steerage with the natives, and he stopped\noff at the Alas Islands because he liked the look of them. Mr. Gruyter\nhad a suspicion that their attraction consisted perhaps in their being\nunder the Dutch flag and so out of British jurisdiction. But his papers\nwere in order, so there was no reason why he should not stay. He said\nthat he was buying pearl-shell for an Australian firm, but it soon\nappeared that his commercial undertakings were not serious. Drink,\nindeed, took up so much of his time that he had little left over for\nother pursuits. He was in receipt of two pounds a week, paid monthly,\nwhich came regularly to him from England. The Contrôleur guessed that\nthis sum was paid only so long as he kept well away from the persons who\nsent it. It was anyway too small to permit him any liberty of movement.\nGinger Ted was reticent. The Contrôleur discovered that he was an\nEnglishman, this he learnt from his passport, which described him as\nEdward Wilson, and that he had been in Australia. But why he had left\nEngland and what he had done in Australia he had no notion. Nor could he\never quite tell to what class Ginger Ted belonged. When you saw him in a\nfilthy singlet and a pair of ragged trousers, a battered topee on his\nhead, with the pearl-fishers and heard his conversation, coarse, obscene\nand illiterate, you thought he must be a sailor before the mast who had\ndeserted his ship, or a labourer, but when you saw his handwriting you\nwere surprised to find that it was that of a man not without at least\nsome education, and on occasion when you got him alone, if he had had a\nfew drinks but was not yet drunk, he would talk of matters that neither\na sailor nor a labourer would have been likely to know anything about.\nThe Contrôleur had a certain sensitiveness and he realised that Ginger\nTed did not speak to him as an inferior to a superior but as an equal.\nMost of his remittance was mortgaged before he received it, and the\nChinamen to whom he owed money were standing at his elbow when the\nmonthly letter was delivered to him, but with what was left he proceeded\nto get drunk. It was then that he made trouble, for when drunk he grew\nviolent and was then likely to commit acts that brought him into the\nhands of the police. Hitherto Mr. Gruyter had contented himself with\nkeeping him in jail till he was sober and giving him a talking to. When\nhe was out of money he cadged what drink he could from anyone who would\ngive it him. Rum, brandy, arak, it was all the same to him. Two or three\ntimes Mr. Gruyter had got him work on plantations run by Chinese in one\nor other of the islands, but he could not stick to it, and in a few\nweeks was back again at Baru on the beach. It was a miracle how he kept\nbody and soul together. He had, of course, a way with him. He picked up\nthe various dialects spoken on the islands, and knew how to make the\nnatives laugh. They despised him, but they respected his physical\nstrength, and they liked his company. He was as a result never at a loss\nfor a meal or a mat to sleep on. The strange thing was, and it was this\nthat chiefly outraged the Rev. Owen Jones, that he could do anything he\nliked with a woman. The Contrôleur could not imagine what it was they\nsaw in him. He was casual with them and rather brutal. He took what they\ngave him, but seemed incapable of gratitude. He used them for his\npleasure and then flung them indifferently away. Once or twice this had\ngot him into trouble, and Mr. Gruyter had had to sentence an angry\nfather for sticking a knife in Ginger Ted's back one night, and a\nChinese woman had sought to poison herself by swallowing opium because\nhe had deserted her. Once Mr. Jones came to the Contrôleur in a great\nstate because the beachcomber had seduced one of his converts. The\nContrôleur agreed that it was very deplorable, but could only advise Mr.\nJones to keep a sharp eye on these young persons. The Contrôleur liked\nit less when he discovered that a girl whom he fancied a good deal\nhimself and had been seeing for several weeks had all the time been\naccording her favours also to Ginger Ted. When he thought of this\nparticular incident he smiled again at the thought of Ginger Ted doing\nsix months' hard labour. It is seldom in this life that in the process\nof doing your bounden duty you can get back on a fellow who has played\nyou a dirty trick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA few days later Mr. Gruyter was taking a walk, partly for exercise and\npartly to see that some job he wanted done was being duly proceeded\nwith, when he passed a gang of prisoners working under the charge of a\nwarder. Among them he saw Ginger Ted. He wore the prison sarong, a dingy\ntunic called in Malay a <i>baju</i>, and his own battered topi. They were\nrepairing the road, and Ginger Ted was wielding a heavy pick. The way\nwas narrow and the Contrôleur saw that he must pass within a foot of\nhim. He remembered his threats. He knew that Ginger Ted was a man of\nviolent passion and the language he had used in the dock made it plain\nthat he had not seen what a good joke it was of the Contrôleur's to\nsentence him to six months' hard labour. If Ginger Ted suddenly attacked\nhim with the pick, nothing on God's earth could save him. It was true\nthat the warder would immediately shoot him down, but meanwhile the\nContrôleur's head would be bashed in. It was with a funny little feeling\nin the pit of his stomach that Mr. Gruyter walked through the gang of\nprisoners. They were working in pairs a few feet from one another. He\nset his mind on neither hastening his pace nor slackening it. As he\npassed Ginger Ted, the man swung his pick into the ground and looked up\nat the Contrôleur and as he caught his eye winked. The Contrôleur\nchecked the smile that rose to his lips and with official dignity strode\non. But that wink, so lusciously full of sardonic humour, filled him\nwith satisfaction. If he had been the Caliph of Bagdad instead of a\njunior official in the Dutch Civil Service, he would forthwith have\nreleased Ginger Ted, sent slaves to bath and perfume him, and having\nclothed him in a golden robe entertained him to a sumptuous repast.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGinger Ted was an exemplary prisoner and in a month or two the\nContrôleur, having occasion to send a gang to do some work on one of the\noutlying islands, included him in it. There was no jail there, so the\nten fellows he sent, under the charge of a warder, were billeted on the\nnatives and after their day's work lived like free men. The job was\nsufficient to take up the rest of Ginger Ted's sentence. The Contrôleur\nsaw him before he left.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, Ginger,\" he said to him, \"here's ten guilder for you so that\nyou can buy yourself tobacco when you're gone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Couldn't you make it a bit more? There's eight pounds a month coming in\nregularly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think that's enough. I'll keep the letters that come for you, and\nwhen you get back you'll have a tidy sum. You'll have enough to take you\nanywhere you want to go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm very comfortable here,\" said Ginger Ted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, the day you come back, clean yourself up and come over to my\nhouse. We'll have a bottle of beer together.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That'll be fine. I guess I'll be ready for a good crack then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow chance steps in. The island to which Ginger Ted had been sent was\ncalled Maputiti, and like all the rest of them it was rocky heavily\nwooded and surrounded by a reef. There was a village among coconuts on\nthe sea-shore opposite the opening of the reef and another village on a\nbrackish lake in the middle of the island. Of this some of the\ninhabitants had been converted to Christianity. Communication with Baru\nwas effected by a launch that touched at the various islands at\nirregular intervals. It carried passengers and produce. But the\nvillagers were seafaring folk, and if they had to communicate urgently\nwith Baru, manned a prahu and sailed the fifty miles or so that\nseparated them from it. It happened that when Ginger Ted's sentence had\nbut another fortnight to run the Christian headman of the village on the\nlake was taken suddenly ill. The native remedies availed him nothing and\nhe writhed in agony. Messengers were sent to Baru imploring the\nmissionary's help; but as ill luck would have it Mr. Jones was suffering\nat the moment from an attack of malaria. He was in bed and unable to\nmove. He talked the matter over with his sister.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It sounds like acute appendicitis,\" he told her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't go, Owen,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't let the man die.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Jones had a temperature of a hundred and four. His head was aching\nlike mad. He had been delirious all night. His eyes were shining\nstrangely and his sister felt that he was holding on to his wits by a\nsheer effort of will.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You couldn't operate in the state you're in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I couldn't. Then Hassan must go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHassan was the dispenser.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You couldn't trust Hassan. He'd never dare to do an operation on his\nown responsibility. And they'd never let him. I'll go. Hassan can stay\nhere and look after you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't remove an appendix?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why not? I've seen you do it. I've done lots of minor operations.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Jones felt he didn't quite understand what she was saying.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is the launch in?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, it's gone to one of the islands. But I can go in the prahu the men\ncame in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You? I wasn't thinking of you. You can't go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going, Owen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Going where?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe saw that his mind was wandering already. She put her hand soothingly\non his dry forehead. She gave him a dose of medicine. He muttered\nsomething and she realised that he did not know where he was. Of course\nshe was anxious about him, but she knew that his illness was not\ndangerous, and she could leave him safely to the mission boy who was\nhelping her nurse him and to the native dispenser. She slipped out of\nthe room. She put her toilet things, a night-dress, and a change of\nclothes into a bag. A little chest with surgical instruments, bandages\nand antiseptic dressings was kept always ready. She gave them to the two\nnatives who had come over from Maputiti, and telling the dispenser what\nshe was going to do gave him instructions to inform her brother when he\nwas able to listen. Above all he was not to be anxious about her. She\nput on her topee and sallied forth. The mission was about half a mile\nfrom the village. She walked quickly. At the end of the jetty the prahu\nwas waiting. Six men manned it. She took her place in the stern and they\nset off with a rapid stroke. Within the reef the sea was calm, but when\nthey crossed the bar they came upon a long swell. But this was not the\nfirst journey of the sort Miss Jones had taken and she was confident of\nthe seaworthiness of the boat she was in. It was noon and the sun beat\ndown from a sultry sky. The only thing that harassed her was that they\ncould not arrive before dark, and if she found it necessary to operate\nat once she could count only on the light of hurricane lamps.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Jones was a woman of hard on forty. Nothing in her appearance would\nhave prepared you for such determination as she had just shown. She had\nan odd drooping gracefulness, which suggested that she might be swayed\nby every breeze; it was almost an affectation; and it made the strength\nof character which you soon discovered in her seem positively monstrous.\nShe was flat-chested, tall and extremely thin. She had a long sallow\nface and she was much afflicted with prickly heat. Her lank brown hair\nwas drawn back straight from her forehead. She had rather small eyes,\ngrey in colour, and because they were somewhat too close they gave her\nface a shrewish look. Her nose was long and thin and a trifle red. She\nsuffered a good deal from indigestion. But this infirmity availed\nnothing against her ruthless determination to look upon the bright side\nof things. Firmly persuaded that the world was evil and men unspeakably\nvicious, she extracted any little piece of decency she could find in\nthem with the modest pride with which a conjurer extracts a rabbit from\na hat. She was quick, resourceful and competent. When she arrived on the\nisland she saw that there was not a moment to lose if she was to save\nthe headman's life. Under the greatest difficulties, showing a native\nhow to give the anæsthetic, she operated, and for the next three days\nnursed the patient with anxious assiduity. Everything went very well and\nshe realised that her brother could not have made a better job of it.\nShe waited long enough to take out the stitches and then prepared to go\nhome. She could flatter herself that she had not wasted her time. She\nhad given medical attention to such as needed it, she had strengthened\nthe small Christian community in its faith, admonished such as were lax\nand cast the good seed in places where it might be hoped under divine\nprovidence to take root.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe launch, coming from one of the other islands, put in somewhat late\nin the afternoon, but it was full moon and they expected to reach Baru\nbefore midnight. They brought her things down to the wharf and the\npeople who were seeing her off stood about repeating their thanks. Quite\na little crowd collected. The launch was loaded with sacks of copra, but\nMiss Jones was used to its strong smell and it did not incommode her.\nShe made herself as comfortable a place to sit in as she could, and\nwaiting for the launch to start, chatted with her grateful flock. She\nwas the only passenger. Suddenly a group of natives emerged from the\ntrees that embowered the little village on the lagoon and she saw that\namong them was a white man. He wore a prison sarong and a baju. He had\nlong red hair. She at once recognised Ginger Ted. A policeman was with\nhim. They shook hands and Ginger Ted shook hands with the villagers who\naccompanied him. They bore bundles of fruit and a jar which Miss Jones\nguessed contained native spirit, and these they put in the launch. She\ndiscovered to her surprise that Ginger Ted was coming with her. His term\nwas up and instructions had arrived that he was to be returned to Baru\nin the launch. He gave her a glance, but did not nod--indeed Miss Jones\nturned away her head--and stepped in. The mechanic started his engine\nand in a moment they were jug-jugging through the channel in the lagoon.\nGinger Ted clambered on to a pile of sacks and lit a cigarette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Jones ignored him. Of course she knew him very well. Her heart sank\nwhen she thought that he was going to be once more in Baru, creating a\nscandal and drinking, a peril to the women and a thorn in the flesh of\nall decent people. She knew the steps her brother had taken to have him\ndeported and she had no patience with the Contrôleur, who would not see\na duty that stared him so plainly in the face. When they had crossed the\nbar and were in the open sea Ginger Ted took the stopper out of the jar\nof arak and putting his mouth to it took a long pull. Then he handed the\njar to the two mechanics who formed the crew. One was a middle-aged man\nand the other a youth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do not wish you to drink anything while we are on the journey,\" said\nMiss Jones sternly to the elder one.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe smiled at her and drank.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A little arak can do no one any harm,\" he answered. He passed the jar\nto his companion, who drank also.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you drink again I shall complain to the Contrôleur,\" said Miss\nJones.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe elder man said something she could not understand, but which she\nsuspected was very rude, and passed the jar back to Ginger Ted. They\nwent along for an hour or more. The sea was like glass and the sun set\nradiantly. It set behind one of the islands and for a few minutes\nchanged it into a mystic city of the skies. Miss Jones turned round to\nwatch it and her heart was filled with gratitude for the beauty of the\nworld.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And only man is vile,\" she quoted to herself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey went due east. In the distance was a little island which she knew\nthey passed close by. It was uninhabited. A rocky islet thickly grown\nwith virgin forest. The boatman lit his lamps. The night fell and\nimmediately the sky was thick with stars. The moon had not yet risen.\nSuddenly there was a slight jar and the launch began to vibrate\nstrangely. The engine rattled. The head mechanic, calling to his mate to\ntake the helm, crept under the housing. They seemed to be going more\nslowly. The engine stopped. She asked the youth what was the matter, but\nhe did not know. Ginger Ted got down from the top of the copra sacks and\nslipped under the housing. When he reappeared she would have liked to\nask him what had happened, but her dignity prevented her. She sat still\nand occupied herself with her thoughts. There was a long swell and the\nlaunch rolled slightly. The mechanic emerged once more into view and\nstarted the engine. Though it rattled like mad they began to move. The\nlaunch vibrated from stem to stern. They went very slowly. Evidently\nsomething was amiss, but Miss Jones was exasperated rather than alarmed.\nThe launch was supposed to do six knots, but now it was just crawling\nalong; at that rate they would not get into Baru till long, long after\nmidnight. The mechanic, still busy under the housing, shouted out\nsomething to the man at the helm. They spoke in Bugi, of which Miss\nJones knew very little. But after a while she noticed that they had\nchanged their course and seemed to be heading for the little uninhabited\nisland a good deal to the lee of which they should have passed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where are we going?\" she asked the helmsman with sudden misgiving.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe pointed to the islet. She got up and went to the housing and called\nto the man to come out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not going there? Why? What's the matter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't get to Baru,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But you must. I insist. I order you to go to Baru.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe man shrugged his shoulders. He turned his back on her and slipped\nonce more under the housing. Then Ginger Ted addressed her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One of the blades of the propeller has broken off. He thinks he can get\nas far as that island. We shall have to stay the night there and he'll\nput on a new propeller in the morning when the tide's out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't spend the night on an uninhabited island with three men,\" she\ncried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A lot of women would jump at it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I insist on going to Baru. Whatever happens we must get there\nto-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't get excited, old girl. We've got to beach the boat to put a new\npropeller on, and we shall be all right on the island.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How dare you speak to me like that! I think you're very insolent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll be O.K. We've got plenty of grub and we'll have a snack when we\nland. You have a drop of arak and you'll feel like a house on fire.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're an impertinent man. If you don't go to Baru I'll have you all\nput in prison.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We're not going to Baru. We can't. We're going to that island and if\nyou don't like it you can get out and swim.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, you'll pay for this.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shut up, you old cow,\" said Ginger Ted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Jones gave a gasp of anger. But she controlled herself. Even out\nthere, in the middle of the ocean, she had too much dignity to bandy\nwords with that vile wretch. The launch, the engine rattling horribly,\ncrawled on. It was pitch dark now, and she could no longer see the\nisland they were making for. Miss Jones, deeply incensed, sat with lips\ntight shut and a frown on her brow; she was not used to being crossed.\nThen the moon rose and she could see the bulk of Ginger Ted sprawling on\nthe top of the piled sacks of copra. The glimmer of his cigarette was\nstrangely sinister. Now the island was vaguely outlined against the sky.\nThey reached it and the boatman ran the launch on to the beach. Suddenly\nMiss Jones gave a gasp. The truth had dawned on her and her anger\nchanged to fear. Her heart beat violently. She shook in every limb. She\nfelt dreadfully faint. She saw it all. Was the broken propeller a put-up\njob or was it an accident? She could not be certain; anyhow, she knew\nthat Ginger Ted would seize the opportunity. Ginger Ted would rape her.\nShe knew his character. He was mad about women. That was what he had\ndone, practically, to the girl at the mission, such a good little thing\nshe was and an excellent sempstress; they would have prosecuted him for\nthat and he would have been sentenced to years of imprisonment only very\nunfortunately the innocent child had gone back to him several times and\nindeed had only complained of his ill usage when he left her for\nsomebody else. They had gone to the Contrôleur about it, but he had\nrefused to take any steps, saying in that coarse way of his that even if\nwhat the girl said was true, it didn't look very much as though it had\nbeen an altogether unpleasant experience. Ginger Ted was a scoundrel.\nAnd she was a white woman. What chance was there that he would spare\nher? None. She knew men. But she must pull herself together. She must\nkeep her wits about her. She must have courage. She was determined to\nsell her virtue dearly, and if he killed her----well, she would rather\ndie than yield. And if she died she would rest in the arms of Jesus. For\na moment a great light blinded her eyes and she saw the mansions of her\nHeavenly Father. They were a grand and sumptuous mixture of a picture\npalace and a railway station. The mechanics and Ginger Ted jumped out of\nthe launch and, waist-deep in water, gathered round the broken\npropeller. She took advantage of their preoccupation to get her case of\nsurgical instruments out of the box. She took out the four scalpels it\ncontained and secreted them in her clothing. If Ginger Ted touched her\nshe would not hesitate to plunge a scalpel in his heart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now then, miss, you'd better get out,\" said Ginger Ted. \"You'll be\nbetter off on the beach than in the boat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe thought so too. At least there she would have freedom of action.\nWithout a word she clambered over the copra sacks. He offered her his\nhand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want your help,\" she said coldly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can go to hell,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a little difficult to get out of the boat without showing her\nlegs, but by the exercise of considerable ingenuity she managed it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damned lucky we've got something to eat. We'll make a fire and then\nyou'd better have a snack and a nip of arak.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want nothing. I only want to be left alone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It won't hurt me if you go hungry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe did not answer. She walked, with head erect, along the beach. She\nheld the largest scalpel in her closed fist. The moon allowed her to see\nwhere she was going. She looked for a place to hide. The thick forest\ncame down to the very edge of the beach; but, afraid of its darkness\n(after all, she was but a woman), she dared not plunge into its depth.\nShe did not know what animals lurked there or what dangerous snakes.\nBesides, her instinct told her that it was better to keep those three\nbad men in sight; then if they came towards her she would be prepared.\nPresently she found a little hollow. She looked round. They seemed to be\noccupied with their own affairs and they could not see her. She slipped\nin. There was a rock between them and her so that she was hidden from\nthem and yet could watch them. She saw them go to and from the boat\ncarrying things. She saw them build a fire. It lit them luridly and she\nsaw them sit around it and eat, and she saw the jar of arak passed from\none to the other. They were all going to get drunk. What would happen to\nher then? It might be that she could cope with Ginger Ted, though his\nstrength terrified her, but against three she would be powerless. A mad\nidea came to her to go to Ginger Ted and fall on her knees before him\nand beg him to spare her. He must have some spark of decent feeling in\nhim and she had always been so convinced that there was good even in the\nworst of men. He must have had a mother. Perhaps he had a sister. Ah,\nbut how could you appeal to a man blinded with lust and drunk with arak?\nShe began to feel terribly weak. She was afraid she was going to cry.\nThat would never do. She needed all her self-control. She bit her lip.\nShe watched them, like a tiger watching his prey; no, not like that,\nlike a lamb watching three hungry wolves. She saw them put more wood on\nthe fire, and Ginger Ted, in his sarong, silhouetted by the flames.\nPerhaps after he had had his will of her he would pass her on to the\nothers. How could she go back to her brother when such a thing had\nhappened to her? Of course he would be sympathetic, but would he ever\nfeel quite the same to her again? It would break his heart. And perhaps\nhe would think that she ought to have resisted more. For his sake\nperhaps it would be better if she said nothing about it. Naturally the\nmen would say nothing. It would mean twenty years in prison for them.\nBut then supposing she had a baby. Miss Jones instinctively clenched her\nhands with horror and nearly cut herself with the scalpel. Of course it\nwould only infuriate them if she resisted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What shall I do?\" she cried. \"What have I done to deserve this?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe flung herself down on her knees and prayed to God to save her. She\nprayed long and earnestly. She reminded God that she was a virgin and\njust mentioned, in case it had slipped the divine memory, how much St.\nPaul had valued that excellent state. And then she peeped round the rock\nagain. The three men appeared to be smoking and the fire was dying down.\nNow was the time that Ginger Ted's lewd thoughts might be expected to\nturn to the woman who was at his mercy. She smothered a cry, for\nsuddenly he got up and walked in her direction. She felt all her muscles\ngrow taut, and though her heart was beating furiously she clenched the\nscalpel firmly in her hand. But it was for another purpose that Ginger\nTed had got up. Miss Jones blushed and looked away. He strolled slowly\nback to the others and sitting down again raised the jar of arak to his\nlips. Miss Jones, crouching behind the rock, watched with straining\neyes. The conversation round the fire grew less and presently she\ndivined, rather than saw, that the two natives wrapped themselves in\nblankets and composed themselves to slumber. She understood. This was\nthe moment Ginger Ted had been waiting for. When they were fast asleep\nhe would get up cautiously and without a sound, in order not to wake the\nothers, creep stealthily towards her. Was it that he was unwilling to\nshare her with them or did he know that his deed was so dastardly that\nhe did not wish them to know of it? After all, he was a white man and\nshe was a white woman. He could not have sunk so low as to allow her to\nsuffer the violence of natives. But his plan, which was so obvious to\nher, had given her an idea; when she saw him coming she would scream,\nshe would scream so loudly that it would wake the two mechanics. She\nremembered now that the elder, though he had only one eye, had a kind\nface. But Ginger Ted did not move. She was feeling terribly tired. She\nbegan to fear that she would not have the strength now to resist him.\nShe had gone through too much. She closed her eyes for a minute.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen she opened them it was broad daylight. She must have fallen asleep\nand, so shattered was she by emotion, have slept till long after dawn.\nIt gave her quite a turn. She sought to rise, but something caught in\nher legs. She looked and found that she was covered with two empty copra\nsacks. Someone had come in the night and put them over her. Ginger Ted!\nShe gave a little scream. The horrible thought flashed through her mind\nthat he had outraged her in her sleep. No. It was impossible. And yet he\nhad had her at his mercy. Defenceless. And he had spared her. She\nblushed furiously. She raised herself to her feet, feeling a little\nstiff, and arranged her disordered dress. The scalpel had fallen from\nher hand and she picked it up. She took the two copra sacks and emerged\nfrom her hiding-place. She walked towards the boat. It was floating in\nthe shallow water of the lagoon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come on, Miss Jones,\" said Ginger Ted. \"We've finished. I was just\ngoing to wake you up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe could not look at him, but she felt herself as red as a turkey cock.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have a banana?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWithout a word she took it. She was very hungry, and ate it with relish.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Step on this rock and you'll be able to get in without wetting your\nfeet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Jones felt as though she could sink into the ground with shame, but\nshe did as he told her. He took hold of her arm--good heavens! his hand\nwas like an iron vice, never, never could she have struggled with\nhim--and helped her into the launch. The mechanic started the engine and\nthey slid out of the lagoon. In three hours they were at Baru.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat evening, having been officially released, Ginger Ted went to the\nContrôleur's house. He wore no longer the prison uniform, but the ragged\nsinglet and the khaki shorts in which he had been arrested. He had had\nhis hair cut and it fitted his head now like a little curly red cap. He\nwas thinner. He had lost his bloated flabbiness and looked younger and\nbetter. Mr. Gruyter, a friendly grin on his round face, shook hands with\nhim and asked him to sit down. The boy brought two bottles of beer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm glad to see you hadn't forgotten my invitation, Ginger,\" said the\nContrôleur.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not likely. I've been looking forward to this for six months.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Here's luck, Ginger Ted.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Same to you, Contrôleur.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey emptied their glasses and the Contrôleur clapped his hands. The boy\nbrought two more bottles.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you don't bear me any malice for the sentence I gave you, I\nhope.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No bloody fear. I was mad for a minute, but I got over it. I didn't\nhave half a bad time, you know. Nice lot of girls on that island,\nContrôleur. You ought to give 'em a look over one of these days.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're a bad lot, Ginger.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Terrible.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good beer, isn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGinger Ted's remittance had been arriving every month and the Contrôleur\nnow had fifty pounds for him. When the damage he had done to the\nChinaman's shop was paid for there would still be over thirty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's quite a lot of money. Ginger. You ought to do something useful\nwith it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I mean to,\" answered Ginger. \"Spend it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, that's what money's for, I guess.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur gave his guest the news. Not much had happened during the\nlast six months. Time on the Alas Islands did not matter very much and\nthe rest of the world did not matter at all.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Any wars anywhere?\" asked Ginger Ted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. Not that I've noticed. Harry Jervis found a pretty big pearl. He\nsays he's going to ask a thousand quid for it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope he gets it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And Charlie McCormack's married.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He always was a bit soft.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSuddenly the boy appeared and said Mr. Jones wished to know if he might\ncome in. Before the Contrôleur could give an answer Mr. Jones walked in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I won't detain you long,\" he said. \"I've been trying to get hold of\nthis good man all day and when I heard he was here I thought you\nwouldn't mind my coming.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How is Miss Jones?\" asked the Contrôleur politely. \"None the worse for\nher night in the open, I trust.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's naturally a bit shaken. She had a temperature and I've insisted\non her going to bed, but I don't think it's serious.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe two men had got up on the missionary's entrance, and now the\nmissionary went up to Ginger Ted and held out his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want to thank you. You did a great and noble thing. My sister is\nright, one should always look for the good in their fellow-men; I am\nafraid I misjudged you in the past: I beg your pardon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe spoke very solemnly. Ginger Ted looked at him with amazement. He had\nnot been able to prevent the missionary taking his hand. He still held\nit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You had my sister at your mercy and you spared her. I thought you were\nall evil and I am ashamed. She was defenceless. She was in your power.\nYou had pity on her. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Neither my\nsister nor I will ever forget. God bless and guard you always.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Jones's voice shook a little and he turned his head away. He\nreleased Ginger Ted's hand and strode quickly to the door. Ginger Ted\nwatched him with a blank face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the blazes does he mean?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur laughed. He tried to control himself, but the more he did\nthe more he laughed. He shook and you saw the folds of his fat belly\nripple under the sarong. He leaned back in his long chair and rolled\nfrom side to side. He did not laugh only with his face, he laughed with\nhis whole body, and even the muscles of his podgy legs shook with mirth.\nHe held his aching ribs. Ginger Ted looked at him frowning, and because\nhe did not understand what the joke was he grew angry. He seized one of\nthe empty beer bottles by the neck.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you don't stop laughing, I'll break your bloody head open,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur mopped his face. He swallowed a mouthful of beer. He\nsighed and groaned because his sides were hurting him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's thanking you for having respected the virtue of Miss Jones,\" he\nspluttered at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Me?\" cried Ginger Ted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe thought took quite a long time to travel through his head, but when\nat last he got it he flew into a violent rage. There flowed from his\nmouth such a stream of blasphemous obscenities as would have startled a\nmarine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That old cow,\" he finished. \"What does he take me for?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You have the reputation of being rather hot stuff with the girls,\nGinger,\" giggled the little Contrôleur.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't touch her with the fag-end of a barge-pole. It never entered\nmy head. The nerve. I'll wring his blasted neck. Look here, give me my\nmoney, I'm going to get drunk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't blame you,\" said the Contrôleur.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That old cow,\" repeated Ginger Ted. \"That old cow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was shocked and outraged. The suggestion really shattered his sense\nof decency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur had the money at hand and having got Ginger Ted to sign\nthe necessary papers gave it to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go and get drunk, Ginger Ted,\" he said, \"but I warn you, if you get\ninto mischief it'll be twelve months' next time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shan't get into mischief,\" said Ginger Ted sombrely. He was suffering\nfrom a sense of injury. \"It's an insult,\" he shouted at the Contrôleur.\n\"That's what it is, it's a bloody insult.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe lurched out of the house, and as he went he muttered to himself:\n\"Dirty swine, dirty swine.\" Ginger Ted remained drunk for a week. Mr.\nJones went to see the Contrôleur again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm very sorry to hear that poor fellow has taken up his evil course\nagain,\" he said. \"My sister and I are dreadfully disappointed. I'm\nafraid it wasn't very wise to give him so much money at once.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was his own money. I had no right to keep it back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not a legal right, perhaps, but surely a moral right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe told the Contrôleur the story of that fearful night on the island.\nWith her feminine instinct, Miss Jones had realised that the man,\ninflamed with lust, was determined to take advantage of her, and,\nresolved to defend herself to the last, had armed herself with a\nscalpel. He told the Contrôleur how she had prayed and wept and how she\nhad hidden herself. Her agony was indescribable, and she knew that she\ncould never have survived the shame. She rocked to and fro and every\nmoment she thought he was coming. And there was no help anywhere and at\nlast she had fallen asleep; she was tired out, poor thing, she had\nundergone more than any human being could stand, and then when she awoke\nshe found that he had covered her with copra sacks. He had found her\nasleep, and surely it was her innocence, her very helplessness that had\nmoved him, he hadn't the heart to touch her; he covered her gently with\ntwo copra sacks and crept silently away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It shows you that deep down in him there is something sterling. My\nsister feels it's our duty to save him. We must do something for him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, in your place I wouldn't try till he's got through all his\nmoney,\" said the Contrôleur, \"and then if he's not in jail you can do\nwhat you like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Ginger Ted didn't want to be saved. About a fortnight after his\nrelease from prison he was sitting on a stool outside a Chinaman's shop\nlooking vacantly down the street when he saw Miss Jones coming along. He\nstared at her for a minute and once more amazement seized him. He\nmuttered to himself and there can be little doubt that his mutterings\nwere disrespectful. But then he noticed that Miss Jones had seen him and\nhe quickly turned his head away; he was conscious, notwithstanding, that\nshe was looking at him. She was walking briskly, but she sensibly\ndiminished her pace as she approached him. He thought she was going to\nstop and speak to him. He got up quickly and went into the shop. He did\nnot venture to come out for at least five minutes. Half an hour later\nMr. Jones himself came along and he went straight up to Ginger Ted with\noutstretched hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How do you do, Mr. Edward? My sister told me I should find you here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGinger Ted gave him a surly look and did not take the proffered hand. He\nmade no answer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'd be so very glad if you'd come to dinner with us next Sunday. My\nsister's a capital cook and she'll make you a real Australian dinner.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go to hell,\" said Ginger Ted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's not very gracious,\" said the missionary, but with a little laugh\nto show that he was not affronted. \"You go and see the Contrôleur from\ntime to time, why shouldn't you come and see us? It's pleasant to talk\nto white people now and then. Won't you let bygones be bygones? I can\nassure you of a very cordial welcome.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't got clothes fit to go out in,\" said Ginger Ted sulkily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, never mind about that. Come as you are.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I won't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why not? You must have a reason.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGinger Ted was a blunt man. He had no hesitation in saying what we\nshould all like to when we receive unwelcome invitations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry. My sister will be very disappointed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Jones, determined to show that he was not in the least offended,\ngave him a breezy nod and walked on. Forty-eight hours later there\nmysteriously arrived at the house in which Ginger Ted lodged a parcel\ncontaining a suit of ducks, a tennis shirt, a pair of socks and some\nshoes. He was unaccustomed to receiving presents and next time he saw\nthe Contrôleur asked him if it was he who had sent the things.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not on your life,\" replied the Contrôleur. \"I'm perfectly indifferent\nto the state of your wardrobe.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, then, who the hell can have?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Search me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was necessary from time to time for Miss Jones to see Mr. Gruyter on\nbusiness and shortly after this she came to see him one morning in his\noffice. She was a capable woman and though she generally wanted him to\ndo something he had no mind to, she did not waste his time. He was a\nlittle surprised then to discover that she had come on a very trivial\nerrand. When he told her that he could not take cognizance of the matter\nin question, she did not as was her habit try to convince him, but\naccepted his refusal as definite. She got up to go and then as though it\nwere an afterthought said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Mr. Gruyter, my brother is very anxious that we should have the man\nthey call Ginger Ted to supper with us and I've written him a little\nnote inviting him for the day after to-morrow. I think he's rather shy,\nand I wonder if you'd come with him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's very kind of you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My brother feels that we ought to do something for the poor fellow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A woman's influence and all that sort of thing,\" said the Contrôleur\ndemurely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you persuade him to come? I'm sure he will if you make a point of\nit, and when he knows the way he'll come again. It seems such a pity to\nlet a young man like that go to pieces altogether.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur looked up at her. She was several inches taller than he.\nHe thought her very unattractive. She reminded him strangely of wet\nlinen hung on a clothes-line to dry. His eyes twinkled, but he kept a\nstraight face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll do my best,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How old is he?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"According to his passport he's thirty-one.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what is his real name?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wilson.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Edward Wilson,\" she said softly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's astonishing that after the life he's led he should be so strong,\"\nmurmured the Contrôleur. \"He has the strength of an ox.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Those red-headed men sometimes are very powerful,\" said Miss Jones, but\nspoke as though she were choking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite so,\" said the Contrôleur.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen for no obvious reason Miss Jones blushed. She hurriedly said\ngood-bye to the Contrôleur and left his office.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Godverdomme</i>!\" said the Contrôleur.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe knew now who had sent Ginger Ted the new clothes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe met him during the course of the day and asked him whether he had\nheard from Miss Jones. Ginger Ted took a crumpled ball of paper out of\nhis pocket and gave it to him. It was the invitation. It ran as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>\nDear Mr. Wilson,--\n<br>\n&nbsp;\n<br>\nMy brother and I would be so very glad if you would come and\nhave supper with us next Thursday at 7.30. The Contrôleur has\nkindly promised to come. We have some new records from Australia\nwhich I am sure you will like. I am afraid I was not very nice\nto you last time we met, but I did not know you so well then,\nand I am big enough to admit it when I have committed an error.\nI hope you will forgive me and let me be your friend,\n<br>\n&nbsp;\n<br>\nYours Sincerely,\n<br>\nMartha Jones.\n</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur noticed that she addressed him as Mr. Wilson and referred\nto his own promise to go, so that when she told him she had already\ninvited Ginger Ted she had a little anticipated the truth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not going, if that's what you mean. Damned nerve.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must answer the letter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I won't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now look here, Ginger, you put on those new clothes and you come as a\nfavour to me. I've got to go and, damn it all, you can't leave me in the\nlurch. It won't hurt you just once.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGinger Ted looked at the Contrôleur suspiciously, but his face was\nserious and his manner sincere: he could not guess that within him the\nDutchman bubbled with laughter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the devil do they want me for?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. The pleasure of your society, I suppose.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will there be any booze?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, but come up to my house at seven, and we'll have a tiddly before we\ngo.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, all right,\" said Ginger Ted sulkily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur rubbed his little fat hands with joy. He was expecting a\ngreat deal of amusement from the party. But when Thursday came and seven\no'clock, Ginger Ted was dead drunk and Mr. Gruyter had to go alone. He\ntold the missionary and his sister the plain truth. Mr. Jones shook his\nhead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid it's no good, Martha, the man's hopeless.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a moment Miss Jones was silent and the Contrôleur saw two tears\ntrickle down her long thin nose. She bit her lip.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No one is hopeless. Everyone has some good in him. I shall pray for him\nevery night. It would be wicked to doubt the power of God.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPerhaps Miss Jones was right in this, but the divine providence took a\nvery funny way of effecting its ends. Ginger Ted began to drink more\nheavily than ever. He was so troublesome that even Mr. Gruyter lost\npatience with him. He made up his mind that he could not have the fellow\non the islands any more and resolved to deport him on the next boat that\ntouched at Baru. Then a man died under mysterious circumstances after\nhaving been for a trip to one of the islands and the Contrôleur learnt\nthat there had been several deaths on the same island. He sent the\nChinese who was the official doctor of the group to look into the\nmatter, and very soon received intelligence that the deaths were due to\ncholera. Two more took place at Baru and the certainty was forced upon\nhim that there was an epidemic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur cursed freely. He cursed in Dutch, he cursed in English\nand he cursed in Malay. Then he drank a bottle of beer and smoked a\ncigar. After that he took thought. He knew the Chinese doctor would be\nuseless. He was a nervous little man from Java and the natives would\nrefuse to obey his orders. The Contrôleur was efficient and knew pretty\nwell what must be done, but he could not do everything single-handed. He\ndid not like Mr. Jones, but just then he was thankful that he was at\nhand, and he sent for him at once. He was accompanied by his sister.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know what I want to see you about, Mr. Jones,\" he said abruptly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. I've been expecting a message from you. That is why my sister has\ncome with me. We are ready to put all our resources at your disposal. I\nneed not tell you that my sister is as competent as a man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know. I shall be very glad of her assistance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey set to without further delay to discuss the steps that must be\ntaken. Hospital huts would have to be erected and quarantine stations.\nThe inhabitants of the various villages on the islands must be forced to\ntake proper precautions. In a good many cases the infected villages drew\ntheir water from the same well as the uninfected, and in each case this\ndifficulty would have to be dealt with according to circumstances. It\nwas necessary to send round people to give orders and make sure that\nthey were carried out. Negligence must be ruthlessly punished. The worst\nof it was that the natives would not obey other natives, and orders\ngiven by native policemen, themselves unconvinced of their efficacy,\nwould certainly be disregarded. It was advisable for Mr. Jones to stay\nat Baru, where the population was largest and his medical attention most\nwanted; and what with the official duties that forced him to keep in\ntouch with his headquarters, it was impossible for Mr. Gruyter to visit\nall the other islands himself. Miss Jones must go; but the natives of\nsome of the outlying islands were wild and treacherous; the Contrôleur\nhad had a good deal of trouble with them. He did not like the idea of\nexposing her to danger.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not afraid,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I daresay. But if you have your throat cut I shall get into trouble,\nand besides, we're so short-handed I don't want to risk losing your\nhelp.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then let Mr. Wilson come with me. He knows the natives better than\nanyone and can speak all their dialects.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ginger Ted?\" The Contrôleur stared at her. \"He's just getting over an\nattack of D.Ts.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know a great deal, Miss Jones.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEven though the moment was so serious Mr. Gruyter could not but smile.\nHe gave her a sharp look, but she met it coolly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's nothing like responsibility for bringing out what there is in a\nman, and I think something like this may be the making of him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think it would be wise to trust yourself for days at a time to a\nman of such infamous character?\" said the missionary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I put my trust in God,\" she answered gravely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think he'd be any use?\" asked the Contrôleur. \"You know what he\nis.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm convinced of it.\" Then she blushed. \"After all, no one knows better\nthan I that he's capable of self-control.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur bit his lip.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let's send for him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave a message to the sergeant and in a few minutes Ginger Ted stood\nbefore them. He looked ill. He had evidently been much shaken by his\nrecent attack and his nerves were all to pieces. He was in rags and he\nhad not shaved for a week. No one could have looked more disreputable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, Ginger,\" said the Contrôleur, \"it's about this cholera\nbusiness. We've got to force the natives to take precautions and we want\nyou to help us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why the hell should I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No reason at all. Except philanthropy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing doing, Contrôleur. I'm not a philanthropist.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That settles that. That was all. You can go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut as Ginger Ted turned to the door Miss Jones stopped him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was my suggestion, Mr. Wilson. You see, they want me to go to Labobo\nand Sakunchi, and the natives there are so funny I was afraid to go\nalone. I thought if you came I should be safer.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave her a look of extreme distaste.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you suppose I care if they cut your throat?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Jones looked at him and her eyes filled with tears. She began to\ncry. He stood and watched her stupidly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no reason why you should.\" She pulled herself together and\ndried her eyes. \"I'm being silly. I shall be all right. I'll go alone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's damned foolishness for a woman to go to Labobo.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a little smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I daresay it is, but, you see, it's my job and I can't help myself. I'm\nsorry if I offended you by asking you. You must forget about it. I\ndaresay it wasn't quite fair to ask you to take such a risk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor quite a minute Ginger Ted stood and looked at her. He shifted from\none foot to the other. His surly face seemed to grow black.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, hell, have it your own way,\" he said at last. \"I'll come with you.\nWhen d'you want to start?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey set out next day, with drugs and disinfectants, in the Government\nlaunch. Mr. Gruyter as soon as he had put the necessary work in order\nwas to start off in a prahu in the other direction. For four months the\nepidemic raged. Though everything possible was done to localise it one\nisland after another was attacked. The Contrôleur was busy from morning\nto night. He had no sooner got back to Baru from one or other of the\nislands to do what was necessary there than he had to set off again. He\ndistributed food and medicine. He cheered the terrified people. He\nsupervised everything. He worked like a dog. He saw nothing of Ginger\nTed, but he heard from Mr. Jones that the experiment was working out\nbeyond all hopes. The scamp was behaving himself. He had a way with the\nnatives; and by cajolery, firmness and on occasion the use of his fist,\nmanaged to make them take the steps necessary for their own safety. Miss\nJones could congratulate herself on the success of the scheme. But the\nContrôleur was too tired to be amused. When the epidemic had run its\ncourse he rejoiced because out of a population of eight thousand only\nsix hundred had died.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFinally he was able to give the district a clean bill of health.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne evening he was sitting in his sarong on the verandah of his house\nand he read a French novel with the happy consciousness that once more\nhe could take things easy. His head boy came in and told him that Ginger\nTed wished to see him. He got up from his chair and shouted to him to\ncome in. Company was just what he wanted. It had crossed the\nContrôleur's mind that it would be pleasant to get drunk that night, but\nit is dull to get drunk alone, and he had regretfully put the thought\naside. And heaven had sent Ginger Ted in the nick of time. By God, they\nwould make a night of it. After four months they deserved a bit of fun.\nGinger Ted entered. He was wearing a clean suit of white ducks. He was\nshaved. He looked another man.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, Ginger, you look as if you'd been spending a month at a health\nresort instead of nursing a pack of natives dying of cholera. And look\nat your clothes. Have you just stepped out of a bandbox?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGinger Ted smiled rather sheepishly. The head boy brought two bottles of\nbeer and poured them out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Help yourself, Ginger,\" said the Contrôleur as he took his glass.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think I'll have any, thank you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur put down his glass and looked at Ginger Ted with\namazement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, what's the matter? Aren't you thirsty?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't mind having a cup of tea.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A cup of what?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm on the wagon. Martha and I are going to be married.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ginger!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur's eyes popped out of his head. He scratched his shaven\npate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't marry Miss Jones,\" he said. \"No one could marry Miss Jones.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'm going to. That's what I've come to see you about. Owen's\ngoing to marry us in chapel, but we want to be married by Dutch law as\nwell.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A joke's a joke, Ginger. What's the idea?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She wanted it. She fell for me that night we spent on the island when\nthe propeller broke. She's not a bad old girl when you get to know her.\nIt's her last chance, if you understand what I mean, and I'd like to do\nsomething to oblige her. And she wants someone to take care of her,\nthere's no doubt about that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ginger, Ginger, before you can say knife she'll make you into a damned\nmissionary.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know that I'd mind that so much if we had a little mission of\nour own. She says I'm a bloody marvel with the natives. She says I can\ndo more with a native in five minutes than Owen can do in a year. She\nsays she's never known anyone with the magnetism I have. It seems a pity\nto waste a gift like that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur looked at him without speaking and slowly nodded his head\nthree or four times. She'd nobbled him all right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've converted seventeen already,\" said Ginger Ted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You? I didn't know you believed in Christianity.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I don't know that I did exactly, but when I talked to 'em and\nthey just came into the fold like a lot of blasted sheep, well, it gave\nme quite a turn. Blimey, I said, I daresay there's something in it after\nall.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You should have raped her, Ginger. I wouldn't have been hard on you. I\nwouldn't have given you more than three years' and three years' is soon\nover.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, Contrôleur, don't you ever let on that the thought never\nentered my head. Women are touchy, you know, and she'd be as sore as\nhell if she knew that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guessed she'd got her eye on you, but I never thought it would come\nto this.\" The Contrôleur in an agitated manner walked up and down the\nverandah. \"Listen to me, old boy,\" he said after an interval of\nreflection, \"we've had some grand times together and a friend's a\nfriend. I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll lend you the launch and you can\ngo and hide on one of the islands till the next ship comes along and\nthen I'll get 'em to slow down and take you on board. You've only got\none chance now and that's to cut and run.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGinger Ted shook his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's no good, Contrôleur, I know you mean well, but I'm going to marry\nthe blasted woman, and that's that. You don't know the joy of bringing\nall them bleeding sinners to repentance, and Christ! that girl can make\na treacle pudding. I haven't eaten a better one since I was a kid.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur was very much disturbed. The drunken scamp was his only\ncompanion on the islands and he did not want to lose him. He discovered\nthat he had even a certain affection for him. Next day he went to see\nthe missionary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's this I hear about your sister marrying Ginger Ted?\" he asked\nhim. \"It's the most extraordinary thing I've ever heard in my life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's true nevertheless.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must do something about it. It's madness.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My sister is of full age and entitled to do as she pleases.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But you don't mean to tell me you approve of it. You know Ginger Ted.\nHe's a bum and there are no two ways about it. Have you told her the\nrisk she's running? I mean, bringing sinners to repentance and all that\nsort of thing's all right, but there are limits. And does the leopard\never change his spots?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen for the first time in his life the Contrôleur saw a twinkle in the\nmissionary's eye.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My sister is a very determined woman, Mr. Gruyter,\" he replied. \"From\nthat night they spent on the island he never had a chance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur gasped. He was as surprised as the prophet when the Lord\nopened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done\nunto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? Perhaps Mr.\nJones was human after all.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Allejesus</i>!\" muttered the Contrôleur.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBefore anything more could be said Miss Jones swept into the room. She\nwas radiant. She looked ten years younger. Her cheeks were flushed and\nher nose was hardly red at all.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you come to congratulate me, Mr. Gruyter?\" she cried, and her\nmanner was sprightly and girlish. \"You see, I was right after all.\nEveryone has some good in them. You don't know how splendid Edward has\nbeen all through this terrible time. He's a hero. He's a saint. Even I\nwas surprised.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope you'll be very happy, Miss Jones.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know I shall. Oh, it would be wicked of me to doubt it. For it is the\nLord who has brought us together.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think so?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know it. Don't you see? Except for the cholera Edward would never\nhave found himself. Except for the cholera we should never have learnt\nto know one another. I have never seen the hand of God more plainly\nmanifest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur could not but think that it was rather a clumsy device to\nbring those two together that necessitated the death of six hundred\ninnocent persons, but not being well versed in the ways of omnipotence\nhe made no remark.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll never guess where we're going for our honeymoon,\" said Miss\nJones, perhaps a trifle archly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Java?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, if you'll lend us the launch, we're going to that island where we\nwere marooned. It has very tender recollections for both of us. It was\nthere that I first guessed how fine and good Edward was. It's there I\nwant him to have his reward.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Contrôleur caught his breath. He left quickly, for he thought that\nunless he had a bottle of beer at once he would have a fit. He was never\nso shocked in his life.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI could never understand why Louise bothered with me. She disliked me\nand I knew that behind my back, in that gentle way of hers, she seldom\nlost the opportunity of saying a disagreeable thing about me. She had\ntoo much delicacy ever to make a direct statement, but with a hint and a\nsigh and a little flutter of her beautiful hands she was able to make\nher meaning plain. She was a mistress of cold praise. It was true that\nwe had known one another almost intimately, for five-and-twenty years,\nbut it was impossible for me to believe that she could be affected by\nthe claims of old association. She thought me a coarse, brutal, cynical\nand vulgar fellow. I was puzzled at her not taking the obvious course\nand dropping me. She did nothing of the kind; indeed, she would not\nleave me alone; she was constantly asking me to lunch and dine with her\nand once or twice a year invited me to spend a week-end at her house in\nthe country. At last I thought that I had discovered her motive. She had\nan uneasy suspicion that I did not believe in her; and if that was why\nshe did not like me, it was also why she sought my acquaintance: it\ngalled her that I alone should look upon her as a comic figure and she\ncould not rest till I acknowledged myself mistaken and defeated. Perhaps\nshe had an inkling that I saw the face behind the mask and because I\nalone held out was determined that sooner or later I too should take the\nmask for the face. I was never quite certain that she was a complete\nhumbug. I wondered whether she fooled herself as thoroughly as she\nfooled the world or whether there was some spark of humour at the bottom\nof her heart. If there was it might be that she was attracted to me, as\na pair of crooks might be attracted to one another, by the knowledge\nthat we shared a secret that was hidden from everybody else.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI knew Louise before she married. She was then a frail, delicate girl\nwith large and melancholy eyes. Her father and mother worshipped her\nwith an anxious adoration, for some illness, scarlet fever I think, had\nleft her with a weak heart and she had to take the greatest care of\nherself. When Tom Maitland proposed to her they were dismayed, for they\nwere convinced that she was much too delicate for the strenuous state of\nmarriage. But they were not too well off and Tom Maitland was rich. He\npromised to do everything in the world for Louise and finally they\nentrusted her to him as a sacred charge. Tom Maitland was a big, husky\nfellow, very good-looking and a fine athlete. He doted on Louise. With\nher weak heart he could not hope to keep her with him long and he made\nup his mind to do everything he could to make her few years on earth\nhappy. He gave up the games he excelled in, not because she wished him\nto, she was glad that he should play golf and hunt, but because by a\ncoincidence she had a heart attack whenever he proposed to leave her for\na day. If they had a difference of opinion she gave in to him at once,\nfor she was the most submissive wife a man could have, but her heart\nfailed her and she would be laid up, sweet and uncomplaining, for a\nweek. He could not be such a brute as to cross her. Then they would have\nquite a little tussle about which should yield and it was only with\ndifficulty that at last he persuaded her to have her own way. On one\noccasion seeing her walk eight miles on an expedition that she\nparticularly wanted to make, I suggested to Tom Maitland that she was\nstronger than one would have thought. He shook his head and sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, no, she's dreadfully delicate. She's been to all the best heart\nspecialists in the world and they all say that her life hangs on a\nthread. But she has an unconquerable spirit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe told her that I had remarked on her endurance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall pay for it to-morrow,\" she said to me in her plaintive way. \"I\nshall be at death's door.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I sometimes think that you're quite strong enough to do the things you\nwant to,\" I murmured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had noticed that if a party was amusing she could dance till five in\nthe morning, but if it was dull she felt very poorly and Tom had to take\nher home early. I am afraid she did not like my reply, for though she\ngave me a pathetic little smile I saw no amusement in her large blue\neyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't very well expect me to fall down dead just to please you,\"\nshe answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLouise outlived her husband. He caught his death of cold one day when\nthey were sailing and Louise needed all the rugs there were to keep her\nwarm. He left her a comfortable fortune and a daughter. Louise was\ninconsolable. It was wonderful that she managed to survive the shock.\nHer friends expected her speedily to follow poor Tom Maitland to the\ngrave. Indeed they already felt dreadfully sorry for Iris, her daughter,\nwho would be left an orphan. They redoubled their attentions towards\nLouise. They would not let her stir a finger; they insisted on doing\neverything in the world to save her trouble. They had to, because if she\nwas called upon to do anything tiresome or inconvenient her heart went\nback on her and there she was at death's door. She was entirely lost\nwithout a man to take care of her, she said, and she did not know how,\nwith her delicate health, she was going to bring up her dear Iris. Her\nfriends asked why she did not marry again. Oh, with her heart it was out\nof the question, though of course she knew that dear Tom would have\nwished her to, and perhaps it would be the best thing for Iris if she\ndid; but who would want to be bothered with a wretched invalid like\nherself? Oddly enough more than one young man showed himself quite ready\nto undertake the charge and a year after Tom's death she allowed George\nHobhouse to lead her to the altar. He was a fine, upstanding fellow and\nhe was not at all badly off. I never saw anyone so grateful as he for\nthe privilege of being allowed to take care of this frail little thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shan't live to trouble you long,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was a soldier and an ambitious one, but he resigned his commission.\nLouise's health forced her to spend the winter at Monte Carlo and the\nsummer at Deauville. He hesitated a little at throwing up his career,\nand Louise at first would not hear of it; but at last she yielded as she\nalways yielded, and he prepared to make his wife's last few years as\nhappy as might be.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It can't be very long now,\" she said. \"I'll try not to be troublesome.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor the next two or three years Louise managed, notwithstanding her weak\nheart, to go beautifully dressed to all the most lively parties, to\ngamble very heavily, to dance and even to flirt with tall slim young\nmen. But George Hobhouse had not the stamina of Louise's first husband\nand he had to brace himself now and then with a stiff drink for his\nday's work as Louise's second husband. It is possible that the habit\nwould have grown on him, which Louise would not have liked at all, but\nvery fortunately (for her) the war broke out. He rejoined his regiment\nand three months later was killed. It was a great shock to Louise. She\nfelt, however, that in such a crisis she must not give way to a private\ngrief; and if she had a heart attack nobody heard of it. In order to\ndistract her mind she turned her villa at Monte Carlo into a hospital\nfor convalescent officers. Her friends told her that she would never\nsurvive the strain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course it will kill me,\" she said, \"I know that. But what does it\nmatter? I must do my bit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt didn't kill her. She had the time of her life. There was no\nconvalescent home in France that was more popular. I met her by chance\nin Paris. She was lunching at the Ritz with a tall and very handsome\nyoung Frenchman. She explained that she was there on business connected\nwith the hospital. She told me that the officers were too charming to\nher. They knew how delicate she was and they wouldn't let her do a\nsingle thing. They took care of her, well--as though they were all her\nhusbands. She sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor George, who would ever have thought that I with my heart should\nsurvive him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And poor Tom!\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI don't know why she didn't like my saying that. She gave me her\nplaintive smile and her beautiful eyes filled with tears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You always speak as though you grudged me the few years that I can\nexpect to live.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, your heart's much better, isn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It'll never be better. I saw a specialist this morning and he said I\nmust be prepared for the worst.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, well, you've been prepared for that for nearly twenty years now,\nhaven't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen the war came to an end Louise settled in London. She was now a\nwoman of over forty, thin and frail still, with large eyes and pale\ncheeks, but she did not look a day more than twenty-five. Iris, who had\nbeen at school and was now grown up, came to live with her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She'll take care of me,\" said Louise. \"Of course it'll be hard on her\nto live with such a great invalid as I am, but it can only be for such a\nlittle while, I'm sure she won't mind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIris was a nice girl. She had been brought up with the knowledge that\nher mother's health was precarious. As a child she had never been\nallowed to make a noise. She had always realised that her mother must on\nno account be upset. And though Louise told her now that she would not\nhear of her sacrificing herself for a tiresome old woman the girl simply\nwould not listen. It wasn't a question of sacrificing herself, it was a\nhappiness to do what she could for her poor dear mother. With a sigh her\nmother let her do a great deal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It pleases the child to think she's making herself useful,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you think she ought to go out and about more?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's what I'm always telling her. I can't get her to enjoy herself.\nHeaven knows, I never want anyone to put themselves out on my account.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd Iris, when I remonstrated with her, said: \"Poor dear mother, she\nwants me to go and stay with friends and go to parties, but the moment I\nstart off anywhere she has one of her heart attacks, so I much prefer to\nstay at home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut presently she fell in love. A young friend of mine, a very good lad,\nasked her to marry him and she consented. I liked the child and was glad\nthat she was to be given at last the chance to lead a life of her own.\nShe had never seemed to suspect that such a thing was possible. But one\nday the young man came to me in great distress and told me that his\nmarriage was indefinitely postponed. Iris felt that she could not desert\nher mother. Of course it was really no business of mine, but I made the\nopportunity to go and see Louise. She was always glad to receive her\nfriends at teatime and now that she was older she cultivated the society\nof painters and writers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I hear that Iris isn't going to be married,\" I said after a\nlittle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know about that. She's not going to be married quite as soon as\nI could have wished. I've begged her on my bended knees not to consider\nme, but she absolutely refuses to leave me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you think it's rather hard on her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dreadfully. Of course it can only be for a few months, but I hate the\nthought of anyone sacrificing themselves for me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear Louise, you've buried two husbands, I can't see the least\nreason why you shouldn't bury at least two more.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think that's funny?\" she asked me in a tone that she made as\noffensive as she could.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose it's never struck you as strange that you're always strong\nenough to do anything you want to and that your weak heart only prevents\nyou from doing things that bore you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I know, I know what you've always thought of me. You've never\nbelieved that I had anything the matter with me, have you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI looked at her full and square.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never. I think you've carried out for twenty-five years a stupendous\nbluff. I think you're the most selfish and monstrous woman I have ever\nknown. You ruined the lives of those two wretched men you married and\nnow you're going to ruin the life of your daughter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI should not have been surprised if Louise had had a heart attack then.\nI fully expected her to fly into a passion. She merely gave me a gentle\nsmile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My poor friend, one of these days you'll be so dreadfully sorry you\nsaid this to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you quite determined that Iris shall not marry this boy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've begged her to marry him. I know it'll kill me, but I don't mind.\nNobody cares for me. I'm just a burden to everybody.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you tell her it would kill you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She made me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As if anyone ever made you do anything that you were not yourself quite\ndetermined to do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She can marry her young man to-morrow if she likes. If it kills me, it\nkills me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, let's risk it, shall we?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Haven't you got any compassion for me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One can't pity anyone who amuses one as much as you amuse me,\" I\nanswered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA faint spot of colour appeared on Louise's pale cheeks and though she\nsmiled still her eyes were hard and angry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Iris shall marry in a month's time,\" she said, \"and if anything happens\nto me I hope you and she will be able to forgive yourselves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLouise was as good as her word. A date was fixed, a trousseau of great\nmagnificence was ordered, and invitations were issued. Iris and the very\ngood lad were radiant. On the wedding-day, at ten o'clock in the\nmorning, Louise, that devilish woman, had one of her heart attacks--and\ndied. She died gently forgiving Iris for having killed her.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nMy wife is a very unpunctual woman, so when, having arranged to lunch\nwith her at Claridge's, I arrived there ten minutes late and did not\nfind her I was not surprised. I ordered a cocktail. It was the height of\nthe season and there were but two or three vacant tables in the lounge.\nSome of the people after an early meal were drinking their coffee,\nothers like myself were toying with a dry Martini; the women in their\nsummer frocks looked gay and charming and the men debonair; but I could\nsee no one whose appearance sufficiently interested me to occupy the\nquarter of an hour I was expecting to wait. They were slim and pleasant\nto look upon, well dressed and carelessly at ease, but they were for the\nmost part of a pattern and I observed them with tolerance rather than\nwith curiosity. But it was two o'clock and I felt hungry. My wife tells\nme that she can neither wear a turquoise nor a watch, for the turquoise\nturns green and the watch stops; and this she attributes to the\nmalignity of fate. I have nothing to say about the turquoise, but I\nsometimes think the watch might go if she wound it. I was engaged with\nthese reflections when an attendant came up and with that hushed\nsignificance that hotel attendants affect (as though their message held\na more sinister meaning than their words suggested) told me that a lady\nhad just telephoned to say that she had been detained and could not\nlunch with me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI hesitated. It is not very amusing to eat in a crowded restaurant by\noneself, but it was late to go to a club and I decided that I had better\nstay where I was. I strolled into the dining-room. It has never given me\nany particular satisfaction (as it appears to do to so many elegant\npersons) to be known by name to the head waiters of fashionable\nrestaurants, but on this occasion I should certainly have been glad to\nbe greeted by less stony an eye. The <i>maître d'hôtel</i> with a set and\nhostile face told me that every table was occupied. I looked helplessly\nround the large and stately room and on a sudden to my pleasure caught\nsight of someone I knew. Lady Elizabeth Vermont was an old friend. She\nsmiled and noticing that she was alone I went up to her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you take pity on a hungry man and let me sit with you?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, do. But I've nearly finished.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was at a little table by the side of a massive column and when I\ntook my place I found that notwithstanding the crowd we sat almost in\nprivacy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is a bit of luck for me,\" I said. \"I was on the point of fainting\nfrom hunger.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe had a very agreeable smile; it did not light up her face suddenly,\nbut seemed rather to suffuse it by degrees with charm. It hesitated for\na moment about her lips and then slowly travelled to those great shining\neyes of hers and there softly lingered. No one surely could say that\nElizabeth Vermont was cast in the common mould. I never knew her when\nshe was a girl, but many have told me that then she was so lovely, it\nbrought the tears to one's eyes, and I could well believe it; for now,\nthough fifty, she was still incomparable. Her ravaged beauty made the\nfresh and blooming comeliness of youth a trifle insipid. I do not like\nthese painted faces that look all alike; and I think women are foolish\nto dull their expression and obscure their personality with powder,\nrouge and lipstick. But Elizabeth Vermont painted not to imitate nature,\nbut to improve it; you did not question the means but applauded the\nresult. The flaunting boldness with which she used cosmetics increased\nrather than diminished the character of that perfect face. I suppose her\nhair was dyed; it was black and sleek and shining. She held herself\nupright as though she had never learned to loll and she was very slim.\nShe wore a dress of black satin, the lines and simplicity of which were\nadmirable, and about her neck was a long rope of pearls. Her only other\njewel was an enormous emerald which guarded her wedding-ring, and its\nsombre fire emphasised the whiteness of her hand. But it was in her\nhands with their reddened nails that she most clearly betrayed her age;\nthey had none of a girl's soft and dimpled roundness; and you could not\nbut look at them with a certain dismay. Before very long they would look\nlike the talons of a bird of prey.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nElizabeth Vermont was a remarkable woman. Of great birth, for she was\nthe daughter of the seventh Duke of St. Erth, she married at the age of\neighteen a very rich man and started at once upon a career of astounding\nextravagance, lewdness and dissipation. She was too proud to be\ncautious, too reckless to think of consequences, and within two years\nher husband in circumstances of appalling scandal divorced her. She\nmarried then one of the three co-respondents named in the case and\neighteen months later ran away from him. Then followed a succession of\nlovers. She became notorious for her profligacy. Her startling beauty\nand her scandalous conduct held her in the public eye and it was never\nvery long but that she gave the gossips something to talk about. Her\nname stank in the nostrils of decent people. She was a gambler, a\nspendthrift and a wanton. But though unfaithful to her lovers she was\nconstant to her friends and there always remained a few who would never\nallow, whatever she did, that she was anything but a very nice woman.\nShe had candour, high spirits and courage. She was never a hypocrite.\nShe was generous and sincere. It was at this period of her life that I\ncame to know her; for great ladies, now that religion is out of fashion,\nwhen they are very much blown upon take a flattering interest in the\narts. When they receive the cold shoulder from members of their own\nclass they condescend sometimes to the society of writers, painters and\nmusicians. I found her an agreeable companion. She was one of those\nblessed persons who say quite fearlessly what they think (thus saving\nmuch useful time) and she had a ready wit. She was always willing to\ntalk (with a diverting humour) of her lurid past. Her conversation,\nthough uninstructed, was good, because, notwithstanding everything, she\nwas an honest woman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen she did a very surprising thing. At the age of forty she married a\nboy of twenty-one. Her friends said it was the maddest act of all her\nlife, and some who had stuck to her through thick and thin, now for the\nboy's sake, because he was nice and it seemed shameful thus to take\nadvantage of his inexperience, refused to have anything more to do with\nher. It really was the limit. They prophesied disaster, for Elizabeth\nVermont was incapable of sticking to any man for more than six months,\nnay, they hoped for it, since it seemed the only chance for the wretched\nyouth that his wife should behave so scandalously that he must leave\nher. They were all wrong. I do not know whether time was responsible for\na change of heart in her, or whether Peter Vermont's innocence and\nsimple love touched her, but the fact remains that she made him an\nadmirable wife. They were poor, and she was extravagant, but she became\na thrifty housewife; she grew on a sudden so careful of her reputation\nthat the tongue of scandal was silenced. His happiness seemed her only\nconcern. No one could doubt that she loved him devotedly. After being\nthe subject of so much conversation for so long Elizabeth Vermont ceased\nto be talked about. It looked as though her story were told. She was a\nchanged woman, and I amused myself with the notion that when she was a\nvery old lady, with many years of perfect respectability behind her, the\npast, the lurid past, would seem to belong not to her but to someone\nlong since dead whom once she had vaguely known. For women have an\nenviable faculty of forgetting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut who can tell what the fates have in store? In the twinkling of an\neye all was changed. Peter Vermont, after ten years of an ideal\nmarriage, fell madly in love with a girl called Barbara Canton. She was\na nice girl, the youngest daughter of Lord Robert Canton who was at one\ntime Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and she was pretty in a fair\nand fluffy way. Of course she was not for a moment to be compared with\nLady Elizabeth. Many people knew what had happened, but no one could\ntell whether Elizabeth Vermont had any inkling of it, and they wondered\nhow she would meet a situation that was so foreign to her experience. It\nwas always she who had discarded her lovers; none had deserted her. For\nmy part I thought she would make short work of little Miss Canton; I\nknew her courage and her adroitness. All this was in my mind now while\nwe chatted over our luncheon. There was nothing in her demeanour, as\ngay, charming and frank as usual, to suggest that anything troubled her.\nShe talked as she always talked, lightly but with good sense and a\nlively perception of the ridiculous, of the various topics which the\ncourse of conversation brought forward. I enjoyed myself. I came to the\nconclusion that by some miracle she had no notion of Peter's changed\nfeelings and I explained this to myself by the supposition that her love\nfor him was so great, she could not conceive that his for her might be\nless.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe drank our coffee and smoked a couple of cigarettes, and she asked me\nthe time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A quarter to three.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must ask for my bill.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Won't you let me stand you lunch?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course,\" she smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you in a hurry?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm meeting Peter at three.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, how is he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's very well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave a little smile, that tardy and delightful smile of hers, but I\nseemed to discern in it a certain mockery. For an instant she hesitated\nand she looked at me with deliberation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You like curious situations, don't you?\" she said. \"You'd never guess\nthe errand I'm bound on. I rang up Peter this morning and asked him to\nmeet me at three. I'm going to ask him to divorce me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not,\" I cried. I felt myself flush and did not know what to say.\n\"I thought you got on so well together.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think it's likely that I shouldn't know what all the world\nknows? I'm really not such a fool as all that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was not a woman to whom it was possible to say what one did not\nbelieve and I could not pretend that I did not know what she meant. I\nremained silent for a second or two.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why should you allow yourself to be divorced?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Robert Canton is a stuffy old thing. I very much doubt if he'd let\nBarbara marry Peter if I divorced him. And for me, you know, it isn't of\nthe smallest consequence: one divorce more or less...\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shrugged her pretty shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How do you know he wants to marry her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's head over ears in love with her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Has he told you so?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. He doesn't even know that I know. He's been so wretched, poor\ndarling. He's been trying so hard not to hurt my feelings.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps it's only a momentary infatuation,\" I hazarded. \"It may pass.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why should it? Barbara's young and pretty. She's quite nice. They're\nvery well suited to one another. And besides, what good would it do if\nit did pass? They love each other now and the present in love is all\nthat matters. I'm nineteen years older than Peter. If a man stops loving\na woman old enough to be his mother do you think he'll ever come to love\nher again? You're a novelist, you must know more about human nature than\nthat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why should you make this sacrifice?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When he asked me to marry him ten years ago I promised him that when he\nwanted his release he should have it. You see, there was so great a\ndisproportion between our ages I thought that was only fair.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And are you going to keep a promise that he hasn't asked you to keep?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave a little flutter of those long thin hands of hers and now I\nfelt that there was something ominous in the dark glitter of that\nemerald.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I must, you know. One must behave like a gentleman. To tell you the\ntruth, that's why I'm lunching here to-day. It was at this table that he\nproposed to me; we were dining together, you know, and I was sitting\njust where I am now. The nuisance is that I'm just as much in love with\nhim now as I was then.\" She paused for a minute and I could see that she\nclenched her teeth. \"Well, I suppose I ought to go. Peter hates one to\nkeep him waiting.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave me a sort of little helpless look and it struck me that she\nsimply could not bring herself to rise from her chair. But she smiled\nand with an abrupt gesture sprang to her feet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would you like me to come with you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As far as the hotel door,\" she smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe walked through the restaurant and the lounge and when we came to the\nentrance a porter swung round the revolving doors. I asked if she would\nlike a taxi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I'd sooner walk, it's such a lovely day.\" She gave me her hand.\n\"It's been so nice to see you. I shall go abroad to-morrow, but I expect\nto be in London all the autumn. Do ring me up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe smiled and nodded and turned away. I watched her walk up Davies\nStreet. The air was still bland and spring-like and above the roofs\nlittle white clouds were sailing leisurely in a blue sky. She held\nherself very erect and the poise of her head was gallant. She was a slim\nand lovely figure so that people looked at her as they passed. I saw her\nbow graciously to some acquaintance who raised his hat, and I thought\nthat never in a thousand years would it occur to him that she had a\nbreaking heart. I repeat, she was a very honest woman.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\n\"What a bit of luck that I'm placed next to you,\" said Laura, as we sat\ndown to dinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For me,\" I replied politely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That remains to be seen. I particularly wanted to have the chance of\ntalking to you. I've got a story to tell you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt this my heart sank a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd sooner you talked about yourself,\" I answered. \"Or even about me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, but I must tell you the story. I think you'll be able to use it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you must, you must. But let's look at the menu first.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you want me to?\" she said, somewhat aggrieved. \"I thought you'd\nbe pleased.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am. You might have written a play and wanted to read me that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It happened to some friends of mine. It's perfectly true.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's no recommendation. A true story is never quite so true as an\ninvented one.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does that mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing very much,\" I admitted. \"But I thought it sounded well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish you'd let me get on with it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm all attention. I'm not going to eat the soup. It's fattening.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave me a pinched look and then glanced at the menu. She uttered a\nlittle sigh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, well, if you're going to deny yourself I suppose I must too. Heaven\nknows, I can't afford to take liberties with my figure.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And yet is there any soup more heavenly than the sort of soup in which\nyou put a great dollop of cream?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bortsch,\" she sighed. \"It's the only soup I really like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never mind. Tell me your story and we'll forget about food till the\nfish comes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I was actually there when it happened. I was dining with the\nLivingstones. Do you know the Livingstones?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I don't think I do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you can ask them and they'll confirm every word I say. They'd\nasked their governess to come in to dinner because some woman had thrown\nthem over at the last moment--you know how inconsiderate people are--and\nthey would have been thirteen at table. Their governess was a Miss\nRobinson, quite a nice girl, young, you know, twenty or twenty-one, and\nrather pretty. Personally I would never engage a governess who was young\nand pretty. One never knows.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But one hopes for the best.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLaura paid no attention to my remark.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The chances are that she'll be thinking of young men instead of\nattending to her duties and then, just when she's got used to your ways,\nshe'll want to go and get married. But Miss Robinson had excellent\nreferences, and I must allow that she was a very nice, respectable\nperson. I believe in point of fact she was a clergyman's daughter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There was a man at dinner whom I don't suppose you've ever heard of,\nbut who's quite a celebrity in his way. He's a Count Borselli and he\nknows more about precious stones than anyone in the world. He was\nsitting next to Mary Lyngate, who rather fancies herself on her pearls,\nand in the course of conversation she asked him what he thought of the\nstring she was wearing. He said it was very pretty. She was rather\npiqued at this and told him it was valued at eight thousand pounds.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Yes, it's worth that,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Miss Robinson was sitting opposite to him. She was looking rather nice\nthat evening. Of course I recognised her dress, it was one of Sophie's\nold ones; but if you hadn't known Miss Robinson was the governess you\nwould never have suspected it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'That's a very beautiful necklace that young lady has on,' said\nBorselli.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, but that's Mrs. Livingstone's governess,' said Mary Lyngate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I can't help that,' he said. 'She's wearing one of the finest strings\nof pearls for its size that I've ever seen in my life. It must be worth\nfifty thousand pounds.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Nonsense.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I give you my word it is.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mary Lyngate leant over. She has rather a shrill voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Miss Robinson, do you know what Count Borselli says?' she exclaimed.\n'He says that string of pearls you're wearing is worth fifty thousand\npounds.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Just at that moment there was a sort of pause in the conversation so\nthat everybody heard. We all turned and looked at Miss Robinson. She\nflushed a little and laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Well, I made a very good bargain,' she said, 'because I paid fifteen\nshillings for it.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You certainly did.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We all laughed. It was of course absurd. We've all heard of wives\npalming off on their husbands as false a string of pearls that was real\nand expensive. That story is as old as the hills.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you,\" I said, thinking of a little narrative of my own.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But it was too ridiculous to suppose that a governess would remain a\ngoverness if she owned a string of pearls worth fifty thousand pounds.\nIt was obvious that the Count had made a bloomer. Then an extraordinary\nthing happened. The long arm of coincidence came in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It shouldn't,\" I retorted. \"It's had too much exercise. Haven't you\nseen that charming book called <i>A Dictionary of English Usage</i>?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish you wouldn't interrupt just when I'm really getting to the\nexciting point.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut I had to do so again, for just then a young grilled salmon was\ninsinuated round my left elbow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Livingstone is giving us a heavenly dinner,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is salmon fattening?\" asked Laura.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very,\" I answered as I took a large helping.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bunk,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go on,\" I begged her. \"The long arm of coincidence was about to make a\ngesture.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, at that very moment the butler bent over Miss Robinson and\nwhispered something in her ear. I thought she turned a trifle pale. It's\nsuch a mistake not to wear rouge; you never know what tricks nature will\nplay on you. She certainly looked startled. She leant forwards.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Mrs. Livingstone, Dawson says there are two men in the hall who want\nto speak to me at once.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Well, you'd better go,' said Sophie Livingstone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Miss Robinson got up and left the room. Of course the same thought\nflashed through all our minds, but I said it first.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I hope they haven't come to arrest her,' I said to Sophie. 'It would\nbe too dreadful for you, my dear.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Are you sure it was a real necklace, Borselli?' she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, quite.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'She could hardly have had the nerve to wear it to-night if it were\nstolen,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sophie Livingstone turned as pale as death under her make-up, and I saw\nshe was wondering if everything was all right in her jewel case. I only\nhad on a little chain of diamonds, but instinctively I put my hand up to\nmy neck to feel if it was still there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Don't talk nonsense,' said Mr. Livingstone. 'How on earth would Miss\nRobinson have had the chance of sneaking a valuable string of pearls?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'She may be a receiver,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, but she had such wonderful references,' said Sophie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'They always do,' I said.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was positively forced to interrupt Laura once more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't seem to have been determined to take a very bright view of\nthe case,\" I remarked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I knew nothing against Miss Robinson, and I had every reason\nto think her a very nice girl, but it would have been rather thrilling\nto find out that she was a notorious thief and a well-known member of a\ngang of international crooks.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Just like a film. I'm dreadfully afraid that it's only in films that\nexciting things like that happen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, we waited in breathless suspense. There was not a sound. I\nexpected to hear a scuffle in the hall or at least a smothered shriek. I\nthought the silence very ominous. Then the door opened and Miss Robinson\nwalked in. I noticed at once that the necklace was gone. I could see\nthat she was pale and excited. She came back to the table, sat down and\nwith a smile threw on it...\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"On what?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"On the table, you fool. A string of pearls.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'There's my necklace,' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Count Borselli leant forwards.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, but those are false,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I told you they were,' she laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'That's not the same string that you had on a few moment ago,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She shook her head and smiled mysteriously. We were all intrigued. I\ndon't know that Sophie Livingstone was so very much pleased at her\ngoverness making herself the centre of interest like that and I thought\nthere was a suspicion of tartness in her manner when she suggested that\nMiss Robinson had better explain. Well, Miss Robinson said that when she\nwent into the hall she found two men who said they'd come from Jarrot's\nStores. She'd bought her string there, as she said, for fifteen\nshillings, and she'd taken it back because the clasp was loose and had\nonly fetched it that afternoon. The men said they had given her the\nwrong string. Someone had left a string of real pearls to be re-strung\nand the assistant had made a mistake. Of course I can't understand how\nanyone could be so stupid as to take a really valuable string to\nJarrot's, they aren't used to dealing with that sort of thing, and they\nwouldn't know real pearls from false; but you know what fools some women\nare. Anyhow, it was the string Miss Robinson was wearing, and it was\nvalued at fifty thousand pounds. She naturally gave it back to them--she\ncouldn't do anything else, I suppose, though it must have been a\nwrench--and they returned her own string to her; then they said that\nalthough of course they were under no obligation--you know the silly,\npompous way men talk when they're trying to be business-like--they were\ninstructed, as a solatium or whatever you call it, to offer her a cheque\nfor three hundred pounds. Miss Robinson actually showed it to us. She\nwas as pleased as Punch.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it was a piece of luck, wasn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd have thought so. As it turned out it was the ruin of her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, how was that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, when the time came for her to go on her holiday she told Sophie\nLivingstone that she'd made up her mind to go to Deauville for a month\nand blue the whole three hundred pounds. Of course Sophie tried to\ndissuade her, and begged her to put the money in the savings bank, but\nshe wouldn't hear of it. She said she'd never had such a chance before\nand would never have it again and she meant for at least four weeks to\nlive like a duchess. Sophie couldn't really do anything and so she gave\nway. She sold Miss Robinson a lot of clothes that she didn't want; she'd\nbeen wearing them all through the season and was sick to death of them;\nshe says she gave them to her, but I don't suppose she quite did that--I\ndare say she sold them very cheap--and Miss Robinson started off,\nentirely alone, for Deauville. What do you think happened then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't a notion,\" I replied. \"I hope she had the time of her life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, a week before she was due to come back she wrote to Sophie and\nsaid that she'd changed her plans and had entered another profession,\nand hoped that Mrs. Livingstone would forgive her if she didn't return.\nOf course poor Sophie was furious. What had actually happened was that\nMiss Robinson had picked up a rich Argentine in Deauville and had gone\noff to Paris with him. She's been in Paris ever since. I've seen her\nmyself at Florence's, with bracelets right up to her elbow and ropes of\npearls round her neck. Of course I cut her dead. They say she has a\nhouse in the Bois de Boulogne and I know she has a Rolls. She threw over\nthe Argentine in a few months and then got hold of a Greek; I don't know\nwho she's with now, but the long and short of it is that she's far and\naway the smartest cocotte in Paris.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When you say she was ruined you use the word in a purely technical\nsense, I conclude,\" said I.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what you mean by that,\" said Laura. \"But don't you think\nyou could make a story out of it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Unfortunately I've already written a story about a pearl necklace. One\ncan't go on writing stories about pearl necklaces.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got half a mind to write it myself. Only, of course, I should\nchange the end.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, how would you end it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I should have had her engaged to a bank clerk who had been badly\nknocked about in the war, with only one leg, say, or half his face shot\naway; and they'd be dreadfully poor and there would be no prospect of\ntheir marriage for years, and he would be putting all his savings into\nbuying a little house in the suburbs, and they'd have arranged to marry\nwhen he had saved the last instalment. And then she takes him the three\nhundred pounds and they can hardly believe it, they're so happy, and he\ncries on her shoulder. He just cries like a child. And they get the\nlittle house in the suburbs and they marry, and they have his old mother\nto live with them, and he goes to the bank every day, and if she's\ncareful not to have babies she can still go out as a daily governess,\nand he's often ill--with his wound, you know--and she nurses him, and\nit's all very pathetic and sweet and lovely.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It sounds rather dull to me,\" I ventured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, but moral,\" said Laura.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThe two prahus were dropping easily down-stream, one a few yards ahead\nof the other, and in the first sat the two white men. After seven weeks\non the rivers they were glad to know that they would lodge that night in\na civilised house. To Izzart, who had been in Borneo since the war, the\nDyak houses and their feasts were of course an old story; but Campion,\nthough new to the country and at first amused by the strangeness,\nhankered too now for chairs to sit on and a bed to sleep in. The Dyaks\nwere hospitable, but no one could say that there was much comfort to be\nfound in their houses, and there was a monotony in the entertainment\nthey offered a guest which presently grew somewhat wearisome. Every\nevening, as the travellers reached the landing-place, the headman,\nbearing a flag, and the more important members of the household came\ndown to the river to fetch them. They were led up to the long-house--a\nvillage really under one roof, built on piles, to which access was\nobtained by climbing up the trunk of a tree rudely notched into\nsteps--and to the beating of drums and gongs walked up and down the\nwhole length of it in long procession. On both sides serried throngs of\nbrown people sat on their haunches and stared silently as the white men\npassed. Clean mats were unrolled and the guests seated themselves. The\nheadman brought a live chicken and, holding it by the legs, waved it\nthree times over their heads, called the spirits loudly to witness and\nuttered an invocation. Then various persons brought eggs. Arak was\ndrunk. A girl, a very small shy thing with the grace of a flower but\nwith something hieratic in her immobile face, held a cup to the white\nman's lips till it was empty and then a great shout arose. The men began\nto dance, one after the other, each treading his little measure, with\nhis shield and his parang, to the accompaniment of drum and gong. After\nthis had gone on for some time the visitors were taken into one of the\nrooms that led off the long platform on which was led the common life of\nthe household and found their supper prepared for them. The girls fed\nthem with Chinese spoons. Then everyone grew a little drunk and they all\ntalked till the early hours of the morning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut now their journey was done and they were on their way to the coast.\nThey had started at dawn. The river then was very shallow and ran clear\nand bright over a shingly bottom; the trees leaned over it so that above\nthere was only a strip of blue sky; but now it had broadened out, and\nthe men were poling no longer but paddling. The trees, bamboos, wild\nsago like huge bunches of ostrich feathers, trees with enormous leaves\nand trees with feathery foliage like the acacia, coconut trees and areca\npalms, with their long straight white stems, the trees on the banks were\nimmensely and violently luxuriant. Here and there, gaunt and naked, was\nthe bare skeleton of a tree struck by lightning or dead of old age, and\nits whiteness against all that green was vivid. Here and there, rival\nkings of the forest, tall trees soared above the common level of the\njungle. Then there were the parasites; in the fork of two branches great\ntufts of lush green leaves, or flowering creepers that covered the\nspreading foliage like a bride's veil; sometimes they wound round a tall\ntrunk, a sheath of splendour, and threw long flowering arms from branch\nto branch. There was something thrilling in the passionate wildness of\nthat eager growth; it had the daring abandon of the nomad rioting in the\ntrain of the god.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe day wore on, and now the heat was no longer so oppressive. Campion\nlooked at the shabby silver watch on his wrist. It could not be long now\nbefore they reached their destination.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What sort of a chap is Hutchinson?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know him. I believe he's a very good sort.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHutchinson was the Resident in whose house they were to spend the night,\nand they had sent on a Dyak in a canoe to announce their arrival.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I hope he's got some whisky. I've drunk enough arak to last me a\nlifetime.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCampion was a mining engineer whom the Sultan on his way to England had\nmet at Singapore, and finding him at a loose end had commissioned to go\nto Sembulu and see whether he could discover any mineral which might be\nprofitably worked. He sent Willis, the Resident at Kuala Solor,\ninstructions to afford him every facility, and Willis had put him in the\ncare of Izzart because Izzart spoke both Malay and Dyak like a native.\nThis was the third trip they had made into the interior, and now Campion\nwas to go home with his reports. They were to catch the <i>Sultan Ahmed</i>,\nwhich was due to pass the mouth of the river at dawn on the next day but\none, and with any luck should reach Kuala Solor on the same afternoon.\nThey were both glad to get back to it. There was tennis and golf there,\nand the club with its billiard tables, food which was relatively good,\nand the comforts of civilisation. Izzart was glad, too, that he would\nhave other society than Campion's. He gave him a sidelong glance. He was\na little man with a big, bald head, and though certainly fifty, strong\nand wiry; he had quick, shining blue eyes and a stubbly, grey moustache.\nHe was seldom without an old briar pipe between his broken and\ndiscoloured teeth. He was neither clean nor neat, his khaki shorts were\nragged and his singlet torn; he was wearing now a battered topee. He had\nknocked about the world since he was eighteen and had been in South\nAfrica, in China and in Mexico. He was good company; he could tell a\nstory well, and he was prepared to drink and drink again with anyone he\nmet. They had got on very well together, but Izzart had never felt quite\nat home with him. Though they joked and laughed together, got drunk\ntogether, Izzart felt that there was no intimacy between them: for all\nthe cordiality of their relations they remained nothing but\nacquaintances. He was very sensitive to the impression he made on\nothers, and behind Campion's joviality he had felt a certain coolness;\nthose shining blue eyes had summed him up; and it vaguely irritated\nIzzart that Campion had formed an opinion of him, and he did not quite\nknow what it was. He was exasperated by the possibility that this common\nlittle man did not think entirely well of him. He desired to be liked\nand admired. He wanted to be popular. He wished the people he met to\ntake an inordinate fancy to him, so that he could either reject them or\na trifle condescendingly bestow his friendship on them. His inclination\nwas to be familiar with all and sundry, but he was held back by the fear\nof a rebuff; sometimes he had been uneasily conscious that his\neffusiveness surprised the persons he lavished it on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBy some chance he had never met Hutchinson, though of course he knew all\nabout him just as Hutchinson knew all about him, and they would have\nmany common friends to talk of. Hutchinson had been at Winchester, and\nIzzart was glad that he could tell him that he had been at Harrow....\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe prahu rounded a bend in the river and suddenly, standing on a slight\neminence, they saw the bungalow. In a few minutes they caught sight of\nthe landing-stage and on it, among a little group of natives, a figure\nin white waving to them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHutchinson was a tall, stout man with a red face. His appearance led you\nto expect that he was breezy and self-confident, so that it was not a\nlittle surprising to discover quickly that he was diffident and even a\ntrifle shy. When he shook hands with his guests--Izzart introduced\nhimself and then Campion--and led them up the pathway to the bungalow,\nthough he was plainly anxious to be civil it was not hard to see that he\nfound it difficult to make conversation. He took them out on to the\nverandah and here they found on the table glasses and whisky and soda.\nThey made themselves comfortable on long chairs. Izzart, conscious of\nHutchinson's slight embarrassment with strangers, expanded; he was very\nhearty and voluble. He began to speak of their common acquaintances at\nKuala Solor, and he managed very soon to slip in casually the\ninformation that he had been at Harrow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You were at Winchester, weren't you?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder if you knew George Parker. He was in my regiment. He was at\nWinchester. I daresay he was younger than you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart felt that it was a bond between them that they had been at these\nparticular schools, and it excluded Campion, who obviously had enjoyed\nno such advantage. They drank two or three whiskies. Izzart in half an\nhour began to call his host Hutchie. He talked a good deal about \"my\nregiment\" in which he had got his company during the war, and what good\nfellows his brother officers were. He mentioned two or three names which\ncould hardly be unknown to Hutchinson. They were not the sort of people\nthat Campion was likely to have come across, and he was not sorry to\nadminister to him a neat snub when he claimed acquaintance with someone\nhe spoke of.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Billie Meadows? I knew a fellow called Billie Meadows in Sinaloa many\nyears ago,\" said Campion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I shouldn't think it could be the same,\" said Izzart, with a smile.\n\"Billie's by way of being a peer of the realm. He's the Lord Meadows who\nraces. Don't you remember, he owned Spring Carrots?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDinner time was approaching, and after a wash and brush-up they drank a\ncouple of gin pahits. They sat down. Hutchinson had not been to Kuala\nSolor for the best part of a year, and had not seen another white man\nfor three months. He was anxious to make the most of his visitors. He\ncould give them no wine, but there was plenty of whisky and after dinner\nhe brought out a precious bottle of Benedictine. They were very gay.\nThey laughed and talked a great deal. Izzart was getting on famously. He\nthought he had never liked a fellow more than Hutchinson, and he pressed\nhim to come down to Kuala Solor as soon as he could. They would have a\nwonderful beano. Campion was left out of the conversation by Izzart with\nthe faintly malicious intention of putting him in his place, and by\nHutchinson through shyness; and presently, after yawning a good deal, he\nsaid he would go to bed. Hutchinson showed him to his room and when he\nreturned Izzart said to him:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't want to turn in yet, do you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not on your life. Let's have another drink.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey sat and talked. They both grew a little drunk. Presently Hutchinson\ntold Izzart that he lived with a Malay girl, and had a couple of\nchildren by her. He had told them to keep out of sight while Campion was\nthere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I expect she's asleep now,\" said Hutchinson, with a glance at the door\nwhich Izzart knew led into his room, \"but I'd like you to see the\nkiddies in the morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJust then a faint wail was heard and Hutchinson with a \"Hulloa, the\nlittle devil's awake,\" went to the door and opened it. In a moment or\ntwo he came out of the room with a child in his arms. A woman followed\nhim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's cutting his teeth,\" said Hutchinson. \"It makes him restless.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe woman wore a sarong and a thin white jacket and she was barefoot.\nShe was young, with fine dark eyes, and she gave Izzart when he spoke to\nher a bright and pleasant smile. She sat down and lit a cigarette. She\nanswered the civil questions Izzart put to her without embarrassment,\nbut also without effusion. Hutchinson asked her if she would have a\nwhisky and soda, but she refused. When the two men began to talk again\nin English she sat on quite quietly, faintly rocking herself in her\nchair, and occupied with none could tell what calm thoughts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's a very good girl,\" said Hutchinson. \"She looks after the house\nand she's no trouble. Of course it's the only thing to do in a place\nlike this.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall never do it myself,\" said Izzart. \"After all, one may want to\nget married and then it means all sorts of botherations.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But who wants to get married? What a life for a white woman. I wouldn't\nask a white woman to live here for anything in the world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course it's a matter of taste. If I have any kiddies I'm going to\nsee that they have a white mother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHutchinson looked down at the little dark-skinned child he held in his\narms. He gave a faint smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's funny how you get to like them,\" he said. \"When they're your own\nit doesn't seem to matter that they've got a touch of the tar-brush.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe woman gave the child a look, and getting up said she would take it\nback to bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should think we'd better all turn in,\" said Hutchinson. \"God knows\nwhat the time is.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart went to his room and threw open the shutters which his boy\nHassan, whom he was travelling with, had closed. Blowing out the candle\nso that it should not attract the mosquitoes, he sat down at the window\nand looked at the soft night. The whisky he had drunk made him feel very\nwide awake, and he was not inclined to go to bed. He took off his ducks,\nput on a sarong and lit a cheroot. His good-humour was gone. It was the\nsight of Hutchinson looking fondly at the half-caste child which had\nupset him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They've got no right to have them,\" he said to himself. \"They've got no\nchance in the world. Ever.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe passed his hands reflectively along his bare and hairy legs. He\nshuddered a little. Though he had done everything he could to develop\nthe calves, his legs were like broomsticks. He hated them. He was\nuneasily conscious of them all the time. They were like a native's. Of\ncourse they were the very legs for a top-boot. In his uniform he had\nlooked very well. He was a tall, powerful man, over six feet high, and\nhe had a neat black moustache and neat black hair. His dark eyes were\nfine and mobile. He was a good-looking fellow and he knew it, and he\ndressed well, shabbily when shabbiness was good form, and smartly when\nthe occasion demanded. He had loved the army, and it was a bitter blow\nto him when, at the end of the war, he could not remain in it. His\nambitions were simple. He wanted to have two thousand a year, give smart\nlittle dinners, go to parties and wear a uniform. He hankered after\nLondon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course his mother lived there, and his mother cramped his style. He\nwondered how on earth he could produce her if ever he got engaged to the\ngirl of good family (with a little money) whom he was looking for to\nmake his wife. Because his father had been dead so long and during the\nlater part of his career was stationed in the most remote of the Malay\nStates, Izzart felt fairly sure that no one in Sembulu knew anything\nabout her, but he lived in terror lest someone, running across her in\nLondon, should write over to tell people that she was a half-caste. She\nhad been a beautiful creature when Izzart's father, an engineer in the\ngovernment service, had married her; but now she was a fat old woman\nwith grey hair who sat about all day smoking cigarettes. Izzart was\ntwelve years old when his father died and then he could speak Malay much\nmore fluently than English. An aunt offered to pay for his education and\nMrs. Izzart accompanied her son to England. She lived habitually in\nfurnished apartments, and her rooms with their Oriental draperies and\nMalay silver were overheated and stuffy. She was for ever in trouble\nwith her landladies because she would leave cigarette-ends about. Izzart\nhated the way she made friends with them: she would be shockingly\nfamiliar with them for a time, then there would be a falling-out, and\nafter a violent scene she would flounce out of the house. Her only\namusement was the pictures, and to these she went every day in the week.\nAt home she wore an old and tawdry dressing-gown, but when she went out\nshe dressed herself--but, oh, how untidily--in extravagant colours, so\nthat it was a mortification to her dapper son. He quarrelled with her\nfrequently, she made him impatient and he was ashamed of her; and yet he\nfelt for her a deep tenderness; it was almost a physical bond between\nthem, something stronger than the ordinary feeling of mother and son, so\nthat notwithstanding the failings that exasperated him she was the only\nperson in the world with whom he felt entirely at home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was owing to his father's position and his own knowledge of Malay,\nfor his mother always spoke it to him, that after the war, finding\nhimself with nothing to do, he had managed to enter the service of the\nSultan of Sembulu. He had been a success. He played games well, he was\nstrong and a good athlete; in the rest-house at Kuala Solor were the\ncups which he had won at Harrow for running and jumping, and to these he\nhad added since others for golf and tennis. With his abundant fund of\nsmall-talk he was an asset at parties and his cheeriness made things go.\nHe ought to have been happy and he was wretched. He wanted so much to be\npopular, and he had an impression, stronger than ever at this moment,\nthat popularity escaped him. He wondered whether by any chance the men\nat Kuala Solor with whom he was so hail-fellow-well-met suspected that\nhe had native blood in him. He knew very well what to expect if they\never found out. They wouldn't say he was gay and friendly then, they\nwould say he was damned familiar; and they would say he was inefficient\nand careless, as the half-castes were, and when he talked of marrying a\nwhite woman they would snigger. Oh, it was so unfair! What difference\ncould it make, that drop of native blood in his veins, and yet because\nof it they would always be on the watch for the expected failure at the\ncritical moment. Everyone knew that you couldn't rely on Eurasians,\nsooner or later they would let you down; he knew it too, but now he\nasked himself whether they didn't fail because failure was expected of\nthem. They were never given a chance, poor devils.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut a cock crew loudly. It must be very late and he was beginning to\nfeel chilly. He got into bed. When Hassan brought him his tea next\nmorning he had a racking headache, and when he went in to breakfast he\ncould not look at the porridge and the bacon and eggs which were set\nbefore him. Hutchinson too was feeling none too well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I fancy we made rather a night of it,\" said his host, with a smile to\nconceal his faint embarrassment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I feel like hell,\" said Izzart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going to breakfast off a whisky and soda myself,\" added Hutchinson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart asked for nothing better, and it was with distaste that they\nwatched Campion eat with healthy appetite a substantial meal. Campion\nchaffed them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By God, Izzart, you're looking green about the gills,\" he said. \"I\nnever saw such a filthy colour.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart flushed. His swarthiness was always a sensitive point with him.\nBut he forced himself to give a cheery laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see, I had a Spanish grandmother,\" he answered, \"and when I'm under\nthe weather it always come out. I remember at Harrow I fought a boy and\nlicked him, because he called me a damned half-caste.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are dark,\" said Hutchinson. \"Do Malays ever ask you if you have any\nnative blood in you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, damn their impudence.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA boat with their kit had started early in the morning in order to get\nto the mouth of the river before them, and tell the skipper of the\n<i>Sultan Ahmed</i>, if by chance he arrived before he was due, that they\nwere on their way. Campion and Izzart were to set out immediately after\ntiffin in order to arrive at the place where they were to spend the\nnight before the Bore passed. A Bore is a tidal wave that, by reason of\na peculiarity in the lie of the land, surges up certain rivers, and\nthere happened to be one on the river on which they were travelling.\nHutchinson had talked to them of it the night before and Campion, who\nhad never seen such a thing, was much interested.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is one of the best in Borneo. It's worth looking at,\" said\nHutchinson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe told them how the natives, waiting the moment, rode it and were borne\nup the river on its crest at a breathless and terrifying speed. He had\ndone it once himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never no more for me,\" he said. \"I was scared out of my wits.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should like to try it once,\" said Izzart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's exciting enough, but my word, when you're in a flimsy dug-out and\nyou know that if the native doesn't get the right moment you'll be flung\nin that seething torrent and you won't have a chance in a million...\nno, it's not my idea of sport.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've shot a good many rapids in my day,\" said Campion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Rapids be damned. You wait till you see the Bore. It's one of the most\nterrifying things I know. D'you know that at least a dozen natives are\ndrowned in it in this river alone every year?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey lounged about on the verandah most of the morning and Hutchinson\nshowed them the court-house. Then gin pahits were served. They drank two\nor three. Izzart began to feel himself, and when at length tiffin was\nready he found that he had an excellent appetite. Hutchinson had boasted\nof his Malay curry and when the steaming, succulent dishes were placed\nbefore them they all set to ravenously. Hutchinson pressed them to\ndrink.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got nothing to do but sleep. Why shouldn't you get drunk?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe could not bear to let them go so soon, it was good after so long to\nhave white men to talk to, and he lingered over the meal. He urged them\nto eat. They would have a filthy meal that night at the long-house and\nnothing to drink but arak. They had better make hay while the sun shone.\nCampion suggested once or twice that they should start, but Hutchinson,\nand Izzart too, for now he was feeling very happy and comfortable,\nassured him there was plenty of time. Hutchinson sent for his precious\nbottle of Benedictine. They had made a hole in it last night; they might\nas well finish it before they went.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen at last he walked down with them to the river they were all very\nmerry and none of them was quite steady on his legs. Over the middle of\nthe boat was an attap awning, and under this Hutchinson had had a\nmattress laid. The crew were prisoners who had been marched down from\nthe jail to row the white men, and they wore dingy sarongs with the\nprison mark. They waited at their oars. Izzart and Campion shook hands\nwith Hutchinson and threw themselves down on the mattress. The boat\npushed off. The turbid river, wide and placid, glistened in the heat of\nthat brilliant afternoon like polished brass. In the distance ahead of\nthem they could see the bank with its tangle of green trees. They felt\ndrowsy, but Izzart at least found a curious enjoyment in resisting for a\nlittle while the heaviness that was creeping over him, and he made up\nhis mind that he would not let himself fall asleep till he had finished\nhis cheroot. At last the stub began to burn his fingers and he flung it\ninto the river.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going to have a wonderful snooze,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What about the Bore?\" asked Campion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, that's all right. We needn't worry about that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave a long and noisy yawn. His limbs felt like lead. He had one\nmoment in which he was conscious of his delicious drowsiness and then he\nknew nothing more. Suddenly he was awakened by Campion shaking him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, what's that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's what?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe spoke irritably, for sleep was still heavy upon him, but with his\neyes he followed Campion's gesture. He could hear nothing, but a good\nway off he saw two or three white-crested waves following one another.\nThey did not look very alarming.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I suppose that's the Bore.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are we going to do about it?\" cried Campion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart was scarcely yet quite awake. He smiled at the concern in\nCampion's voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't worry. These fellows know all about it. They know exactly what to\ndo. We may get a bit splashed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut while they were saying these few words the Bore came nearer, very\nquickly, with a roar like the roar of an angry sea, and Izzart saw that\nthe waves were much higher than he had thought. He did not like the look\nof them and he tightened his belt so that his shorts should not slip\ndown if the boat were upset. In a moment the waves were upon them. It\nwas a great wall of water that seemed to tower over them, and it might\nhave been ten or twelve feet high, but you could measure it only with\nyour horror. It was quite plain that no boat could weather it. The first\nwave dashed over them, drenching them all, half filling the boat with\nwater, and then immediately another wave struck them. The boatmen began\nto shout. They pulled madly at their oars and the steersman yelled an\norder. But in that surging torrent they were helpless, and it was\nfrightening to see how soon they lost all control of the boat. The force\nof the water turned it broadside on and it was carried along, helter\nskelter, upon the crest of the Bore. Another great wave dashed over them\nand the boat began to sink. Izzart and Campion scrambled out of the\ncovered place in which they had been lying and suddenly the boat gave\nway under their feet and they found themselves struggling in the water.\nIt surged and stormed around them. Izzart's first impulse was to swim\nfor the shore, but his boy, Hassan, shouted to him to cling to the boat.\nFor a minute or two they all did this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you all right?\" Campion shouted to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, enjoying the bath,\" said Izzart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe imagined that the waves would pass by as the Bore ascended the river,\nand in a few minutes at the outside they would find themselves in calm\nwater once more. He forgot that they were being carried along on its\ncrest. The waves dashed over them. They clung to the gunwale and the\nbase of the structure which supported the attap awning. Then a larger\nwave caught the boat and it turned over, falling upon them so that they\nlost their hold; there seemed nothing but a slippery bottom to cling to\nand Izzart's hands slithered helplessly on the greasy surface. But the\nboat continued to turn and he made a desperate grab at the gunwale, only\nto feel it slip out of his hands as the turn went on, then he caught the\nframework of the awning, and still it turned, turned slowly right round\nand once more he sought for a hand-hold on the bottom. The boat went\nround and round with a horrible regularity. He thought this must be\nbecause everyone was clinging to one side of it, and he tried to make\nthe crew go round to the other. He could not make them understand.\nEveryone was shouting and the waves beat against them with a dull and\nangry roar. Each time the boat rolled over on them Izzart was pushed\nunder water, only to come up again as the gunwale and the framework of\nthe awning gave him something to cling to. The struggle was awful.\nPresently he began to get terribly out of breath, and he felt his\nstrength leaving him. He knew that he could not hold on much longer, but\nhe did not feel frightened, for his fatigue by now was so great that he\ndid not very much care what happened. Hassan was by his side and he told\nhim he was growing very tired. He thought the best thing was to make a\ndash for the shore, it did not look more than sixty yards away, but\nHassan begged him not to. Still they were being carried along amid those\nseething, pounding waves. The boat went round and round and they\nscrambled over it like squirrels in a cage. Izzart swallowed a lot of\nwater. He felt he was very nearly done. Hassan could not help him, but\nit was a comfort that he was there, for Izzart knew that his boy, used\nto the water all his life, was a powerful swimmer. Then, Izzart did not\nknow why, for a minute or two the boat held bottom downwards, so that he\nwas able to hold on to the gunwale. It was a precious thing to be able\nto get his breath. At that moment two dug-outs, with Malays in them\nriding the Bore, passed swiftly by them. They shouted for help, but the\nMalays averted their faces and went on. They saw the white men, and did\nnot want to be concerned in any trouble that might befall them. It was\nagonising to see them go past, callous and indifferent in their safety.\nBut on a sudden the boat rolled round again, round and round, slowly,\nand the miserable, exhausting scramble repeated itself. It took the\nheart out of you. But the short respite had helped Izzart, and he was\nable to struggle a little longer. Then once more he found himself so\nterribly out of breath that he thought his chest would burst. His\nstrength was all gone, and he did not know now whether he had enough to\ntry to swim for the shore. Suddenly he heard a cry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Izzart, Izzart. Help. Help.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was Campion's voice. It was a scream of agony. It sent a shock all\nthrough Izzart's nerves. Campion, Campion, what did he care for Campion?\nFear seized him, a blind animal fear, and it gave him a new strength. He\ndid not answer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Help me, quick, quick,\" he said to Hassan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHassan understood him at once. By a miracle one of the oars was floating\nquite close to them and he pushed it into Izzart's reach. He placed a\nhand under Izzart's arm and they struck away from the boat. Izzart's\nheart was pounding and his breath came with difficulty. He felt horribly\nweak. The waves beat in his face. The bank looked dreadfully far away.\nHe did not think he could ever reach it. Suddenly the boy cried that he\ncould touch bottom and Izzart put down his legs; but he could feel\nnothing; he swam a few more exhausted strokes, his eyes fixed on the\nbank, and then, trying again, felt his feet sink into thick mud. He was\nthankful. He floundered on and there was the bank within reach of his\nhands, black mud in which he sank to his knees: he scrambled up,\ndesperate to get out of the cruel water, and when he came to the top he\nfound a little flat with tall rank grass all about it. He and Hassan\nsank down on it and lay for a while stretched out like dead men. They\nwere so tired that they could not move. They were covered with black mud\nfrom head to foot.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut presently Izzart's mind began to work, and a pang of anguish on a\nsudden shook him. Campion was drowned. It was awful. He did not know how\nhe was going to explain the disaster when he got back to Kuala Solor.\nThey would blame him for it; he ought to have remembered the Bore and\ntold the steersman to make for the bank and tie up the boat when he saw\nit coming. It wasn't his fault, it was the steersman's, he knew the\nriver; why in God's name hadn't he had the sense to get into safety? How\ncould he have expected that it was possible to ride that horrible\ntorrent? Izzart's limbs shook as he remembered the wall of seething\nwater that rushed down upon them. He must get the body and take it back\nto Kuala Solor. He wondered whether any of the crew were drowned too. He\nfelt too weak to move, but Hassan now rose and wrang the water out of\nhis sarong; he looked over the river and quickly turned to Izzart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tuan, a boat is coming.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe lalang grass prevented Izzart from seeing anything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shout to them,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHassan slipped out of view and made his way along the branch of a tree\nthat overhung the water; he cried out and waved. Presently Izzart heard\nvoices. There was a rapid conversation between the boy and the occupants\nof the boat, and then the boy came back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They saw us capsize, Tuan,\" he said, \"and they came as soon as the Bore\npassed. There's a long-house on the other side. If you will cross the\nriver they will give us sarongs and food and we can sleep there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart for a moment felt that he could not again trust himself on the\nface of the treacherous water.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What about the other tuan?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They do not know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If he's drowned they must find the body.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Another boat has gone up-stream.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart did not know what to do. He was numb. Hassan put his arm round\nhis shoulder and raised him to his feet. He made his way through the\nthick grass to the edge of the water, and there he saw a dug-out with\ntwo Dyaks in it. The river now once more was calm and sluggish; the\ngreat wave had passed on and no one would have dreamed that so short a\nwhile before the placid surface was like a stormy sea. The Dyaks\nrepeated to him what they had already told the boy. Izzart could not\nbring himself to speak. He felt that if he said a word he would burst\nout crying. Hassan helped him to get in, and the Dyaks began to pull\nacross. He fearfully wanted something to smoke, but his cigarettes and\nhis matches, both in a hip-pocket, were soaking. The passage of the\nriver seemed endless. The night fell and when they reached the bank the\nfirst stars were shining. He stepped ashore and one of the Dyaks took\nhim up to the long-house. But Hassan seized the paddle he had dropped\nand with the other pushed out into the stream. Two or three men and some\nchildren came down to meet Izzart and he climbed to the house amid a\nbabel of conversation. He went up the ladder and was led with greetings\nand excited comment to the space where the young men slept. Rattan mats\nwere hurriedly laid to make him a couch and he sank down on them.\nSomeone brought him a jar of arak and he took a long drink; it was rough\nand fiery, burning his throat, but it warmed his heart. He slipped off\nhis shirt and trousers and put on a dry sarong which someone lent him.\nBy chance he caught sight of the yellow new moon lying on her back, and\nit gave him a keen, almost a sensual, pleasure. He could not help\nthinking that he might at that moment be a corpse floating up the river\nwith the tide. The moon had never looked to him more lovely. He began to\nfeel hungry and he asked for rice. One of the women went into a room to\nprepare it. He was more himself now, and he began to think again of the\nexplanations he would make at Kuala Solor. No one could really blame him\nbecause he had gone to sleep; he certainly wasn't drunk, Hutchinson\nwould bear him out there, and how was he to suspect that the steersman\nwould be such a damned fool? It was just rotten luck. But he couldn't\nthink of Campion without a shudder. At last a platter of rice was\nbrought him, and he was just about to start eating when a man ran\nhurriedly along and came up to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The tuan's come,\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What tuan?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe jumped up. There was a commotion about the doorway and he stepped\nforward. Hassan was coming quickly towards him out of the darkness, and\nthen he heard a voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Izzart. Are you there?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCampion advanced towards him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, here we are again. By God, that was a pretty near thing, wasn't\nit? You seem to have made yourself nice and comfortable. My heavens, I\ncould do with a drink.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis dank clothes clung round him, and he was muddy and dishevelled. But\nhe was in excellent spirits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know where the hell they were bringing me. I'd made up my mind\nthat I should have to spend the night on the bank. I thought you were\ndrowned.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Here's some arak,\" said Izzart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCampion put his mouth to the jar and drank and spluttered and drank\nagain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Muck, but by God it's strong.\" He looked at Izzart with a grin of his\nbroken and discoloured teeth. \"I say, old man, you look as though you'd\nbe all the better for a wash.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll wash later.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right, so will I. Tell them to get me a sarong. How did you get\nout?\" He did not wait for an answer. \"I thought I was done for. I owe my\nlife to these two sportsmen here.\" He indicated with a cheery nod two of\nthe Dyak prisoners whom Izzart vaguely recognised as having been part of\ntheir crew. \"They were hanging on to that blasted boat on each side of\nme and somehow they cottoned on to it that I was down and out. I\ncouldn't have lasted another minute. They made signs to me that we could\nrisk having a shot at getting to the bank, but I didn't think I had the\nstrength. By George, I've never been so blown in all my life. I don't\nknow how they managed it, but somehow they got hold of the mattress we'd\nbeen lying on, and they made it into a roll. They're sportsmen they are.\nI don't know why they didn't just save themselves without bothering\nabout me. They gave it to me. I thought it a damned poor lifebelt, but I\nsaw the force of the proverb about a drowning man clutching at a straw.\nI caught hold of the damned thing and between them somehow or other they\ndragged me ashore.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe danger from which he had escaped made Campion excited and voluble;\nbut Izzart hardly listened to what he said. He heard once more, as\ndistinctly as though the words rang now through the air, Campion's\nagonised cry for help, and he felt sick with terror. The blind panic\nraced down his nerves. Campion was talking still, but was he talking to\nconceal his thoughts? Izzart looked into those bright blue eyes and\nsought to read the sense behind the flow of words. Was there a hard\nglint in them or something of cynical mockery? Did he know that Izzart,\nleaving him to his fate, had cut and run? He flushed deeply. After all,\nwhat was there that he could have done? At such a moment it was each for\nhimself and the devil take the hindmost. But what would they say in\nKuala Solor if Campion told them that Izzart had deserted him? He ought\nto have stayed, he wished now with all his heart that he had, but then,\nthen it was stronger than himself, he couldn't. Could anyone blame him?\nNo one who had seen that fierce and seething torrent. Oh, the water and\nthe exhaustion, so that he could have cried!\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you're as hungry as I am you'd better have a tuck in at this rice,\"\nhe said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCampion ate voraciously, but when Izzart had taken a mouthful or two he\nfound that he had no appetite. Campion talked and talked. Izzart\nlistened suspiciously. He felt that he must be alert and he drank more\narak. He began to feel a little drunk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall get into the devil of a row at K. S.,\" he said tentatively.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know why.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was told off to look after you. They won't think it was very clever\nof me to let you get nearly drowned.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It wasn't your fault. It was the fault of the damned fool of a\nsteersman. After all, the important thing is that we're saved. By\nGeorge, I thought I was finished once. I shouted out to you. I don't\nknow if you heard me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I didn't hear anything. There was such a devil of a row, wasn't\nthere?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps you'd got away before. I don't know exactly when you did get\naway.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart looked at him sharply. Was it his fancy that there was an odd\nlook in Campion's eyes?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There was such an awful confusion,\" he said. \"I was just about down and\nout. My boy threw me over an oar. He gave me to understand you were all\nright. He told me you'd got ashore.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe oar! He ought to have given Campion the oar and told Hassan, the\nstrong swimmer, to give <i>him</i> his help. Was it his fancy again that\nCampion gave him a quick and searching glance?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish I could have been of more use to you,\" said Izzart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I'm sure you had enough to do to look after yourself,\" answered\nCampion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe headman brought them cups of arak, and they both drank a great deal.\nIzzart's head began to spin and he suggested that they should turn in.\nBeds had been prepared for them and mosquito nets fixed. They were to\nset out at dawn on the rest of their journey down the river. Campion's\nbed was next to his, and in a few minutes he heard him snoring. He had\nfallen asleep the moment he lay down. The young men of the long-house\nand the prisoners of the boat's crew went on talking late into the night\nIzzart's head now was aching horribly and he could not think. When\nHassan roused him as day broke it seemed to him that he had not slept at\nall. Their clothes had been washed and dried, but they were bedraggled\nobjects as they walked along the narrow pathway to the river where the\nprahu was waiting for them. They rowed leisurely. The morning was lovely\nand the great stretch of placid water gleamed in the early light.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By George, it's fine to be alive,\" said Campion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was grubby and unshaved. He took long breaths, and his twisted mouth\nwas half open with a grin. You could tell that he found the air\nsingularly good to breathe. He was delighted with the blue sky and the\nsunshine and the greenness of the trees. Izzart hated him. He was sure\nthat this morning there was a difference in his manner. He did not know\nwhat to do. He had a mind to throw himself on his mercy. He had behaved\nlike a cad, but he was sorry, he would give anything to have the chance\nagain, but anyone might have done what he did, and if Campion gave him\naway he was ruined. He could never stay in Sembulu; his name would be\nmud in Borneo and the Straits Settlements. If he made his confession to\nCampion he could surely get Campion to promise to hold his tongue. But\nwould he keep his promise? He looked at him, a shifty little man: how\ncould he be relied on? Izzart thought of what he had said the night\nbefore. It wasn't the truth, of course, but who could know that? At all\nevents who could prove that he hadn't honestly thought that Campion was\nsafe? Whatever Campion said, it was only his word against Izzart's; he\ncould laugh and shrug his shoulders and say that Campion had lost his\nhead and didn't know what he was talking about. Besides, it wasn't\ncertain that Campion hadn't accepted his story; in that frightful\nstruggle for life he could be very sure of nothing. He had a temptation\nto go back to the subject, but was afraid if he did that he would excite\nsuspicion in Campion's mind. He <i>must</i> hold his tongue. That was his\nonly chance of safety. And when they got to K. S. he would get in his\nstory first.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should be completely happy now,\" said Campion, \"if I only had\nsomething to smoke.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We shall be able to get some stinkers on board.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCampion gave a little laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Human beings are very unreasonable,\" he said. \"At the first moment I\nwas so glad to be alive that I thought of nothing else, but now I'm\nbeginning to regret the loss of my notes and my photographs and my\nshaving tackle.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart formulated the thought which had lurked at the back of his mind,\nbut which all through the night he had refused to admit into his\nconsciousness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish to God he'd been drowned. Then I'd have been safe.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There she is,\" cried Campion suddenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart looked round. They were at the mouth of the river and there was\nthe <i>Sultan Ahmed</i> waiting for them. Izzart's heart sank: he had\nforgotten that she had an English skipper and that he would have to be\ntold the story of their adventure. What would Campion say? The skipper\nwas called Bredon, and Izzart had met him often at Kuala Solor. He was a\nlittle bluff man, with a black moustache, and a breezy manner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hurry up,\" he called out to them, as they rowed up, \"I've been waiting\nfor you since dawn.\" But when they climbed on board his face fell.\n\"Hulloa, what's the matter with you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give us a drink and you shall hear all about it,\" said Campion, with\nhis crooked grin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come along.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey sat down under the awning. On a table were glasses, a bottle of\nwhisky and soda-water. The skipper gave an order and in a few minutes\nthey were noisily under way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We were caught in the Bore,\" said Izzart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe felt he must say something. His mouth was horribly dry\nnotwithstanding the drink.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Were you, by Jove? You're lucky not to have been drowned. What\nhappened?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe addressed himself to Izzart because he knew him, but it was Campion\nwho answered. He related the whole incident, accurately, and Izzart\nlistened with strained attention. Campion spoke in the plural when he\ntold the early part of the story, and then, as he came to the moment\nwhen they were thrown into the water, changed to the singular. At first\nit was what <i>they</i> had done and now it was what happened to <i>him</i>. He\nleft Izzart out of it. Izzart did not know whether to be relieved or\nalarmed. Why did he not mention him? Was it because in that mortal\nstruggle for life he had thought of nothing but himself or--did he\n<i>know</i>?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what happened to you?\" said Captain Bredon, turning to Izzart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart was about to answer when Campion spoke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Until I got over to the other side of the river I thought he was\ndrowned. I don't know how he got out. I expect he hardly knows himself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was touch and go,\" said Izzart with a laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhy had Campion said that? He caught his eye. He was sure now that there\nwas a gleam of amusement in it. It was awful not to be certain. He was\nfrightened. He was ashamed. He wondered if he could not so guide the\nconversation, either now or later, as to ask Campion whether that was\nthe story he was going to tell in Kuala Solor. There was nothing in it\nto excite anyone's suspicions. But if nobody else knew, Campion knew. He\ncould have killed him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I think you're both of you damned lucky to be alive,\" said the\nskipper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was but a short run to Kuala Solor, and as they steamed up the\nSembulu river Izzart moodily watched the banks. On each side were the\nmangroves and the nipahs washed by the water, and behind, the dense\ngreen of the jungle; here and there, among fruit trees, were Malay\nhouses on piles. Night fell as they docked. Goring, of the police, came\non board and shook hands with them. He was living at the rest-house just\nthen, and as he set about his work of seeing the native passengers he\ntold them they would find another man, Porter by name, staying there\ntoo. They would all meet at dinner. The boys took charge of their kit,\nand Campion and Izzart strolled along. They bathed and changed, and at\nhalf-past eight the four of them assembled in the common-room for gin\npahits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, what's this Bredon tells me about your being nearly drowned?\"\nsaid Goring as he came in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart felt himself flush, but before he could answer Campion broke in,\nand it seemed certain to Izzart that he spoke in order to give the story\nas he chose. He felt hot with shame. Not a word was spoken in\ndisparagement of him, not a word was said of him at all; he wondered if\nthose two men who listened, Goring and Porter, thought it strange that\nhe should be left out. He looked at Campion intently as he proceeded\nwith his narration; he told it rather humorously; he did not disguise\nthe danger in which they had been, but he made a joke of it, so that the\ntwo listeners laughed at the quandary in which they found themselves.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A thing that's tickled me since,\" said Campion, \"is that when I got\nover to the other bank I was black with mud from head to foot. I felt I\nreally ought to jump in the river and have a wash, but you know I felt\nI'd been in that damned river as much as ever I wanted, and I said to\nmyself: No, by George, I'll go dirty. And when I got into the long-house\nand saw Izzart as black as I was, I knew he'd felt just like I did.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey laughed and Izzart forced himself to laugh too. He noticed that\nCampion had told the story in precisely the same words as he had used\nwhen he told it to the skipper of the <i>Sultan Ahmed</i>. There could be\nonly one explanation of that; he knew, he knew everything, and had made\nup his mind exactly what story to tell. The ingenuity with which Campion\ngave the facts and yet left out what must be to Izzart's discredit was\ndevilish. But why was he holding his hand? It wasn't in him not to feel\ncontempt and resentment for the man who had callously deserted him in\nthat moment of dreadful peril. Suddenly, in a flash of inspiration\nIzzart understood: he was keeping the truth to tell to Willis, the\nResident. Izzart had goos-flesh as he thought of confronting Willis. He\ncould deny, but would his denials serve him? Willis was no fool, and he\nwould get at Hassan; Hassan could not be trusted to be silent; Hassan\nwould give him away. Then he would be done for. Willis would suggest\nthat he had better go home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had a racking headache, and after dinner he went to his room for he\nwanted to be alone so that he could devise a plan of action. And then a\nthought came to him which made him go hot and cold: he knew that the\nsecret which he had guarded so long was a secret to nobody. He was on a\nsudden certain of it. Why should he have those bright eyes and that\nswarthy skin? Why should he speak Malay with such ease and have learned\nDyak so quickly? Of course they knew. What a fool he was ever to think\nthat they believed that story of his, about the Spanish grandmother!\nThey must have laughed up their sleeves when he told it, and behind his\nback they had called him a damned nigger. And now another thought came\nto him, torturing, and he asked himself whether it was on account of\nthat wretched drop of native blood in him that when he heard Campion cry\nout his nerve failed him. After all, anyone might at that moment have\nbeen seized with panic; and why in God's name should he sacrifice his\nlife to save a man's whom he cared nothing for? It was insane. But of\ncourse in K. S. they would say it was only what they expected; they\nwould make no allowances.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last he went to bed, but when, after tossing about recklessly for God\nknows how long, he fell asleep, he was awakened by a fearful dream; he\nseemed to be once more in that raging torrent, with the boat turning,\nturning; and then there was the desperate clutching at the gunwale, and\nthe agony as it slipped out of his hands, and the water that roared over\nhim. He was wide awake before dawn. His only chance was to see Willis\nand get his story in first; and he thought over carefully what he was\ngoing to say, and chose the very words he meant to use.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got up early, and in order not to see Campion went out without\nbreakfast. He walked along the high road till such time as he knew the\nResident would be in his office, and then walked back again. He sent in\nhis name and was ushered into Willis's room. He was a little elderly man\nwith thin grey hair and a long yellow face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm glad to see you back safe and sound,\" he said, shaking hands with\nIzzart. \"What's this I hear about your being nearly drowned?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart, in clean ducks, his topee spotless, was a fine figure of a man.\nHis black hair was neatly brushed, and his moustache was trimmed. He had\nan upright and soldierly bearing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought I'd better come and tell you at once, sir, as you told me to\nlook after Campion.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fire away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart told his story. He made light of the danger. He gave Willis to\nunderstand that it had not been very great. They would never have been\nupset if they had not started so late.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I tried to get Campion away earlier, but he'd had two or three drinks\nand the fact is, he didn't want to move.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Was he tight?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know about that,\" smiled Izzart good-humouredly. \"I shouldn't\nsay he was cold sober.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went on with his story. He managed to insinuate that Campion had lost\nhis head a little. Of course it was a very frightening business to a man\nwho wasn't a decent swimmer: he, Izzart, had been more concerned for\nCampion than for himself; he knew the only chance was to keep cool, and\nthe moment they were upset he saw that Campion had got the wind up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't blame him for that,\" said the Resident.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I did everything I possibly could for him, sir, but the fact\nis, there wasn't anything much I could do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, the great thing is that you both escaped. It would have been very\nawkward for all of us if he'd been drowned.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought I'd better come and tell you the facts before you saw\nCampion, sir. I fancy he's inclined to talk rather wildly about it.\nThere's no use exaggerating.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"On the whole your stories agree pretty well,\" said Willis, with a\nlittle smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart looked at him blankly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Haven't you seen Campion this morning? I heard from Goring that there'd\nbeen some trouble, and I looked in last night on my way home from the\nFort after dinner. You'd already gone to bed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart felt himself trembling, and he made a great effort to preserve\nhis composure.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, you got away first, didn't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't really know, sir. You see, there was a lot of confusion.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must have if you got over to the other side before he did.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose I did then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, thanks for coming to tell me,\" said Willis, rising from his\nchair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs he did so he knocked some books on the floor. They fell with a sudden\nthud. The unexpected sound made Izzart start violently, and he gave a\ngasp. The Resident looked at him quickly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, your nerves are in a pretty state.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart could not control his trembling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm very sorry, sir,\" he murmured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I expect it's been a shock. You'd better take it easy for a few days.\nWhy don't you get the doctor to give you something?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't sleep very well last night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Resident nodded as though he understood. Izzart left the room, and\nas he passed out some man he knew stopped and congratulated him on his\nescape. They all knew of it. He walked back to the rest-house. And as he\nwalked, he repeated to himself the story he had told the Resident. Was\nit really the same story that Campion had told? He had never suspected\nthat the Resident had already heard it from Campion. What a fool he had\nbeen to go to bed! He should never have let Campion out of his sight.\nWhy had the Resident listened without telling him that he already knew?\nNow Izzart cursed himself for having suggested that Campion was drunk\nand had lost his head. He had said this in order to discredit him, but\nhe knew now that it was a stupid thing to do. And why had Willis said\nthat about his having got away first? Perhaps he was holding his hand\ntoo; perhaps he was going to make enquiries; Willis was very shrewd. But\nwhat exactly had Campion said? He must know that; at whatever cost he\nmust know. Izzart's mind was seething, so that he felt he could hardly\nkeep a hold on his thoughts, but he must keep calm. He felt like a\nhunted animal. He did not believe that Willis liked him; once or twice\nin the office he had blamed him because he was careless; perhaps he was\njust waiting till he got all the facts. Izzart was almost hysterical.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe entered the rest-house and there, sitting on a long chair, with his\nlegs stretched out, was Campion. He was reading the papers which had\narrived during their absence in the jungle. Izzart felt a blind rush of\nhatred well up in him as he looked at the little, shabby man who held\nhim in the hollow of his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa,\" said Campion, looking up. \"Where have you been?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo Izzart it seemed that there was in his eyes a mocking irony. He\nclenched his hands, and his breath came fast.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What have you been saying to Willis about me?\" he asked abruptly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe tone in which he put the unexpected question was so harsh that\nCampion gave him a glance of faint surprise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think I've been saying anything very much about you. Why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He came here last night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart looked at him intently. His brows were drawn together in an angry\nfrown as he tried to read Campion's thoughts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I told him you'd gone to bed with a headache. He wanted to know about\nour mishap.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've just seen him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart walked up and down the large and shaded room; now, though it was\nstill early, the sun was hot and dazzling. He felt himself in a net. He\nwas blind with rage; he could have seized Campion by the throat and\nstrangled him, and yet, because he did not know what he had to fight\nagainst, he felt himself powerless. He was tired and ill, and his nerves\nwere shaken. On a sudden the anger which had given him a sort of\nstrength left him, and he was filled with despondency. It was as though\nwater and not blood ran through his veins; his heart sank and his knees\nseemed to give way. He felt that if he did not take care, he would begin\nto cry. He was dreadfully sorry for himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damn you, I wish to God I'd never set eyes on you,\" he cried pitifully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What on earth's the matter?\" asked Campion, with astonishment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, don't pretend. We've been pretending for two days, and I'm fed up\nwith it.\" His voice rose shrilly, it sounded odd in that robust and\npowerful man. \"I'm fed up with it. I cut and run. I left you to drown. I\nknow I behaved like a skunk. I couldn't help it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCampion rose slowly from his chair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What <i>are</i> you talking about?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis tone was so genuinely surprised that it gave Izzart a start. A cold\nshiver ran down his spine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When you called for help I was panic-stricken. I just caught hold of an\noar and got Hassan to help me get away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That was the most sensible thing you could do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I couldn't help you. There wasn't a thing I could do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course not. It was damned silly of me to shout. It was waste of\nbreath, and breath was the very thing I wanted.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean to say you didn't know?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When those fellows got me the mattress, I thought you were still\nclinging to the boat. I had an idea that I got away before you did.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart put both his hands to his head, and gave a hoarse cry of despair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My God, what a fool I've been.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe two men stood for a while staring at one another. The silence seemed\nendless.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do now?\" asked Izzart at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my dear fellow, don't worry. I've been frightened too often myself\nto blame anyone who shows the white feather. I'm not going to tell a\nsoul.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, but you <i>know</i>.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I promise you, you can trust me. Besides, my job's done here and I'm\ngoing home. I want to catch the next boat to Singapore.\" There was a\npause, and Campion looked for a while reflectively at Izzart. \"There's\nonly one thing I'd like to ask you: I've made a good many friends here,\nand there are one or two things I'm a little sensitive about; when you\ntell the story of our upset, I should be grateful if you wouldn't make\nout that I had behaved badly. I wouldn't like the fellows here to think\nthat I'd lost my nerve.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIzzart flushed darkly. He remembered what he had said to the Resident.\nIt almost looked as though Campion had been listening over his shoulder.\nHe cleared his throat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know why you think I should do that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCampion chuckled good-naturedly, and his blue eyes were gay with\namusement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The yellow streak,\" he replied, and then, with a grin that showed his\nbroken and discoloured teeth: \"Have a cheroot, dear boy.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nShe was sitting on the verandah waiting for her husband to come in for\nluncheon. The Malay boy had drawn the blinds when the morning lost its\nfreshness, but she had partly raised one of them so that she could look\nat the river. Under the breathless sun of mid-day it had the white\npallor of death. A native was paddling along in a dug-out so small that\nit hardly showed above the surface of the water. The colours of the day\nwere ashy and wan. They were but the various tones of the heat. (It was\nlike an Eastern melody, in the minor key, which exacerbates the nerves\nby its ambiguous monotony; and the ear awaits impatiently a resolution,\nbut waits in vain.) The cicadas sang their grating song with a frenzied\nenergy; it was as continual and monotonous as the rustling of a brook\nover the stones; but on a sudden it was drowned by the loud singing of a\nbird, mellifluous and rich; and for an instant, with a catch at her\nheart, she thought of the English blackbird.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen she heard her husband's step on the gravel path behind the\nbungalow, the path that led to the court-house in which he had been\nworking, and she rose from her chair to greet him. He ran up the short\nflight of steps, for the bungalow was built on piles, and at the door\nthe boy was waiting to take his topee. He came into the room which\nserved them as a dining-room and parlour, and his eyes lit up with\npleasure as he saw her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa, Doris. Hungry?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ravenous.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It'll only take me a minute to have a bath and then I'm ready.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Be quick,\" she smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe disappeared into his dressing-room and she heard him whistling\ncheerily while, with the carelessness with which she was always\nremonstrating, he tore off his clothes and flung them on the floor. He\nwas twenty-nine, but he was still a schoolboy; he would never grow up.\nThat was why she had fallen in love with him, perhaps, for no amount of\naffection could persuade her that he was good-looking. He was a little\nround man, with a red face like the full moon, and blue eyes. He was\nrather pimply. She had examined him carefully and had been forced to\nconfess to him that he had not a single feature which she could praise.\nShe had told him often that he wasn't her type at all.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never said I was a beauty,\" he laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't think what it is I see in you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut of course she knew perfectly well. He was a gay, jolly little man,\nwho took nothing very solemnly, and he was constantly laughing. He made\nher laugh too. He found life an amusing rather than a serious business,\nand he had a charming smile. When she was with him she felt happy and\ngood-tempered. And the deep affection which she saw in those merry blue\neyes of his touched her. It was very satisfactory to be loved like that.\nOnce, sitting on his knees, during their honeymoon she had taken his\nface in her hands and said to him:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're an ugly, little fat man, Guy, but you've got charm. I can't help\nloving you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA wave of emotion swept over her and her eyes filled with tears. She saw\nhis face contorted for a moment with the extremity of his feeling and\nhis voice was a little shaky when he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a terrible thing for me to have married a woman who's mentally\ndeficient,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe chuckled. It was the characteristic answer which she would have\nliked him to make.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was hard to realise that nine months ago she had never even heard of\nhim. She had met him at a small place by the seaside where she was\nspending a month's holiday with her mother. Doris was secretary to a\nmember of parliament. Guy was home on leave. They were staying at the\nsame hotel, and he quickly told her all about himself. He was born in\nSembulu, where his father had served for thirty years under the second\nSultan, and on leaving school he had entered the same service. He was\ndevoted to the country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After all, England's a foreign land to me,\" he told her. \"My home's\nSembulu.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd now it was her home too. He asked her to marry him at the end of the\nmonth's holiday. She had known he was going to, and had decided to\nrefuse him. She was her widowed mother's only child and she could not go\nso far away from her, but when the moment came she did not quite know\nwhat happened to her, she was carried off her feet by an unexpected\nemotion, and she accepted him. They had been settled now for four months\nin the little outstation of which he was in charge. She was very happy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe told him once that she had quite made up her mind to refuse him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you sorry you didn't?\" he asked, with a merry smile in his\ntwinkling blue eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have been a perfect fool if I had. What a bit of luck that\nfate or chance or whatever it was stepped in and took the matter\nentirely out of my hands!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow she heard Guy clatter down the steps to the bath-house. He was a\nnoisy fellow and even with bare feet he could not be quiet. But he\nuttered an exclamation. He said two or three words in the local dialect\nand she could not understand. Then she heard someone speaking to him,\nnot aloud, but in a sibilant whisper. Really it was too bad of people to\nwaylay him when he was going to have his bath. He spoke again and though\nhis voice was low she could hear that he was vexed. The other voice was\nraised now; it was a woman's. Doris supposed it was someone who had a\ncomplaint to make. It was like a Malay woman to come in that\nsurreptitious way. But she was evidently getting very little from Guy,\nfor she heard him say: Get out. That at all events she understood, and\nthen she heard him bolt the door. There was a sound of the water he was\nthrowing over himself (the bathing arrangements still amused her, the\nbath-houses were under the bedrooms, on the ground; you had a large tub\nof water and you sluiced yourself with a little tin pail) and in a\ncouple of minutes he was back again in the dining-room. His hair was\nstill wet. They sat down to luncheon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's lucky I'm not a suspicious or a jealous person,\" she laughed. \"I\ndon't know that I should altogether approve of your having animated\nconversations with ladies while you're having your bath.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis face, usually so cheerful, had borne a sullen look when he came in,\nbut now it brightened.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wasn't exactly pleased to see her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So I judged by the tone of your voice. In fact, I thought you were\nrather short with the young person.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damned cheek, waylaying me like that!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did she want?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I don't know. It's a woman from the kampong. She's had a row with\nher husband or something.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder if it's the same one who was hanging about this morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe frowned a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Was there someone hanging about?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I went into your dressing-room to see that everything was nice and\ntidy, and then I went down to the bath-house. I saw someone slink out of\nthe door as I went down the steps and when I looked out I saw a woman\nstanding there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you speak to her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I asked her what she wanted and she said something, but I couldn't\nunderstand.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not going to have all sorts of stray people prowling about here,\"\nhe said. \"They've got no right to come.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe smiled, but Doris, with the quick perception of a woman in love,\nnoticed that he smiled only with his lips, not as usual with his eyes\nalso, and wondered what it was that troubled him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What have you been doing this morning?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, nothing much. I went for a little walk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Through the kampong?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. I saw a man send a chained monkey up a tree to pick coconuts,\nwhich rather thrilled me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's rather a lark, isn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Guy, there were two little boys watching him who were much whiter\nthan the others. I wondered if they were half-castes. I spoke to them,\nbut they didn't know a word of English.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There are two or three half-caste children in the kampong,\" he\nanswered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who do they belong to?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Their mother is one of the village girls.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is their father?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my dear, that's the sort of question we think it a little dangerous\nto ask out here.\" He paused. \"A lot of fellows have native wives, and\nthen when they go home or marry they pension them off and send them back\nto their village.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDoris was silent. The indifference with which he spoke seemed a little\ncallous to her. There was almost a frown on her frank, open, pretty\nEnglish face when she replied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what about the children?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have no doubt they're properly provided for. Within his means, a man\ngenerally sees that there's enough money to have them decently educated.\nThey get jobs as clerks in a government office, you know; they're all\nright.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a slightly rueful smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't expect me to think it's a very good system.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You mustn't be too hard,\" he smiled back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not hard. But I'm thankful you never had a Malay wife. I should\nhave hated it. Just think if those two little brats were yours.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe boy changed their plates. There was never much variety in their\nmenu. They started luncheon with river fish, dull and insipid, so that a\ngood deal of tomato ketchup was needed to make it palatable, and then\nwent on to some kind of stew. Guy poured Worcester Sauce over it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The old Sultan didn't think it was a white woman's country,\" he said\npresently. \"He rather encouraged people to--keep house with native\ngirls. Of course things have changed now. The country's perfectly quiet\nand I suppose we know better how to cope with the climate.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But, Guy, the eldest of those boys wasn't more than seven or eight and\nthe other was about five.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's awfully lonely on an outstation. Why, often one doesn't see\nanother white man for six months on end. A fellow comes out here when\nhe's only a boy.\" He gave her that charming smile of his which\ntransfigured his round, plain, face. \"There are excuses, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe always found that smile irresistible. It was his best argument. Her\neyes grew once more soft and tender.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sure there are.\" She stretched her hand across the little table and\nput it on his. \"I'm very lucky to have caught you so young. Honestly, it\nwould upset me dreadfully if I were told that you had lived like that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took her hand and pressed it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you happy here, darling?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Desperately.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked very cool and fresh in her linen frock. The heat did not\ndistress her. She had no more than the prettiness of youth, though her\nbrown eyes were fine; but she had a pleasing frankness of expression,\nand her dark, short hair was neat and glossy. She gave you the\nimpression of a girl of spirit and you felt sure that the member of\nparliament for whom she worked had in her a very competent secretary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I loved the country at once,\" she said. \"Although I'm alone so much I\ndon't think I've ever once felt lonely.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course she had read novels about the Malay Archipelago and she had\nformed an impression of a sombre land with great ominous rivers and a\nsilent, impenetrable jungle. When the little coasting steamer set them\ndown at the mouth of the river, where a large boat, manned by a dozen\nDyaks, was waiting to take them to the station, her breath was taken\naway by the beauty, friendly rather than awe-inspiring, of the scene. It\nhad a gaiety, like the joyful singing of birds in the trees, which she\nhad never expected. On each bank of the river were mangroves and nipah\npalms, and behind them the dense green of the forest. In the distance\nstretched blue mountains, range upon range, as far as the eye could see.\nShe had no sense of confinement nor of gloom, but rather of openness and\nwide spaces where the exultant fancy could wander with delight. The\ngreen glittered in the sunshine and the sky was blithe and cheerful. The\ngracious land seemed to offer her a smiling welcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey rowed on, hugging a bank, and high overhead flew a pair of doves. A\nflash of colour, like a living jewel, dashed across their path. It was a\nkingfisher. Two monkeys, with their dangling tails, sat side by side on\na branch. On the horizon, over there on the other side of the broad and\nturbid river, beyond the jungle, was a row of little white clouds, the\nonly clouds in the sky, and they looked like a row of ballet-girls,\ndressed in white, waiting at the back of the stage, alert and merry, for\nthe curtain to go up. Her heart was filled with joy; and now,\nremembering it all, her eyes rested on her husband with a grateful,\nassured affection.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd what fun it had been to arrange their living-room! It was very big.\nOn the floor, when she arrived, was a torn and dirty matting; on the\nwalls of unpainted wood hung (much too high up) photogravures of Academy\npictures, Dyak shields and parangs. The tables were covered with Dyak\ncloth in sombre colours, and on them stood pieces of Brunei brass-ware,\nmuch in need of cleaning, empty cigarette tins and bits of Malay silver.\nThere was a rough wooden shelf with cheap editions of novels and a\nnumber of old travel books in battered leather; and another shelf was\ncrowded with empty bottles. It was a bachelor's room, untidy but stiff;\nand though it amused her she found it intolerably pathetic. It was a\ndreary, comfortless life that Guy had led there, and she threw her arms\nround his neck and kissed him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You poor darling,\" she laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe had deft hands and she soon made the room habitable. She arranged\nthis and that, and what she could not do with she turned out. Her\nwedding-presents helped. Now the room was friendly and comfortable. In\nglass vases were lovely orchids and in great bowls huge masses of\nflowering shrubs. She felt an inordinate pride because it was her house\n(she had never in her life lived in anything but a poky flat) and she\nhad made it charming for him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you pleased with me?\" she asked when she had finished.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite,\" he smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe deliberate understatement was much to her mind. How jolly it was\nthat they should understand each other so well! They were both of them\nshy of displaying emotion, and it was only at rare moments that they\nused with one another anything but ironic banter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey finished luncheon and he threw himself into a long chair to have a\nsleep. She went towards her room. She was a little surprised that he\ndrew her to him as she passed and, making her bend down, kissed her\nlips. They were not in the habit of exchanging embraces at odd hours of\nthe day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A full tummy is making you sentimental, my poor lamb,\" she chaffed him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Get out and don't let me see you again for at least two hours.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't snore.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe left him. They had risen at dawn and in five minutes were fast\nasleep.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDoris was awakened by the sound of her husband's splashing in the\nbath-house. The walls of the bungalow were like a sounding-board and not\na thing that one of them did escaped the other. She felt too lazy to\nmove, but she heard the boy bring the tea things in, so she jumped up\nand ran down into her own bath-house. The water, not cold but cool, was\ndeliciously refreshing. When she came into the sitting-room Guy was\ntaking the rackets out of the press, for they played tennis in the short\ncool of the evening. The night fell at six.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe tennis-court was two or three hundred yards from the bungalow and\nafter tea, anxious not to lose time, they strolled down to it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, look,\" said Doris, \"there's that girl that I saw this morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGuy turned quickly. His eyes rested for a moment on a native woman, but\nhe did not speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a pretty sarong she's got,\" said Doris. \"I wonder where it comes\nfrom.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey passed her. She was slight and small, with the large, dark, starry\neyes of her race and a mass of raven hair. She did not stir as they went\nby, but stared at them strangely. Doris saw then that she was not quite\nso young as she had at first thought. Her features were a trifle heavy\nand her skin was dark, but she was very pretty. She held a small child\nin her arms. Doris smiled a little as she saw it, but no answering smile\nmoved the woman's lips. Her face remained impassive. She did not look at\nGuy, she looked only at Doris, and he walked on as though he did not see\nher. Doris turned to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Isn't that baby a duck?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't notice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was puzzled by the look of his face. It was deathly white, and the\npimples which not a little distressed her were more than commonly red.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you notice her hands and feet? She might be a duchess.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All natives have good hands and feet,\" he answered, but not jovially as\nwas his wont; it was as though he forced himself to speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Doris was not intrigued.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is she, d'you know?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's one of the girls in the kampong.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey had reached the court now. When Guy went up to the net to see that\nit was taut he looked back. The girl was still standing where they had\npassed her. Their eyes met.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shall I serve?\" said Doris.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, you've got the balls on your side.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe played very badly. Generally he gave her fifteen and beat her, but\nto-day she won easily. And he played silently. Generally he was a noisy\nplayer, shouting all the time, cursing his foolishness when he missed a\nball and chaffing her when he placed one out of her reach.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're off your game, young man,\" she cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not a bit,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe began to slam the balls, trying to beat her, and sent one after the\nother into the net. She had never seen him with that set face. Was it\npossible that he was a little out of temper because he was not playing\nwell? The light fell, and they ceased to play. The woman whom they had\npassed stood in exactly the same position as when they came and once\nmore, with expressionless face, she watched them go.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe blinds on the verandah were raised now and on the table between\ntheir two long chairs were bottles and soda-water. This was the hour at\nwhich they had the first drink of the day and Guy mixed a couple of gin\nslings. The river stretched widely before them and on the further bank\nthe jungle was wrapped in the mystery of the approaching night. A native\nwas silently rowing up-stream, standing at the bow of the boat, with two\noars.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I played like a fool,\" said Guy, breaking a silence. \"I'm feeling a bit\nunder the weather.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry. You're not going to have fever, are you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, no. I shall be all right to-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDarkness closed in upon them. The frogs croaked loudly and now and then\nthey heard a few short notes from some singing bird of the night.\nFireflies flitted across the verandah and they made the trees that\nsurrounded it look like Christmas trees lit with tiny candles. They\nsparkled softly. Doris thought she heard a little sigh. It vaguely\ndisturbed her. Guy was always so full of gaiety.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it, old man?\" she said gently. \"Tell mother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing. Time for another drink,\" he answered breezily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext day he was as cheerful as ever and the mail came. The coasting\nsteamer passed the mouth of the river twice a month, once on its way to\nthe coalfields and once on its way back. On the outward journey it\nbrought mail, which Guy sent a boat down to fetch. Its arrival was the\nexcitement of their uneventful lives. For the first day or two they\nskimmed rapidly all that had come, letters, English papers and papers\nfrom Singapore, magazines and books, leaving for the ensuing weeks a\nmore exact perusal. They snatched the illustrated papers from one\nanother. If Doris had not been so absorbed she might have noticed that\nthere was a change in Guy. She would have found it hard to describe and\nharder still to explain. There was in his eyes a sort of watchfulness\nand in his mouth a slight droop of anxiety.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen, perhaps a week later, one morning when she was sitting in the\nshaded room studying a Malay grammar (for she was industriously learning\nthe language) she heard a commotion in the compound. She heard the house\nboy's voice, he was speaking angrily, the voice of another man, perhaps\nit was the water-carrier's, and then a woman's, shrill and vituperative.\nThere was a scuffle. She went to the window and opened the shutters. The\nwater-carrier had hold of a woman's arm and was dragging her along,\nwhile the house boy was pushing her from behind with both hands. Doris\nrecognised her at once as the woman she had seen one morning loitering\nin the compound and later in the day outside the tennis-court. She was\nholding a baby against her breast. All three were shouting angrily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Stop,\" cried Doris. \"What are you doing?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt the sound of her voice the water-carrier let go suddenly and the\nwoman, still pushed from behind, fell to the ground. There was a sudden\nsilence and the house boy looked sullenly into space. The water-carrier\nhesitated a moment and then slunk away. The woman raised herself slowly\nto her feet, arranged the baby on her arm, and stood impassive, staring\nat Doris. The boy said something to her which Doris could not have heard\neven if she had understood; the woman by no change of face showed that\nhis words meant anything to her; but she slowly strolled away. The boy\nfollowed her to the gate of the compound. Doris called to him as he\nwalked back, but he pretended not to hear. She was growing angry now and\nshe called more sharply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come here at once,\" she cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSuddenly, avoiding her wrathful glance, he came towards the bungalow. He\ncame in and stood at the door. He looked at her sulkily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What were you doing with that woman?\" she asked abruptly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tuan say she no come here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You mustn't treat a woman like that. I won't have it. I shall tell the\ntuan exactly what I saw.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe boy did not answer. He looked away, but she felt that he was\nwatching her through his long eyelashes. She dismissed him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That'll do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWithout a word he turned and went back to the servants' quarters. She\nwas exasperated and she found it impossible to give her attention once\nmore to the Malay exercises. In a little while the boy came in to lay\nthe cloth for luncheon. On a sudden he went to the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tuan just coming.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went out to take Guy's hat from him. His quick ears had caught the\nfootsteps before they were audible to her. Guy did not as usual come up\nthe steps immediately; he paused, and Doris at once surmised that the\nboy had gone down to meet him in order to tell him of the morning's\nincident. She shrugged her shoulders. The boy evidently wanted to get\nhis story in first. But she was astonished when Guy came in. His face\nwas ashy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Guy, what on earth's the matter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe flushed a sudden hot red.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing. Why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was so taken aback that she let him pass into his room without a\nword of what she had meant to speak of at once. It took him longer than\nusual to have his bath and change his clothes and luncheon was served\nwhen he came in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Guy,\" she said, as they sat down, \"that woman we saw the other day was\nhere again this morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So I've heard,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The boys were treating her brutally. I had to stop them. You must\nreally speak to them about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThough the Malay understood every word she said, he made no sign that he\nheard. He handed her the toast.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's been told not to come here. I gave instructions that if she\nshowed herself again she was to be turned out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Were they obliged to be so rough?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She refused to go, I don't think they were any rougher than they could\nhelp.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was horrible to see a woman treated like that. She had a baby in her\narms.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hardly a baby. It's three years old.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How d'you know?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know all about her. She hasn't the least right to come here pestering\neverybody.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does she want?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She wants to do exactly what she did. She wants to make a disturbance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a little while Doris did not speak. She was surprised at her\nhusband's tone. He spoke tersely. He spoke as though all this were no\nconcern of hers. She thought him a little unkind. He was nervous and\nirritable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I doubt if we shall be able to play tennis this afternoon,\" he said.\n\"It looks to me as though we were going to have a storm.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe rain was falling when she awoke and it was impossible to go out.\nDuring tea Guy was silent and abstracted. She got her sewing and began\nto work. Guy sat down to read such of the English papers as he had not\nyet gone through from cover to cover; but he was restless; he walked up\nand down the large room and then went out on the verandah. He looked at\nthe steady rain. What was he thinking of? Doris was vaguely uneasy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was not till after dinner that he spoke. During the simple meal he\nhad exerted himself to be his usual gay self, but the exertion was\napparent. The rain had ceased and the night was starry. They sat on the\nverandah. In order not to attract insects they had put out the lamp in\nthe sitting-room. At their feet, with a mighty, formidable sluggishness,\nsilent, mysterious and fatal, flowed the river. It had the terrible\ndeliberation and the relentlessness of destiny.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Doris, I've got something to say to you,\" he said suddenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis voice was very strange. Was it her fancy that he had difficulty in\nkeeping it quite steady? She felt a little pang in her heart because he\nwas in distress, and she put her hand gently into his. He drew it away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's rather a long story. I'm afraid it's not a very nice one and I\nfind it rather difficult to tell. I'm going to ask you not to interrupt\nme, or to say anything, till I've finished.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the darkness she could not see his face, but she felt that it was\nhaggard. She did not answer. He spoke in a voice so low that it hardly\nbroke the silence of the night.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was only eighteen when I came out here. I came straight from school.\nI spent three months in Kuala Solor, and then I was sent to a station up\nthe Sembulu river. Of course there was a Resident there and his wife. I\nlived in the court-house, but I used to have my meals with them and\nspend the evening with them. I had an awfully good time. Then the fellow\nwho was here fell ill and had to go home. We were short of men on\naccount of the war and I was put in charge of this place. Of course I\nwas very young, but I spoke the language like a native, and they\nremembered my father. I was as pleased as punch to be on my own.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was silent while he knocked the ashes out of his pipe and refilled\nit. When he lit a match Doris, without looking at him, noticed that his\nhand was unsteady.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd never been alone before. Of course at home there'd been father and\nmother and generally an assistant. And then at school naturally there\nwere always fellows about. On the way out, on the boat, there were\npeople all the time, and at K.S., and the same at my first post. The\npeople there were almost like my own people. I seemed always to live in\na crowd. I like people. I'm a noisy blighter. I like to have a good\ntime. All sorts of things make me laugh and you must have somebody to\nlaugh with. But it was different here. Of course it was all right in the\nday time; I had my work and I could talk to the Dyaks. Although they\nwere head-hunters in those days and now and then I had a bit of trouble\nwith them, they were an awfully decent lot of fellows. I got on very\nwell with them. Of course I should have liked a white man to gas to, but\nthey were better than nothing, and it was easier for me because they\ndidn't look upon me quite as a stranger. I liked the work too. It was\nrather lonely in the evening to sit on the verandah and drink a gin and\nbitters by myself, but I could read. And the boys were about. My own boy\nwas called Abdul. He'd known my father. When I got tired of reading I\ncould give him a shout and have a bit of a jaw with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was the nights that did for me. After dinner the boys shut up and\nwent away to sleep in the kampong. I was all alone. There wasn't a sound\nin the bungalow except now and then the croak of the chik-chak. It used\nto come out of the silence, suddenly, so that it made me jump. Over in\nthe kampong I heard the sound of a gong or fire-crackers. They were\nhaving a good time, they weren't so far away, but I had to stay where I\nwas. I was tired of reading. I couldn't have been more of a prisoner if\nI'd been in jail. Night after night it was the same. I tried drinking\nthree or four whiskies, but it's poor fun drinking alone, and it didn't\ncheer me up; it only made me feel rather rotten next day. I tried going\nto bed immediately after dinner, but I couldn't sleep. I used to lie in\nbed, getting hotter and hotter, and more wide awake, till I didn't know\nwhat to do with myself. By George, those nights were long. D'you know, I\ngot so low, I was so sorry for myself that sometimes--it makes me laugh\nnow when I think of it, but I was only nineteen and a half--sometimes I\nused to cry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then, one evening, after dinner, Abdul had cleared away and was just\ngoing off, when he gave a little cough. He said, wasn't I lonely in the\nhouse all night by myself? 'Oh, no, that's all right,' I said. I didn't\nwant him to know what a damned fool I was, but I expect he knew all\nright. He stood there without speaking, and I knew he wanted to say\nsomething to me. 'What is it?' I said. 'Spit it out.' Then he said that\nif I'd like to have a girl to come and live with me he knew one who was\nwilling. She was a very good girl and he could recommend her. She'd be\nno trouble and it would be someone to have about the bungalow. She'd\nmend my things for me.... I felt awfully low. It had been raining all\nday and I hadn't been able to get any exercise. I knew I shouldn't sleep\nfor hours. It wouldn't cost me very much money, he said, her people were\npoor and they'd be quite satisfied with a small present. Two hundred\nStraits dollars. 'You look,' he said. 'If you don't like her you send\nher away.' I asked him where she was. 'She's here,' he said. 'I call\nher.' He went to the door. She'd been waiting on the steps with her\nmother. They came in and sat down on the floor. I gave them some sweets.\nShe was shy, of course, but cool enough, and when I said something to\nher she gave me a smile. She was very young, hardly more than a child,\nthey said she was fifteen. She was awfully pretty, and she had her best\nclothes on. We began to talk. She didn't say much, but she laughed a lot\nwhen I chaffed her. Abdul said I'd find she had plenty to say for\nherself when she got to know me. He told her to come and sit by me. She\ngiggled and refused, but her mother told her to come, and I made room\nfor her on the chair. She blushed and laughed, but she came, and then\nshe snuggled up to me. The boy laughed too. 'You see, she's taken to you\nalready,' he said. 'Do you want her to stay?' he asked. 'Do you want\nto?' I said to her. She hid her face, laughing, on my shoulder. She was\nvery soft and small. 'Very well,' I said, 'let her stay.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGuy leaned forward and helped himself to a whisky and soda.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"May I speak now?\" asked Doris.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wait a minute, I haven't finished yet. I wasn't in love with her, not\neven at the beginning. I only took her so as to have somebody about the\nbungalow. I think I should have gone mad if I hadn't, or else taken to\ndrink. I was at the end of my tether. I was too young to be quite alone.\nI was never in love with anyone but you.\" He hesitated a moment. \"She\nlived here till I went home last year on leave. It's the woman you've\nseen hanging about.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I guessed that. She had a baby in her arms. Is that your child?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. It's a little girl.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it the only one?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You saw the two small boys the other day in the kampong. You mentioned\nthem.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She has three children then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's quite a family you've got.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe felt the sudden gesture which her remark forced from him, but he did\nnot speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Didn't she know that you were married till you suddenly turned up here\nwith a wife?\" asked Doris.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She knew I was going to be married.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I sent her back to the village before I left here. I told her it was\nall over. I gave her what I'd promised. She always knew it was only a\ntemporary arrangement. I was fed up with it. I told her I was going to\nmarry a white woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But you hadn't even seen me then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I know. But I'd made up my mind to marry when I was home.\" He\nchuckled in his old manner. \"I don't mind telling you that I was getting\nrather despondent about it when I met you. I fell in love with you at\nfirst sight and then I knew it was either you or nobody.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why didn't you tell me? Don't you think it would have been only fair to\ngive me a chance of judging for myself? It might have occurred to you\nthat it would be rather a shock to a girl to find out that her husband\nhad lived for ten years with another girl and had three children.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I couldn't expect you to understand. The circumstances out here are\npeculiar. It's the regular thing. Five men out of six do it, I thought\nperhaps it would shock you and I didn't want to lose you. You see, I was\nmost awfully in love with you. I am now, darling. There was no reason\nthat you should ever know. I didn't expect to come back here. One seldom\ngoes back to the same station after home leave. When we came here I\noffered her money if she'd go to some other village. First she said she\nwould and then she changed her mind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why have you told me now?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's been making the most awful scenes. I don't know how she found out\nthat you knew nothing about it. As soon as she did she began to\nblackmail me. I've had to give her an awful lot of money. I gave orders\nthat she wasn't to be allowed in the compound. This morning she made\nthat scene just to attract your attention. She wanted to frighten me. It\ncouldn't go on like that. I thought the only thing was to make a clean\nbreast of it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a long silence as he finished. At last he put his hand on\nhers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You do understand, Doris, don't you? I know I've been to blame.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe did not move her hand. He felt it cold beneath his.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is she jealous?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I daresay there were all sorts of perks when she was living here, and I\ndon't suppose she much likes not getting them any longer. But she was\nnever in love with me any more than I was in love with her. Native women\nnever do really care for white men, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And the children?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, the children are all right. I've provided for them. As soon as the\nboys are old enough I shall send them to school at Singapore.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do they mean nothing to you at all?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe hesitated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want to be quite frank with you. I should be sorry if anything\nhappened to them. When the first one was expected I thought I'd be much\nfonder of it than I ever had been of its mother. I suppose I should have\nbeen if it had been white. Of course, when it was a baby it was rather\nfunny and touching, but I had no particular feeling that it was mine. I\nthink that's what it is; you see, I have no sense of their belonging to\nme. I've reproached myself sometimes, because it seemed rather\nunnatural, but the honest truth is that they're no more to me than if\nthey were somebody else's children. Of course a lot of slush is talked\nabout children by people who haven't got any.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow she had heard everything. He waited for her to speak, but she said\nnothing. She sat motionless.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is there anything more you want to ask me, Doris?\" he said at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I've got rather a headache. I think I shall go to bed.\" Her voice\nwas as steady as ever. \"I don't quite know what to say. Of course it's\nbeen all very unexpected. You must give me a little time to think.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you very angry with me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. Not at all. Only--only I must be left to myself for a while. Don't\nmove. I'm going to bed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe rose from her long chair and put her hand on his shoulder.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's so very hot to-night. I wish you'd sleep in your dressing-room.\nGood-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was gone. He heard her lock the door of her bedroom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was pale next day and he could see that she had not slept. There was\nno bitterness in her manner, she talked as usual, but without ease; she\nspoke of this and that as though she were making conversation with a\nstranger. They had never had a quarrel, but it seemed to Guy that so\nwould she talk if they had had a disagreement and the subsequent\nreconciliation had left her still wounded. The look in her eyes puzzled\nhim; he seemed to read in them a strange fear. Immediately after dinner\nshe said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not feeling very well to-night. I think I shall go straight to\nbed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my poor darling, I'm so sorry,\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's nothing. I shall be all right in a day or two.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall come in and say good-night to you later.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, don't do that. I shall try and get straight off to sleep.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, then, kiss me before you go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe saw that she flushed. For an instant she seemed to hesitate; then,\nwith averted eyes, she leaned towards him. He took her in his arms and\nsought her lips, but she turned her face away and he kissed her cheek.\nShe left him quickly and again he heard the key turn softly in the lock\nof her door. He flung himself heavily on the chair. He tried to read,\nbut his ear was attentive to the smallest sound in his wife's room. She\nhad said she was going to bed, but he did not hear her move. The silence\nin there made him unaccountably nervous. Shading the lamp with his hand\nhe saw that there was a glimmer under her door; she had not put out her\nlight. What on earth was she doing? He put down his book. It would not\nhave surprised him if she had been angry and had made him a scene, or if\nshe had cried; he could have coped with that; but her calmness\nfrightened him. And then what was that fear which he had seen so plainly\nin her eyes? He thought once more over all he had said to her on the\nprevious night. He didn't know how else he could have put it. After all,\nthe chief point was that he'd done the same as everybody else, and it\nwas all over long before he met her. Of course as things turned out he\nhad been a fool, but anyone could be wise after the event. He put his\nhand to his heart. Funny how it hurt him there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose that's the sort of thing people mean when they say they're\nheartbroken,\" he said to himself. \"I wonder how long it's going on like\nthis?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShould he knock at the door and tell her he must speak to her? It was\nbetter to have it out. He <i>must</i> make her understand. But the silence\nscared him. Not a sound! Perhaps it was better to leave her alone. Of\ncourse it had been a shock. He must give her as long as she wanted.\nAfter all, she knew how devotedly he loved her. Patience, that was the\nonly thing; perhaps she was fighting it out with herself; he must give\nher time; he must have patience.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext morning he asked her if she had slept better.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, much,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you very angry with me?\" he asked piteously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him with candid, open eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not a bit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my dear, I'm so glad. I've been a brute and a beast. I know it's\nbeen hateful for you. But do forgive me. I've been so miserable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do forgive you. I don't even blame you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave her a little rueful smile, and there was in his eyes the look of\na whipped dog.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't much liked sleeping by myself the last two nights.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe glanced away. Her face grew a trifle paler.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've had the bed in my room taken away. It took up so much space. I've\nhad a little camp bed put there instead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear, what are you talking about?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow she looked at him steadily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not going to live with you as your wife again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shook her head. He looked at her in a puzzled way. He could hardly\nbelieve he had heard aright and his heart began to beat painfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But that's awfully unfair to me, Doris.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you think it was a little unfair to me to bring me out here in\nthe circumstances?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But you just said you didn't blame me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's quite true. But the other's different. I can't do it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But how are we going to live together like that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe stared at the floor. She seemed to ponder deeply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When you wanted to kiss me on the lips last night I--it almost made me\nsick.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Doris.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him suddenly and her eyes were cold and hostile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That bed I slept on, is that the bed in which she had her children?\"\nShe saw him flush deeply. \"Oh, it's horrible. How could you?\" She wrung\nher hands, and her twisting, tortured fingers looked like little\nwrithing snakes. But she made a great effort and controlled herself. \"My\nmind is quite made up. I don't want to be unkind to you, but there are\nsome things that you can't ask me to do. I've thought it all over. I've\nbeen thinking of nothing else since you told me, night and day, till I'm\nexhausted. My first instinct was to get up and go. At once. The steamer\nwill be here in two or three days.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Doesn't it mean anything to you that I love you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I know you love me. I'm not going to do that. I want to give us\nboth a chance. I have loved you so, Guy.\" Her voice broke, but she did\nnot cry. \"I don't want to be unreasonable. Heaven knows, I don't want to\nbe unkind. Guy, will you give me time?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know quite what you mean.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I just want you to leave me alone. I'm frightened by the feelings that\nI have.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had been right then; she was afraid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What feelings?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Please don't ask me. I don't want to say anything to wound you. Perhaps\nI shall get over them. Heaven knows, I want to. I'll try, I promise you.\nI'll try. Give me six months. I'll do everything in the world for you,\nbut just that one thing.\" She made a little gesture of appeal. \"There's\nno reason why we shouldn't be happy enough together. If you really love\nme you'll--you'll have patience.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sighed deeply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well,\" he said. \"Naturally I don't want to force you to do\nanything you don't like. It shall be as you say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sat heavily for a little, as though, on a sudden grown old, it was an\neffort to move; then he got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll be getting along to the office.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took his topee and went out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA month passed. Women conceal their feelings better than men and a\nstranger visiting them would never have guessed that Doris was in any\nway troubled. But in Guy the strain was obvious; his round, good-natured\nface was drawn, and in his eyes was a hungry, harassed look. He watched\nDoris. She was gay and she chaffed him as she had been used to do; they\nplayed tennis together; they chatted about one thing and another. But it\nwas evident that she was merely playing a part, and at last, unable to\ncontain himself, he tried to speak again of his connections with the\nMalay woman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Guy, there's no object in going back on all that,\" she answered\nbreezily. \"We've said all we had to say about it and I don't blame you\nfor anything.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why do you punish me then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My poor boy, I don't want to punish you. It's not my fault if...\"\nshe shrugged her shoulders. \"Human nature is very odd.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't understand.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't try.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe words might have been harsh, but she softened them with a pleasant,\nfriendly smile. Every night when she went to bed she leaned over Guy and\nlightly kissed his cheek. Her lips only touched it. It was as though a\nmoth had just brushed his face in its flight.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA second month passed, then a third, and suddenly the six months which\nhad seemed so interminable were over. Guy asked himself whether she\nremembered. He gave a strained attention now to everything she said, to\nevery look on her face and to every gesture of her hands. She remained\nimpenetrable. She had asked him to give her six months; well, he had.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe coasting steamer passed the mouth of the river, dropped their mail,\nand went on its way. Guy busily wrote the letters which it would pick up\non the return journey. Two or three days passed by. It was a Tuesday and\nthe prahu was to start at dawn on Thursday to await the steamer. Except\nat meal time when Doris exerted herself to make conversation they had\nnot of late talked very much together; and after dinner as usual they\ntook their books and began to read; but when the boy had finished\nclearing away and was gone for the night Doris put down hers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Guy, I have something I want to say to you,\" she murmured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis heart gave a sudden thud against his ribs and he felt himself change\ncolour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my dear, don't look like that, it's not so very terrible,\" she\nlaughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he thought her voice trembled a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want you to do something for me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My darling, I'll do anything in the world for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put out his hand to take hers, but she drew it away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want you to let me go home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You?\" he cried, aghast. \"When? Why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've borne it as long as I can. I'm at the end of my tether.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How long do you want to go for? For always?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. I think so.\" She gathered determination. \"Yes, for\nalways.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my God!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis voice broke and she thought he was going to cry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Guy, don't blame me. It really is not my fault. I can't help\nmyself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You asked me for six months. I accepted your terms. You can't say I've\nmade a nuisance of myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, no.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've tried not to let you see what a rotten time I was having.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know. I'm very grateful to you. You've been awfully kind to me.\nListen, Guy, I want to tell you again that I don't blame you for a\nsingle thing you did. After all, you were only a boy, and you did no\nmore than the others; I know what the loneliness is here. Oh, my dear,\nI'm so dreadfully sorry for you. I knew all that from the beginning.\nThat's why I asked you for six months. My commonsense tells me that I'm\nmaking a mountain out of a mole-hill. I'm unreasonable; I'm being unfair\nto you. But, you see, commonsense has nothing to do with it; my whole\nsoul is in revolt. When I see the woman and her children in the village\nI just feel my legs shaking. Everything in this house; when I think of\nthat bed I slept in it gives me goose-flesh.... You don't know what\nI've endured.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I've persuaded her to go away. And I've applied for a\ntransfer.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That wouldn't help. She'll be there always. You belong to them, you\ndon't belong to me. I think perhaps I could have stood it if there'd\nonly been one child, but three; and the boys are quite big boys. For ten\nyears you lived with her.\" And now she came out with what she had been\nworking up to. She was desperate. \"It's a physical thing, I can't help\nit, it's stronger than I am. I think of those thin black arms of hers\nround you and it fills me with a physical nausea. I think of you holding\nthose little black babies in your arms. Oh, its loathsome. The touch of\nyou is odious to me. Each night, when I've kissed you, I've had to brace\nmyself up to it, I've had to clench my hands and force myself to touch\nyour cheek.\" Now she was clasping and unclasping her fingers in a\nnervous agony, and her voice was out of control. \"I know it's I who am\nto blame now. I'm a silly, hysterical woman. I thought I'd get over it.\nI can't, and now I never shall. I've brought it all on myself; I'm\nwilling to take the consequences; if you say I must stay here, I'll\nstay, but if I stay I shall die. I beseech you to let me go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd now the tears which she had restrained so long overflowed and she\nwept broken-heartedly. He had never seen her cry before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I don't want to keep you here against your will,\" he said\nhoarsely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nExhausted, she leaned back in her chair. Her features were all twisted\nand awry. It was horribly painful to see the abandonment of grief on\nthat face which was habitually so placid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm so sorry, Guy. I've broken your life, but I've broken mine too. And\nwe might have been so happy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When do you want to go? On Thursday?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him piteously. He buried his face in his hands. At last he\nlooked up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm tired out,\" he muttered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"May I go?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor two minutes perhaps they sat there without a word. She started when\nthe chik-chak gave its piercing, hoarse and strangely human cry. Guy\nrose and went out on to the verandah. He leaned against the rail and\nlooked at the softly flowing water. He heard Doris go into her room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext morning, up earlier than usual, he went to her door and knocked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have to go up-river to-day. I shan't be back till late.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe understood. He had arranged to be away all day in order not to be\nabout while she was packing. It was heartbreaking work. When she had\npacked her clothes she looked round the sitting-room at the things that\nbelonged to her. It seemed dreadful to take them. She left everything\nbut the photograph of her mother. Guy did not come in till ten o'clock\nat night.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry I couldn't get back to dinner,\" he said. \"The headman at the\nvillage I had to go to had a lot of things for me to attend to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe saw his eyes wander about the room and notice that her mother's\nphotograph no longer stood in its place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is everything quite ready?\" he asked. \"I've ordered the boatman to be\nat the steps at dawn.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I told the boy to wake me at five.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd better give you some money.\" He went to his desk and wrote out a\ncheque. He took some notes from a drawer. \"Here's some cash to take you\nas far as Singapore and at Singapore you'll be able to change the\ncheque.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would you like me to come to the mouth of the river with you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I think it would be better if we said good-bye here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right. I think I shall turn in. I've had a long day and I'm dead\nbeat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not even touch her hand. He went into his room. In a few minutes\nshe heard him throw himself on his bed. For a little while she sat\nlooking for the last time round that room in which she had been so happy\nand so miserable. She sighed deeply. She got up and went into her own\nroom. Everything was packed except the one or two things she needed for\nthe night.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was dark when the boy awakened them. They dressed hurriedly and when\nthey were ready breakfast was waiting for them. Presently they heard the\nboat row up to the landing-stage below the bungalow, and then the\nservants carried down her luggage. It was a poor pretence they made of\neating. The darkness thinned away and the river was ghostly. It was not\nyet day, but it was no longer night. In the silence the voices of the\nnatives at the landing-stage were very clear. Guy glanced at his wife's\nuntouched plate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you've finished we might stroll down. I think you ought to be\nstarting.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe did not answer. She rose from the table. She went into her room to\nsee that nothing had been forgotten and then side by side with him\nwalked down the steps. A little winding path led them to the river. At\nthe landing-stage the native guards in their smart uniform were lined up\nand they presented arms as Guy and Doris passed. The head boatman gave\nher his hand as she stepped into the boat. She turned and looked at Guy.\nShe wanted desperately to say one last word of comfort, once more to ask\nfor his forgiveness, but she seemed to be struck dumb.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe stretched out his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, good-bye, I hope you'll have a jolly journey.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey shook hands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGuy nodded to the head boatman and the boat pushed off. The dawn now was\ncreeping along the river mistily, but the night lurked still in the dark\ntrees of the jungle. He stood at the landing-stage till the boat was\nlost in the shadows of the morning. With a sigh he turned away. He\nnodded absent-mindedly when the guard once more presented arms. But when\nhe reached the bungalow he called the boy. He went round the room\npicking out everything that had belonged to Doris.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pack all these things up,\" he said. \"It's no good leaving them about.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he sat down on the verandah and watched the day advance gradually\nlike a bitter, an unmerited and an overwhelming sorrow. At last he\nlooked at his watch. It was time for him to go to the office.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the afternoon he could not sleep, his head ached miserably, so he\ntook his gun and went for a tramp in the jungle. He shot nothing, but he\nwalked in order to tire himself out. Towards sunset he came back and had\ntwo or three drinks, and then it was time to dress for dinner. There\nwasn't much use in dressing now; he might just as well be comfortable;\nhe put on a loose native jacket and a sarong. That was what he had been\naccustomed to wear before Doris came. He was barefoot. He ate his dinner\nlistlessly and the boy cleared away and went. He sat down to read the\n<i>Tatler</i>. The bungalow was very silent. He could not read and let the\npaper fall on his knees. He was exhausted. He could not think and his\nmind was strangely vacant. The chik-chak was noisy that night and its\nhoarse and sudden cry seemed to mock him. You could hardly believe that\nthis reverberating sound came from so small a throat. Presently he heard\na discreet cough.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who' there?\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a pause. He looked at the door. The chik-chak laughed harshly.\nA small boy sidled in and stood on the threshold. It was a little\nhalf-caste boy in a tattered singlet and a sarong. It was the elder of\nhis two sons.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you want?\" said Guy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe boy came forward into the room and sat down, tucking his legs away\nunder him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who told you to come here?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My mother sent me. She says, do you want anything?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGuy looked at the boy intently. The boy said nothing more. He sat and\nwaited, his eyes cast down shyly. Then Guy in deep and bitter reflection\nburied his face in his hands. What was the use? It was finished.\nFinished! He surrendered. He sat back in his chair and sighed deeply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell your mother to pack up her things and yours.

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nNorman Grange was a rubber-planter. He was up before day-break to take\nthe roll-call of his labour and then walked over the estate to see that\nthe tapping was properly done. This duty performed, he came home, bathed\nand changed, and now with his wife opposite him he was eating the\nsubstantial meal, half breakfast and half luncheon, which in Borneo is\ncalled brunch. He read as he ate. The dining-room was dingy. The worn\nelectro-plate, the shabby cruet, the chipped dishes betokened poverty,\nbut a poverty accepted with apathy. A few flowers would have brightened\nthe table, but there was apparently no one to care how things looked.\nWhen Grange had finished he belched, filled his pipe and lit it, rose\nfrom the table and went out on to the verandah. He took no more notice\nof his wife than if she had not been there. He lay down in a long rattan\nchair and went on reading. Mrs. Grange reached over for a tin of\ncigarettes and smoked while she sipped her tea. Suddenly she looked out,\nfor the house boy came up the steps and accompanied by two men went up\nto her husband. One was a Dyak and the other Chinese. Strangers seldom\ncame and she could not imagine what they wanted. She got up and went to\nthe door to listen. Though she had lived in Borneo for so many years she\nknew no more Malay than was necessary to get along with the boys, and\nshe only vaguely understood what was said. She gathered from her\nhusband's tone that something had happened to annoy him. He seemed to be\nasking questions first of the Chink and then of the Dyak; it looked as\nthough they were pressing him to do something he didn't want to do; at\nlength, however, with a frown on his face he raised himself from his\nchair and followed by the men walked down the steps. Curious to see\nwhere he was going she slipped out on to the verandah. He had taken the\npath that led down to the river. She shrugged her thin shoulders and\nwent to her room. Presently she gave a violent start, for she heard her\nhusband call her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Vesta.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe came out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Get a bed ready. There's a white man in a prahu at the landing-stage.\nHe's damned ill.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How the hell should I know? They're just bringing him up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We can't have anyone to stay here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shut up and do as I tell you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe left her on that and again went down to the river. Mrs. Grange called\nthe boy and told him to put sheets on the bed in the spare room. Then\nshe stood at the top of the steps and waited. In a little while she saw\nher husband coming back and behind him a huddle of Dyaks carrying a man\non a mattress. She stood aside to let them pass and caught a glimpse of\na white face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What shall I do?\" she asked her husband.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Get out and keep quiet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Polite, aren't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe sick man was taken into the room, and in two or three minutes the\nDyaks and Grange came out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going to see about his kit. I'll have it brought up. His boy's\nlooking after him and there's no cause for you to butt in!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's the matter with him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Malaria. His boatmen are afraid he's going to die and won't take him\non. His name's Skelton.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He isn't going to die, is he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If he does we'll bury him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Skelton didn't die. He woke next morning to find himself in a room,\nin bed and under a mosquito-net. He couldn't think where he was. It was\na cheap iron bed and the mattress was hard, but to lie on it was a\nrelief after the discomfort of the prahu. He could see nothing of the\nroom but a chest of drawers, roughly made by a native carpenter, and a\nwooden chair. Opposite was a doorway, with a blind down, and this he\nguessed led on to a verandah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Kong,\" he called.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe blind was drawn aside and his boy came in. The Chinaman's face broke\ninto a grin when he saw that his master was free from fever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You more better, Tuan. Velly glad.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where the devil am I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKong explained.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Luggage all right?\" asked Skelton.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, him all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's the name of this fellow--the tuan whose house this is?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Norman Glange.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo confirm what he said he showed Skelton a little book in which the\nowner's name was written. It was Grange. Skelton noticed that the book\nwas Bacon's <i>Essays</i>. It was curious to find it in a planter's house\naway up a river in Borneo.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell him I'd be glad to see him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tuan out. Him come presently.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What about my having a wash? And by God, I want a shave.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe tried to get out of bed, but his head swam and with a bewildered cry\nhe sank back. But Kong shaved and washed him, and changed the shorts and\nsinglet in which he had been lying ever since he fell ill for a sarong\nand a baju. After that he was glad to lie still. But presently Kong came\nin and said that the tuan of the house was back. There was a knock on\nthe door and a large stoutish man stepped in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hear you're better,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, much. It's terribly kind of you to have taken me in like this. It\nseems awful, planting myself on you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGrange answered a trifle harshly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's all right. You were pretty bad, you know. No wonder those Dyaks\nwanted to get rid of you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want to impose myself on you longer than I need. If I could\nhire a launch here, or a prahu, I could get off this afternoon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no launch to hire. You'd better stay a bit. You must be as weak\nas a rat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I shall be a frightful bother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't see why. You've got your own boy and he'll look after you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGrange had just come in from his round of the estate and wore dirty\nshorts, a khaki shirt open at the neck and an old, battered terai hat.\nHe looked as shabby as a beachcomber. He took off his hat to wipe his\nsweating brow; he had close-cropped grey hair; his face was red, a\nbroad, fleshy face, with a large mouth under a stubble of grey\nmoustache, a short, pugnacious nose and small, mean eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder if you could let me have something to read,\" said Skelton.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What sort of thing?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't mind so long as it's lightish.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not much of a novel reader myself, but I'll send you in two or\nthree books. My wife can provide you with novels. They'll be trash,\nbecause that's all she reads. But it may suit you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith a nod he withdrew. Not a very likeable man. But he was obviously\nvery poor, the room in which Skelton lay, something in Grange's\nappearance, indicated that; he was probably manager of an estate on a\ncut salary, and it was not unlikely that the expense of a guest and his\nservant was unwelcome. Living in that remote spot, and so seeing white\nmen but seldom, it might be that he was ill at ease with strangers. Some\npeople improve unbelievably on acquaintance. But his hard, shifty little\neyes were disconcerting; they gave the lie to the red face and the\nmassive frame which otherwise might have persuaded you that this was a\njolly sort of fellow with whom you could quickly make friends.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter a while the house boy came in with a parcel of books. There were\nhalf a dozen novels by authors he had never heard of, and a glance told\nhim they were slop; these must be Mrs. Grange's; and then there was a\nBoswell's <i>Johnson</i>, Borrow's <i>Lavengro</i> and Lamb's <i>Essays</i>. It was an\nodd choice. They were not the books you would have expected to find in a\nplanter's house. In most planter's houses there is not more than a shelf\nor two of books and for the most part they're detective stories. Skelton\nhad a disinterested curiosity in human creatures, and he amused himself\nnow by trying to make out from the books Norman Grange had sent, from\nthe look of him and from the few words they had exchanged, what sort of\na man he could be. Skelton was a little surprised that his host did not\ncome to see him again that day; it looked as though he were going to\ncontent himself with giving his uninvited guest board and lodging, but\nwere not sufficiently interested in him to seek his company. Next\nmorning he felt well enough to get up, and with Kong's help settled\nhimself in a long chair on the verandah. It badly needed a coat of\npaint. The bungalow stood on the brow of a hill, about fifty yards from\nthe river; and on the opposite bank, looking very small across that\ngreat stretch of water, you could see native houses on piles nestling\namong the greenery. Skelton had not yet the activity of mind to read\nsteadily, and after a page or two, his thoughts wandering, he found\nhimself content to watch idly the sluggish flow of the turbid stream.\nSuddenly he heard a step. He saw a little elderly woman come towards\nhim, and knowing that this must be Mrs. Grange tried to get up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't move,\" she said. \"I only came to see if you had everything you\nwanted.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe wore a blue cotton dress, simple enough, but more suited to a young\ngirl than to a woman of her age; her short hair was tousled, as though\non getting out of bed she had scarcely troubled to pass a comb through\nit, and dyed a vivid yellow, but badly, and the roots showed white. Her\nskin was raddled and dry, and there was a great dab of rouge on each\ncheek-bone, put on however so clumsily that you could not for a moment\ntake it for a natural colour, and a smear of lipstick on her mouth. But\nthe strangest thing about her was a tic she had that made her jerk her\nhead as though she were beckoning you to an inner room. It seemed to\ncome at regular intervals, perhaps three times a minute, and her left\nhand was in almost constant movement; it was not quite a tremble, it was\na rapid twirl as though she wanted to draw your attention to something\nbehind her back. Skelton was startled by her appearance and embarrassed\nby her tic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope I'm not making myself too great a nuisance,\" he said. \"I think I\nshall be well enough to make a move to-morrow or the day after.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not often we see anybody in a place like this, you know. It's a\ntreat to have someone to talk to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Won't you sit down? I'll tell my boy to bring you a chair.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Norman said I was to leave you alone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't spoken to a white person for two years. I've been longing for\na good old talk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer head twitched violently, more quickly than usual, and her hand gave\nthat queer spasmodic gesture.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He won't be back for another hour. I'll get a chair.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSkelton told her who he was and what he had been doing, but he\ndiscovered that she had questioned his boy and already knew all about\nhim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must be crazy to get back to England?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shan't be sorry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSuddenly Mrs. Grange seemed to be attacked by what one could only\ndescribe as a nerve storm. Her head twitched so madly, her hand shook\nwith such fury, that it was disconcerting. You could only look away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't been to England for sixteen years,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't mean that? Why, I thought all you planters went home every\nfive years at the longest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We can't afford it; we're broke to the wide. Norman put all the money\nhe had into this plantation, and it hasn't really paid for years. It\nonly just brings in enough to keep us from starvation. Of course it\ndoesn't matter to Norman. He isn't English really.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He looks English enough.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was born in Sarawak. His father was in the government service. If\nhe's anything he's a native of Borneo.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen, without warning, she began to cry. It was horribly painful to see\nthe tears running down the raddled, painted cheeks of that woman with\nthe constant tic. Skelton knew neither what to say nor what to do. He\ndid what was probably the best thing, he kept silent. She dried her\neyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must think me a silly old fool. I sometimes wonder that after all\nthese years I can still cry. I suppose it's in my nature. I always could\ncry very easy when I was on the stage.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, were you on the stage?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, before I married. That's how I met Norman. We were playing in\nSingapore and he was there on holiday. I don't suppose I shall ever see\nEngland any more. I shall stay here till I die and every day of my life\nI shall look at that beastly river. I shall never get away now. Never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did you happen to find yourself in Singapore?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it was soon after the war, I couldn't get anything to suit me in\nLondon, I'd been on the stage a good many years and I was fed up with\nplaying small parts; the agents told me a fellow called Victor Palace\nwas taking a company out East. His wife was playing lead, but I could\nplay seconds. They'd got half a dozen plays, comedies, you know, and\nfarces. The salary wasn't much, but they were going to Egypt and India,\nthe Malay States and China and then down to Australia. It was a chance\nto see the world and I accepted. We didn't do badly in Cairo and I think\nwe made money in India, but Burma wasn't much good, and Siam was worse;\nPenang was a disaster and so were the rest of the Malay States. Well,\none day Victor called us together and said he was bust, he hadn't got\nthe money for our fares on to Hong Kong, and the tour was a wash-out and\nhe was very sorry but we'd have to get back home as best we could. Of\ncourse we told him he couldn't do that to us. You never heard such a\nrow. Well, the long and short of it was that he said we could have the\nscenery and the props if we thought they was any good to us, but as to\nmoney it was no use asking for it because he damned well hadn't got it.\nAnd next day we found out that him and his wife, without saying a word\nto anybody, had got on a French boat and skipped. I was in a rare state,\nI can tell you. I had a few pounds I'd saved out of me salary, and that\nwas all; somebody told me if we was absolutely stranded the government\nwould have to send us home, but only steerage, and I didn't much fancy\nthat. We got the Press to put our plight before the public and someone\ncame along with the proposition that we should give a benefit\nperformance. Well, we did, but it wasn't much without Victor or his\nwife, and by the time we'd paid the expenses we weren't any better off\nthan we'd been before. I was at my wits' end, I don't mind telling you.\nIt was then that Norman proposed to me. The funny thing is that I hardly\nknew him. He'd taken me for a drive round the island and we'd had tea\ntwo or three times at the Europe and danced. Men don't often do things\nfor you without wanting something in return, and I thought he expected\nto get a little bit of fun, but I'd had a good deal of experience and I\nthought he'd be clever if he got round me. But when he asked me to marry\nhim, well, I was so surprised, I couldn't hardly believe me own ears. He\nsaid he'd got his own estate in Borneo and it only wanted a little\npatience and he'd make a packet. And it was on the banks of a fine river\nand all round was the jungle. He made it sound very romantic. I was\ngetting on, you know, I was thirty, it wasn't going to be any easier to\nget work as time went on, and it was tempting to have a house of me own\nand all that. Never to have to hang around agents' offices no more.\nNever to have to lay awake no more and wonder how you was going to pay\nnext week's rent. He wasn't a bad-looking chap in those days, brown and\nbig and virile. No one could say I was willing to marry anybody just\nto...\" Suddenly she stopped. \"There he is. Don't say you've seen me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe picked up the chair she had been sitting in and quickly slipped away\nwith it into the house. Skelton was bewildered. Her grotesque\nappearance, the painful tears, her story told with that incessant\ntwitching; and then her obvious fear when she heard her husband's voice\nin the compound, and her hurried escape; he could make nothing of it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn a few minutes Norman Grange stumped along the verandah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hear you're better,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Much, thanks.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you care to join us at brunch I'll have a place laid for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd like it very much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right. I'm just going to have a bath and a change.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe walked away. Presently a boy came along and told Skelton his tuan was\nwaiting for him. Skelton followed him into a small sitting-room, with\nthe jalousies drawn to keep out the heat, an uncomfortable, overcrowded\nroom with a medley of furniture, English and Chinese, and occasional\ntables littered with worthless junk. It was neither cosy nor cool.\nGrange had changed into a sarong and baju and in the native dress looked\ncoarse but powerful. He introduced Skelton to his wife. She shook hands\nwith him as though she had never seen him before and uttered a few\npolite words of greeting. The boy announced that their meal was ready\nand they went into the dining-room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hear that you've been in this bloody country for some time,\" said\nGrange.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Two years. I'm an anthropologist and I wanted to study the manners and\ncustoms of tribes that haven't had any contact with civilisation.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSkelton felt that he should tell his host how it had come about that he\nhad been forced to accept a hospitality which he could not but feel was\ngrudgingly offered. After leaving the village that had been his\nheadquarters he had journeyed by land for ten days till he reached the\nriver. There he had engaged a couple of prahus, one for himself and his\nluggage and the other for Kong, his Chinese servant, and the camp\nequipment, to take him to the coast. The long trek across country had\nbeen hard going and he found it very comfortable to lie on a mattress\nunder an awning of rattan matting and take his ease. All the time he had\nbeen away Skelton had been in perfect health, and as he travelled down\nthe river he could not but think that he was very lucky; but even as the\nthought passed through his mind, it occurred to him that if he happened\njust then to congratulate himself on his good fortune in this respect,\nit was because he did not feel quite so well as usual. It was true that\nhe had been forced to drink a great deal of arak the night before at the\nlong-house where he had put up, but he was used to it and that hardly\naccounted for his headache. He had a general sense of malaise. He was\nwearing nothing but shorts and a singlet, and he felt chilly; it was\ncurious because the sun was shining fiercely and when he put his hand on\nthe gunwale of the prahu the heat was hardly bearable. If he had had a\ncoat handy he would have put it on. He grew colder and colder and\npresently his teeth began to chatter; he huddled up on his mattress,\nshivering all over in a desperate effort to get warm. He could not fail\nto guess what was the matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Christ,\" he groaned. \"Malaria.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe called the headman, who was steering the prahu.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Get Kong.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe headman shouted to the second prahu and ordered his own paddlers to\nstop. In a moment the two boats were side by side and Kong stepped in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got fever, Kong,\" gasped Skelton. \"Get me the medicine chest and,\nfor God's sake, blankets. I'm freezing to death.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKong gave his master a big dose of quinine and piled on him what\ncoverings they had. They started off again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSkelton was too ill to be taken ashore when they tied up for the night\nand so passed it in the prahu. All next day and the day after he was\nvery ill. Sometimes one or other of the crew came and looked at him, and\noften the headman stayed for quite a long while staring at him\nthoughtfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How many days to the coast?\" Skelton asked the boy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Four, five.\" He paused for a minute. \"Headman, he no go coast. He say,\nhe wantchee go home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell him to go to hell.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Headman say, you velly sick, you die. If you die and he go coast he\ncatchee trouble.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not thinking of dying,\" said Skelton. \"I shall be all right. It's\njust an ordinary go of malaria.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKong did not answer. The silence irritated Skelton. He knew that the\nChinese had something in mind that he did not like to say.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Spit it out, you fool,\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSkelton's heart sank when Kong told him the truth. When they reached\ntheir resting-place that night the headman was going to demand his money\nand slip away with the two prahus before dawn. He was too frightened to\ncarry a dying man farther. Skelton had no strength to take the\ndetermined attitude that might have availed him; he could only hope by\nthe offer of more money to persuade the headman to carry out his\nagreement. The day passed in long arguments between Kong and the\nheadman, but when they tied up for the night the headman came to Skelton\nand told him sulkily that he would go no farther. There was a long-house\nnear-by where he might get lodging till he grew better. He began to\nunload the baggage. Skelton refused to move. He got Kong to give him his\nrevolver and swore to shoot anyone who came near him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKong, the crew and the headman went up to the long-house and Skelton was\nleft alone. Hour after hour he lay there, the fever burning his body and\nhis mouth parched, while muddled thoughts hammered away in his brain.\nThen there were lights and the sound of men talking. The Chinese boy\ncame with the headman and another man, whom Skelton had not yet seen,\nfrom the neighbouring long-house. He did his best to understand what\nKong was telling him. It appeared that a few hours down-stream there\nlived a white man, and to his house, if that would satisfy Skelton, the\nheadman was willing to take him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"More better you say yes,\" said Kong. \"Maybe white man has launch, then\nwe go down to coast chop-chop.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Planter,\" said Kong. \"This fellow say, him have rubber estate.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSkelton was too tired to argue further. All he wanted just then was to\nsleep. He accepted the compromise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To tell you the truth,\" he finished, \"I don't remember much more till I\nwoke up yesterday morning to find myself an uninvited guest in your\nhouse.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't blame those Dyaks, you know,\" said Grange. \"When I came down to\nthe prahu and saw you, I thought you were for it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Grange sat silent while Skelton told his story, her head and her\nhand twitching regularly, as though by the action of some invisible\nclockwork, but when her husband addressed her, asking for the Worcester\nSauce, and that was the only time he spoke to her, she was seized with\nsuch a paroxysm of involuntary movement that it was horrible to see. She\npassed him what he asked for without a word. Skelton got an\nuncomfortable impression that she was terrified of Grange. It was odd,\nbecause to all appearance he was not a bad sort. He was knowledgeable\nand far from stupid; and though you could not have said that his manner\nwas cordial, it was plain that he was ready to be of what service he\ncould.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey finished their meal and separated to rest through the heat of the\nday.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"See you again at six for a sun-downer,\" said Grange.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Skelton had had a good sleep, a bath and a read, he went out on to\nthe verandah. Mrs. Grange came up to him. It looked as though she had\nbeen waiting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's back from the office. Don't think it's funny if I don't speak to\nyou. If he thought I liked having you here he'd turn you out to-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe said these words in a whisper and slipped back into the house.\nSkelton was startled. It was a strange house he had come into in a\nstrange manner. He went into the overcrowded sitting-room and there\nfound his host. He had been worried by the evident poverty of the\nestablishment and he felt that the Granges could ill afford even the\nsmall expense he must be putting them to. But he had already formed the\nimpression that Grange was a quick-tempered, susceptible man and he did\nnot know how he would take an offer to help. He made up his mind to risk\nit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here,\" he said to him, \"it looks as though I might have to inflict\nmyself on you for several days, I'd be so much more comfortable if you'd\nlet me pay for my board and lodging.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, that's all right, your lodging costs nothing, the house belongs to\nthe mortgagees, and your board doesn't come to much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, there are drinks anyway and I've had to come down on your stores\nof tobacco and cigarettes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not more than once a year that anyone comes up here, and then it's\nonly the D.O. or someone like that--besides, when one's as broke as I am\nnothing matters much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, then, will you take my camp equipment? I shan't be wanting it any\nmore, and if you'd like one of my guns, I'd be only too glad to leave it\nwith you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGrange hesitated. There was a glimmer of cupidity in those small,\ncunning eyes of his.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you'd let me have one of your guns you'd pay for your board and\nlodging over and over again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's settled, then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey began to talk over the whisky and sparkler with which, following\nthe Eastern habit, they celebrated the setting of the sun. Discovering\nthat they both played chess they had a game. Mrs. Grange did not join\nthem till dinner. The meal was dull. An insipid soup, a tasteless river\nfish, a tough piece of steak and a caramel pudding. Norman Grange and\nSkelton drank beer; Mrs. Grange water. She never of her own will uttered\na word. Skelton had again the uncomfortable impression that she was\nscared to death of her husband. Once or twice, Skelton from common\npoliteness sought to bring her into the conversation, addressing himself\nto her, telling her a story or asking her a question, but it evidently\ndistressed her so much, her head twitched so violently, her hand was\nagitated by gestures so spasmodic that he thought it kinder not to\ninsist. When the meal was over she got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll leave you gentlemen to your port,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBoth the men got up as she left the room. It was rather absurd, and\nsomehow sinister, to see this social pretence in those poverty-stricken\nsurroundings on a Borneo river.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I may add that there is no port. There might be a little Benedictine\nleft.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, don't bother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey talked for a while and Grange began to yawn. He got up every\nmorning before sunrise and by nine o'clock at night could hardly keep\nhis eyes open.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'm going to turn in,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe nodded to Skelton and without further ceremony left him. Skelton went\nto bed, but he could not sleep. Though the heat was oppressive, it was\nnot the heat that kept him awake. There was something horrible about\nthat house and those two people who lived in it. He didn't know what it\nwas that affected him with this peculiar uneasiness, but this he knew,\nthat he would be heartily thankful to be out of it and away from them.\nGrange had talked a good deal about himself, but he knew no more of him\nthan he had learned at the first glance. To all appearances he was just\nthe commonplace planter who had fallen upon evil days. He had bought his\nland immediately after the war and had planted trees; but by the time\nthey were bearing the slump had come and since then it had been a\nconstant struggle to keep going. The estate and the house were heavily\nmortgaged, and now that rubber was once more selling profitably all he\nmade went to the mortgagees. That was an old story in Malaya. What made\nGrange somewhat unusual was that he was a man without a country. Born in\nBorneo, he had lived there with his parents till he was old enough to go\nto school in England; at seventeen he had come back and had never left\nit since except to go to Mesopotamia during the war. England meant\nnothing to him. He had neither relations nor friends there. Most\nplanters, like civil servants, have come from England, go back on leave\nnow and then, and look forward to settling down there when they retire.\nBut what had England to offer Norman Grange?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was born here,\" he said, \"and I shall die here. I'm a stranger in\nEngland. I don't like their ways over there and I don't understand the\nthings they talk about. And yet I'm a stranger here too. To the Malays\nand the Chinese I'm a white man, though I speak Malay as well as they\ndo, and a white man I shall always be.\" Then he said a significant\nthing. \"Of course if I'd had any sense I'd have married a Malay girl and\nhad half a dozen half-caste kids. That's the only solution really for us\nchaps who were born and bred here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGrange's bitterness was greater than could be explained by his financial\nembarrassment. He had little good to say of any of the white men in the\ncolony. He seemed to think that they despised him because he was\nnative-born. He was a sour, disappointed fellow, and a conceited one. He\nhad shown Skelton his books. There were not many of them, but they were\nthe best on the whole that English literature can show; he had read them\nover and over again; but it looked as though he had learnt from them\nneither charity nor loving-kindness, it looked as though their beauty\nhad left him unmoved; and to know them so well had only made him\nself-complacent. His exterior, which was so hearty and English, seemed\nto have little relation to the man within; you could not resist the\nsuspicion that it masked a very sinister being.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEarly next morning, to enjoy the cool of the day, Skelton, with his pipe\nand a book, was sitting on the verandah outside his room. He was still\nvery weak, but felt much better. In a little while Mrs. Grange joined\nhim. She held in her hand a large album.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought I'd like to show you some of me old photos and me notices.\nYou mustn't think I always looked like what I do now. He's off on his\nround and he won't be back for two or three hours yet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Grange, in the same blue dress she had worn the day before, her\nhair as untidy, appeared strangely excited.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's all I have to remind me of the past. Sometimes when I can't bear\nlife any more I look at my album.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe sat by Skelton's side as he turned the pages. The notices were from\nprovincial papers, and the references to Mrs. Grange, whose stage name\nhad been apparently Vesta Blaise, were carefully underlined. From the\nphotographs you could see that she had been pretty enough in an\nundistinguished way. She had acted in musical comedy and revue, in farce\nand comedy, and taking the photographs and the notices together it was\neasy to tell that here had been the common, dreary, rather vulgar career\nof the girl with no particular talent who has taken to the stage on the\nstrength of a pretty face and a good figure. Her head twitching, her\nhand shaking, Mrs. Grange looked at the photographs and read the notices\nwith as much interest as if she had never seen them before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got to have influence on the stage, and I never had any,\" she\nsaid. \"If I'd only had my chance I know I'd have made good. I had bad\nluck, there's no doubt about that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was all sordid and somewhat pathetic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I daresay you're better off as you are,\" said Skelton.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe snatched the book from him and shut it with a bang. She had a\nparoxysm so violent that it was really frightening to look at her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What d'you mean by that? What d'you know about the life I lead here?\nI'd have killed myself years ago only I know he wants me to die. That's\nthe only way I can get back on him, by living, and I'm going to live;\nI'm going to live as long as he does. Oh, I hate him. I've often thought\nI'd poison him, but I was afraid. I didn't know how to do it really, and\nif he died the Chinks would foreclose and I'd be turned out. And where\nshould I go then? I haven't a friend in the world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSkelton was aghast. It flashed through his mind that she was crazy. He\nhadn't a notion what to say. She gave him a keen look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose it surprises you to hear me talk like that. I mean it, you\nknow, every word of it. He'd like to kill me too, but he daren't either.\nAnd he knows how to do it all right. He knows how the Malays kill\npeople. He was born here. There's nothing he doesn't know about the\ncountry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSkelton forced himself to speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, Mrs. Grange, I'm a total stranger. Don't you think it's\nrather unwise to tell me all sorts of things there's no need for me to\nknow? After all, you live a very solitary life. I daresay you get on one\nanother's nerves. Now that things are looking up perhaps you'll be able\nto take a trip to England.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want to go to England. I'd be ashamed to let them see me like I\nam now. D'you know how old I am? Forty-six. I look sixty and I know it.\nThat's why I showed you those photos, so as you might see I wasn't\nalways like what I am now. Oh, my God, how I've wasted my life! They\ntalk of the romance of the East. They can have it. I'd rather be a\ndresser in a provincial theatre, I'd rather be one of the sweepers that\nkeep it clean, than what I am now. Until I came here I'd never been\nalone in me life, I'd always lived in a crowd; you don't know what it is\nto have nobody to talk to from year's end to year's end. To have to keep\nit all bottled up. How would you like to see no one, week in and week\nout, day after day for sixteen years, except the man you hate most in\nthe world? How would you like to live for sixteen years with a man who\nhates you so he can't bear to look at you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, come, it can't be as bad as that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm telling you the truth. Why should I tell you a lie? I shall never\nsee you again; what do I care what you think of me? And if you tell them\nwhat I've said when you get down to the coast, what's the odds? They'll\nsay: 'God, you don't mean to say you stayed with those people? I pity\nyou. He's an outsider and she's crazy; got a tic; they say it looks as\nif she was always trying to wipe the blood off her dress. They were\nmixed up in a damned funny business, but no one ever really knew the ins\nand outs of it; it all happened a long time ago and the country was\npretty wild in those days.' A damned funny business and no mistake. I'd\ntell you for two pins. That would be a bit of dirt for them at the club.\nYou wouldn't have to pay for a drink for days. Damn them. Oh, Christ,\nhow I hate this country. I hate that river. I hate this house. I hate\nthat damned rubber. I loathe the filthy natives. And that's all I've got\nto look forward to till I die--till I die without a doctor to take care\nof me, without a friend to hold me hand.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe began to cry hysterically. Mrs. Grange had spoken with a dramatic\nintensity of which Skelton would never have thought her capable. Her\ncoarse irony was as painful as her anguish. Skelton was young, he was\nnot yet thirty, and he did not know how to deal with the difficult\nsituation. But he could not keep silent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Grange. I wish I could do something to help\nyou.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not asking for your help. No one can help me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSkelton was distressed. From what she said he could not but suspect that\nshe had been concerned in a mysterious and perhaps dreadful occurrence,\nand it might be that to tell him about it without fear of the\nconsequences was just the relief she needed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want to butt into what's no business of mine, but, Mrs. Grange,\nif you think it would ease your mind to tell me--what you were referring\nto just now, I mean what you said was a damned funny business, I promise\nyou on my word of honour that I'll never repeat it to a living soul.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe stopped crying quite suddenly and gave him a long, intent look. She\nhesitated. He had an impression that the desire to speak was almost\nirresistible. But she shook her head and sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It wouldn't do any good. Nothing can do me any good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe got up and abruptly left him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe two men sat down to brunch by themselves.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My wife asks you to excuse her,\" said Grange. \"She's got one of her\nsick headaches and she's staying in bed to-day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I'm sorry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSkelton had a notion that in the searching look that Grange gave him was\nmistrust and animosity. It flashed through his mind that somehow he had\ndiscovered that Mrs. Grange had been talking to him and perhaps had said\nthings that should have been left unsaid. Skelton made an effort at\nconversation, but his host was taciturn, and they ended the meal in a\nsilence that was only broken by Grange when he got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You seem pretty fit to-day and I don't suppose you want to stay in this\nGod-forsaken place longer than you must. I've sent over the river to\narrange for a couple of prahus to take you down to the coast. They'll be\nhere at six to-morrow morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSkelton felt sure then that he was right; Grange knew or guessed that\nhis wife had spoken too freely, and he wanted to be rid as soon as\npossible of the dangerous visitor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's terribly kind of you,\" Skelton answered, smiling. \"I'm as fit as\na fiddle.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut in Grange's eyes was no answering smile. They were coldly hostile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We might have another game of chess later on,\" said he.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right. When d'you get back from your office?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't got much to do there to-day. I shall be about the house.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSkelton wondered if it were only his fancy that there was something very\nlike a threat in the tone in which Grange uttered these words. It looked\nas though he were going to make sure that his wife and Skelton should\nnot again be left alone. Mrs. Grange did not come to dinner. They drank\ntheir coffee and smoked their cheroots. Then Grange, pushing back his\nchair, said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got to make an early start to-morrow. I daresay you'd like to\nturn in. I shall have started out on my round by the time you go, so\nI'll say good-bye to you now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me get my guns. I want you to take the one you like best.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll tell the boy to fetch them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe guns were brought and Grange made his choice. He gave no sign that\nhe was pleased with the handsome gift.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You quite understand that this gun's worth a damned sight more than\nwhat your food and drink and smoke have run me into?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For all I know you saved my life. I don't think an old gun is an\nover-generous return for that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, well, if you like to look at it that way, I suppose it's your own\nbusiness. Thank you very much all the same.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey shook hands and parted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext morning, while the baggage was being stowed away in the prahus,\nSkelton asked the house boy whether, before starting, he could say\ngood-bye to Mrs. Grange. The house boy said he would go and see. He\nwaited a little while. Mrs. Grange came out of her room on to the\nverandah. She was wearing a pink dressing-gown, shabby, rumpled and none\ntoo clean, of Japanese silk, heavily trimmed with cheap lace. The powder\nwas thick on her face, her cheeks were rouged and her lips scarlet with\nlipstick. Her head seemed to twitch more violently than usual and her\nhand was agitated by that strange gesture. When first Skelton saw it he\nhad thought that it suggested a wish to call attention to something\nbehind her back, but now, after what she had told him yesterday, it did\nindeed look as though she were constantly trying to brush something off\nher dress. Blood, she had said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't want to go without thanking you for all your kindness to me,\"\nhe said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, that's all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, good-bye.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll walk down with you to the landing-stage.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey hadn't far to go. The boatmen were still arranging the luggage.\nSkelton looked across the river where you could see some native houses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose these men come from over there. It looks quite a village.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, only those few houses. There used to be a rubber estate there, but\nthe company went broke and it was abandoned.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you ever go over there?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Me?\" cried Mrs. Grange. Her voice rose shrill and her head, her hand,\nwere on a sudden convulsed by a paroxysm of involuntary movement. \"No.\nWhy should I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSkelton could not imagine why that simple question, asked merely for\nsomething to say, should so greatly upset her. But by now all was in\norder and he shook hands with her. He stepped into the boat and\ncomfortably settled down. They pushed off. He waved to Mrs. Grange. As\nthe boat slid into the current she cried out with a harsh, strident\nscream:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give my regards to Leicester Square.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSkelton heaved a great sigh of relief as with their powerful strokes the\npaddlers took him farther and farther away from that dreadful house and\nfrom those two unhappy and yet repellent people. He was glad now that\nMrs. Grange had not told him the story that was on the tip of her tongue\nto tell. He did not want some tragic tale of sin or folly to connect him\nwith them in a recollection that he could not escape. He wanted to\nforget them as one forgets a bad dream.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Mrs. Grange watched the two prahus till a bend of the river took\nthem out of sight. She walked slowly up to the house and went into her\nbedroom. The light was dim because the blinds were drawn to keep out the\nheat, but she sat down at her dressing-table and stared at herself in\nthe glass. Norman had had the dressing-table made for her soon after\nthey were married. It had been made by a native carpenter, of course,\nand they had had the mirror sent from Singapore, but it was made to her\nown design, of the exact size and shape she wanted, with plenty of room\nfor all her toilet things and her make-up. It was the dressing-table she\nhad hankered after for donkey's years and had never had. She remembered\nstill how pleased she was when first she had it. She threw her arms\nround her husband's neck and kissed him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Norman, you are good to me,\" she said. \"I'm a lucky little girl to\nhave caught a chap like you, aren't I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut then everything delighted her. She was amused by the river life and\nthe life of the jungle, the teeming growth of the forest, the birds with\ntheir gay plumage and the brilliant butterflies. She set about giving\nthe house a woman's touch; she put out all her own photographs and she\ngot vases to put flowers in; she routed around and got a lot of\nknick-knacks to place here and there. \"They make a room look homey,\" she\nsaid. She wasn't in love with Norman, but she liked him all right; and\nit was lovely to be married; it was lovely to have nothing to do from\nmorning till night, except play the gramophone, or patience, and read\nnovels. It was lovely to think one hadn't got to bother about one's\nfuture. Of course it was a bit lonely sometimes, but Norman said she'd\nget used to that, and he'd promised that in a year, or two at the\noutside, he'd take her to England for three months. It would be a lark\nto show him off to her friends. She felt that what had caught him was\nthe glamour of the stage and she'd made herself out a good deal more\nsuccessful than she really had been. She wanted him to realise that\nshe'd made a sacrifice when she'd thrown up her career to become a\nplanter's wife. She'd claimed acquaintance with a good many stars that\nin point of fact she'd never even spoken to. That would need a bit of\nhandling when they went home, but she'd manage it; after all, poor\nNorman knew no more about the stage than a babe unborn, if she couldn't\ncod a simple fellow like that, after twelve years on the stage, well,\nshe'd wasted her time, that's all she could say. Things went all right\nthe first year. At one moment she thought she was going to have a baby.\nThey were both disappointed when it turned out not to be true. Then she\nbegan to grow bored. It seemed to her that she'd done the same damned\nthing day after day for ever and it frightened her to think that she'd\nhave to go on doing the same damned thing day after day for ever more.\nNorman said he couldn't leave the plantation that year. They had a bit\nof a scene. It was then that he'd said something that scared her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hate England,\" he said. \"If I had my way I'd never set foot in the\ndamned country again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLiving this lonely life Mrs. Grange got into the habit of talking out\nloud to herself. Shut up in her room she could be heard chattering away\nhour after hour; and now, dipping the puff in her powder and plastering\nher face with it, she addressed her reflection in the mirror exactly as\nthough she were talking to another person.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That ought to have warned me. I should have insisted on going by\nmyself, and who knows, I might have got a job when I got to London. With\nall the experience I had and everything. Then I'd have written to him\nand said I wasn't coming back.\" Her thoughts turned to Skelton. \"Pity I\ndidn't tell him,\" she continued. \"I had half a mind to. P'raps he was\nright, p'raps it would have eased me mind. I wonder what he'd have\nsaid.\" She imitated his Oxford accent. \"I'm so terribly sorry, Mrs.\nGrange. I wish I could help you.\" She gave a chuckle which was almost a\nsob. \"I'd have liked to tell him about Jack. Oh, Jack.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was when they had been married for two years that they got a\nneighbour. The price of rubber at that time was so high that new estates\nwere being put under cultivation and one of the big companies had bought\na great tract of land on the opposite bank of the river. It was a rich\ncompany and everything was done on a lavish scale. The manager they had\nput in had a launch at his disposal so that it was no trouble for him to\npop over and have a drink whenever he felt inclined. Jack Carr his name\nwas. He was quite a different sort of chap from Norman; for one thing he\nwas a gentleman, he'd been to a public school and a university; he was\nabout thirty-five, tall, not beefy like Norman, but slight, he had the\nsort of figure that looked lovely in evening dress; and he had crisply\ncurling hair and a laughing look in his eyes. Just her type. She took to\nhim at once. It was a treat, having someone you could talk about London\nto, and the theatre. He was gay and easy. He made the sort of jokes you\ncould understand. In a week or two she felt more at home with him than\nshe did with her husband after two years. There had always been\nsomething about Norman that she hadn't quite been able to get to the\nbottom of. He was crazy about her, of course, and he'd told her a lot\nabout himself, but she had a funny feeling that there was something he\nkept from her, not because he wanted to, but--well, you couldn't hardly\nexplain it, because it was so alien, you might say, that he couldn't put\nit into words. Later, when she knew Jack better, she mentioned it to\nhim, and Jack said it was because he was country-born; even though he\nhadn't a drop of native blood in his veins, something of the country had\ngone to the making of him so that he wasn't white really; he had an\nEastern streak in him. However hard he tried he could never be quite\nEnglish.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe chattered away aloud, in that empty house, for the two boys, the\ncook and the house boy, were in their own quarters, and the sound of her\nvoice, ringing along the wooden floors, piercing the wooden walls, was\nlike the uncanny, unhuman gibber of new wine fermenting in a vat. She\nspoke just as though Skelton were there, but so incoherently that if he\nhad been, he would have had difficulty in following the story she told.\nIt did not take her long to discover that Jack Carr wanted her. She was\nexcited. She'd never been promiscuous, but in all those years she'd been\non the stage naturally there'd been episodes. You couldn't hardly have\nput up with being on tour month after month if you didn't have a bit of\nfun sometimes. Of course now she wasn't going to give in too easily, she\ndidn't want to make herself cheap, but what with the life she led, she'd\nbe a fool if she missed the chance; and as far as Norman was concerned,\nwell, what the eye didn't see the heart didn't grieve over. They\nunderstood one another all right, Jack and her; they knew it was bound\nto happen sooner or later, it was only a matter of waiting for the\nopportunity; and the opportunity came. But then something happened that\nthey hadn't bargained for: they fell madly in love with one another. If\nMrs. Grange really had been telling the story to Skelton it might have\nseemed as unlikely to him as it did to them. They were two very ordinary\npeople, he a jolly, good-natured, commonplace planter, and she a\nsmall-part actress far from clever, not even very young, with nothing to\nrecommend her but a neat figure and a prettyish face. What started as a\ncasual affair turned without warning into a devastating passion, and\nneither of them was of a texture to sustain its exorbitant compulsion.\nThey longed to be with one another; they were restless and miserable\napart. She'd been finding Norman a bore for some time, but she'd put up\nwith him because he was her husband; now he irritated her to frenzy\nbecause he stood between her and Jack. There was no question of their\ngoing off together, Jack Carr had nothing but his salary, and he\ncouldn't throw up a job he'd been only too glad to get. It was difficult\nfor them to meet. They had to run awful risks. Perhaps the chances they\nhad to take, the obstacles they had to surmount, were fuel to their\nlove; a year passed and it was as overwhelming as at the beginning; it\nwas a year of agony and bliss, of fear and thrill. Then she discovered\nthat she was pregnant. She had no doubt that Jack Carr was the father\nand she was wildly happy. It was true life was difficult, so difficult\nsometimes that she felt she just couldn't cope with it, but there'd be a\nbaby, his baby, and that would make everything easy. She was going to\nKuching for her confinement. It happened about then that Jack Carr had\nto go to Singapore on business and was to be away for several weeks; but\nhe promised to get back before she left and he said he'd send word by a\nnative the moment he arrived. When at last the message came she felt\nsick with the anguish of her joy. She had never wanted him so badly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hear that Jack is back,\" she told her husband at dinner. \"I shall go\nover to-morrow morning and get the things he promised to bring me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't do that. He's pretty sure to drop in towards sundown and\nhe'll bring them himself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't wait. I'm crazy to have them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right. Have it your own way.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe couldn't help talking about him. For some time now they had seemed\nto have little to say to one another, Norman and she, but that night, in\nhigh spirits, she chattered away as she had done during the first months\nof their marriage. She always rose early, at six, and next morning she\nwent down to the river and had a bathe. There was a little dent in the\nbank just there, with a tiny sandy beach, and it was delicious to splash\nabout in the cool, transparent water. A kingfisher stood on the branch\nof a tree overhanging the pool and its reflection was brilliantly blue\nin the water. Lovely. She had a cup of tea and then stepped into a\ndug-out. A boy paddled her across the river. It took a good half-hour.\nAs they got near she scanned the bank; Jack knew she would come at the\nearliest opportunity; he must be on the lookout. Ah, there he was. The\ndelicious pain in her heart was almost unbearable. He came down to the\nlanding-stage and helped her to get out of the boat. They walked hand in\nhand up the pathway and when they were out of sight of the boy who had\npaddled her over and of prying eyes from the house, they stopped. He put\nhis arms round her and she yielded with ecstasy to his embrace. She\nclung to him. His mouth sought hers. In that kiss was all the agony of\ntheir separation and all the bliss of their reunion. The miracle of love\ntransfused them so that they were unconscious of time and place. They\nwere not human any more, but two spirits united by a divine fire. No\nthought passed through their minds. No words issued from their lips.\nSuddenly there was a brutal shock, like a blow, and immediately, almost\nsimultaneously, a deafening noise. Horrified, not understanding, she\nclung to Jack more tightly and his grip on her was spasmodic, so that\nshe gasped; then she felt that he was bearing her over.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Jack.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe tried to hold him up. His weight was too great for her and as he\nfell to the ground she fell with him. Then she gave a great cry, for she\nfelt a gush of heat, and his blood sputtered over her. She began to\nscream. A rough hand seized her and dragged her to her feet. It was\nNorman. She was distraught. She could not understand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Norman, what have you done?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've killed him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe stared at him stupidly. She pushed him aside.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Jack. Jack.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shut up. I'll go and get help. It was an accident.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe walked quickly up the pathway. She fell to her knees and took Jack's\nhead in her arms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Darling,\" she moaned. \"Oh, my darling.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNorman came back with some coolies and they carried him up to the house.\nThat night she had a miscarriage and was so ill that for days it looked\nas if she would die. When she recovered she had the nervous tic that\nshe'd had ever since. She expected that Norman would send her away; but\nhe didn't, he had to keep her to allay suspicion. There was some talk\namong the natives, and after a while the District Officer came up and\nasked a lot of questions; but the natives were frightened of Norman, and\nthe D.O. could get nothing out of them. The Dyak boy who paddled her\nover had vanished. Norman said something had gone wrong with his gun and\nJack was looking at it to see what was the matter and it went off. They\nbury people quickly in that country and by the time they might have dug\nhim up there wouldn't have been much left to show that Norman's story\nwasn't true. The D.O. hadn't been satisfied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It all looks damned fishy to me,\" he said, \"but in the absence of any\nevidence, I suppose I must accept your version.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe would have given anything to get away, but with that nervous\naffliction she had no ghost of a chance any longer of earning a living.\nShe had to stay--or starve; and Norman had to keep her--or hang. Nothing\nhad happened since then and now nothing ever would happen. The endless\nyears one after another dragged out their weary length.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Grange on a sudden stopped talking. Her sharp ears had caught the\nsound of a footstep on the path and she knew that Norman was back from\nhis round. Her head twitching furiously, her hand agitated by that\nsinister, uncontrollable gesture, she looked in the untidy mess of her\ndressing-table for her precious lipstick. She smeared it on her lips,\nand then, she didn't know why, on a freakish impulse daubed it all over\nher nose till she looked like a red-nose comedian in a music-hall. She\nlooked at herself in the glass and burst out laughing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To hell with life!\" she shouted.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI had known the Blands a long time before I discovered that they had any\nconnection with Ferdy Rabenstein. Ferdy must have been nearly fifty when\nI first knew him and at the time of which I write he was well over\nseventy. He had altered little. His hair, coarse but abundant and curly,\nwas white, but he had kept his figure and held himself as gallantly as\never. It was not hard to believe that in youth he had been as beautiful\nas people said. He had still his fine Semitic profile and the lustrous\nblack eyes that had caused havoc in so many a Gentile breast. He was\nvery tall, lean, with an oval face and a clear skin. He wore his clothes\nvery well and in evening dress, even now, he was one of the handsomest\nmen I had ever seen. He wore then large black pearls in his shirt-front\nand platinum and sapphire rings on his fingers. Perhaps he was rather\nflashy, but you felt it was so much in character that it would have ill\nbecome him to be anything else.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After all, I am an Oriental,\" he said. \"I can carry a certain barbaric\nmagnificence.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI have often thought that Ferdy Rabenstein would make an admirable\nsubject for a biography. He was not a great man, but within the limits\nhe set himself he made of his life a work of art. It was a masterpiece\nin little, like a Persian miniature, and derived its interest from its\nperfection. Unfortunately the materials are scanty. They would consist\nof letters that may very well have been destroyed and the recollections\nof people who are old now and will soon be dead. His memory is\nextraordinary, but he would never write his memoirs, for he looks upon\nhis past as a source of purely private entertainment; and he is a man of\nthe most perfect discretion. Nor do I know anyone who could do justice\nto the subject but Max Beerbohm. There is no one else in this hard world\nof to-day who can look upon the trivial with such tender sympathy and\nwring such a delicate pathos from futility. I wonder that Max, who must\nhave known Ferdy much better than I, and long before, was never tempted\nto exercise his exquisite fancy on such a theme. He was born for Max to\nwrite about. And who should have illustrated the elegant book that I see\nin my mind's eye but Aubrey Beardsley? Thus would have been erected a\nmonument of triple brass and the ephemera imprisoned to succeeding ages\nin the amber's translucency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFerdy's conquests were social and his venue was the great world. He was\nborn in South Africa and did not come to England till he was twenty. For\nsome time he was on the Stock Exchange, but on the death of his father\nhe inherited a considerable fortune, and retiring from business devoted\nhimself to the life of a man about town. At that period English society\nwas still a closed body and it was not easy for a Jew to force its\nbarriers, but to Ferdy they fell like the walls of Jericho. He was\nhandsome, he was rich, he was a sportsman and he was good company. He\nhad a house in Curzon Street, furnished with the most beautiful French\nfurniture, and a French chef, and a brougham. It would be interesting to\nknow the first steps in his wonderful career: they are lost in the dark\nabysm of time. When I first met him he had been long established as one\nof the smartest men in London: this was at a very grand house in Norfolk\nto which I had been asked as a promising young novelist by the hostess\nwho took an interest in letters, but the company was very distinguished\nand I was overawed. We were sixteen, and I felt shy and alone among\nthese Cabinet Ministers, great ladies and peers of the realm who talked\nof people and things of which I knew nothing. They were civil to me, but\nindifferent, and I was conscious that I was somewhat of a burden to my\nhostess. Ferdy saved me. He sat with me, walked with me and talked with\nme. He discovered that I was a writer and we discussed the drama and the\nnovel; he learnt that I had lived much on the Continent and he talked to\nme pleasantly of France, Germany and Spain. He seemed really to seek my\nsociety. He gave me the flattering impression that he and I stood apart\nfrom the other members of the company and by our conversation upon\naffairs of the spirit made that of the rest of them, the political\nsituation, the scandal of somebody's divorce and the growing\ndisinclination of pheasants to be killed, seem a little ridiculous. But\nif Ferdy had at the bottom of his heart a feeling of ever so faint a\ncontempt for the hearty British gentry that surrounded us I am sure that\nit was only to me that he allowed an inkling of it to appear, and\nlooking back I cannot but wonder whether it was not after all a suave\nand very delicate compliment that he paid me. I think of course that he\nliked to exercise his charm and I dare say the obvious pleasure his\nconversation gave me gratified him, but he could have had no motive for\ntaking so much trouble over an obscure novelist other than his real\ninterest in art and letters. I felt that he and I at bottom were equally\nalien in that company, I because I was a writer and he because he was a\nJew, but I envied the ease with which he bore himself. He was completely\nat home. Everyone called him Ferdy. He seemed to be always in good\nspirits. He was never at a loss for a quip, a jest or a repartee. They\nliked him in that house because he made them laugh, but never made them\nuncomfortable by talking over their heads. He brought a faint savour of\nOriental romance into their lives, but so cleverly that they only felt\nmore English. You could never be dull when he was by and with him\npresent you were safe from the fear of the devastating silences that\nsometimes overwhelm a British company. A pause looked inevitable and\nFerdy Rabenstein had broken into a topic that interested everyone. An\ninvaluable asset to any party. He had an inexhaustible fund of Jewish\nstories. He was a very good mimic and he assumed the Yiddish accent and\nreproduced the Jewish gestures to perfection; his head sank into his\nbody, his face grew cunning, his voice oily, and he was a rabbi or an\nold clothes merchant or a smart commercial traveller or a fat procuress\nin Frankfort. It was as good as a play. Because he was himself a Jew and\ninsisted on it you laughed without reserve, but for my own part not\nwithout an under-current of discomfort. I was not quite sure of a sense\nof humour that made such cruel fun of his own race. I discovered\nafterwards that Jewish stories were his speciality and I seldom met him\nanywhere without hearing him tell sooner or later the last he had heard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the best story he told me on this occasion was not a Jewish one. It\nstruck me so that I have never forgotten it, but for one reason or\nanother I have never had occasion to tell it again. I give it here\nbecause it is a curious little incident concerning persons whose names\nat least will live in the social history of the Victorian Era and I\nthink it would be a pity if it were lost. He told me then that once when\nquite a young man he was staying in the country in a house where Mrs.\nLangtry, at that time at the height of her beauty and astounding\nreputation, was also a guest. It happened to be within driving distance\nof that in which lived the Duchess of Somerset, who had been Queen of\nBeauty at the Eglinton Tournament, and knowing her slightly, it occurred\nto him that it would be interesting to bring the two women together. He\nsuggested it to Mrs. Langtry, who was willing, and forthwith wrote to\nthe Duchess asking if he might bring the celebrated beauty to call on\nher. It was fitting, he said, that the loveliest woman of this\ngeneration (this was in the 'eighties) should pay her respects to the\nloveliest woman of the last. \"Bring her by all means,\" answered the\nDuchess, \"but I warn you that it will be a shock to her.\" They drove\nover in a carriage and pair, Mrs. Langtry in a close-fitting blue bonnet\nwith long satin strings, which showed the fine shape of her head and\nmade her blue eyes even bluer, and were received by a little ugly old\nhag who looked with irony out of her beady eyes at the radiant beauty\nwho had come to see her. They had tea, they talked and they drove home\nagain. Mrs. Langtry was very silent and when Ferdy looked at her he saw\nthat she was quietly weeping. When they got back to the house she went\nto her room and would not come down to dinner that night. For the first\ntime she had realised that beauty dies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFerdy asked me for my address and a few days after I got back to London\ninvited me to dinner. There were only six of us, an American woman\nmarried to an English peer, a Swedish painter, an actress and a\nwell-known critic. We ate very good food and drank excellent wine. The\nconversation was easy and intelligent. After dinner Ferdy was persuaded\nto play the piano. He only played Viennese waltzes, I discovered later\nthat they were his speciality, and the light, tuneful and sensual music\nseemed to accord well with his discreet flamboyance. He played without\naffectation, with a lilt, and he had a graceful touch. This was the\nfirst of a good many dinners I had with him, he would ask me two or\nthree times a year, and as time passed I met him more and more\nfrequently at other people's houses. I rose in the world and perhaps he\ncame down a little. Of late years I had sometimes found him at parties\nwhere other Jews were and I fancied that I read in his shining liquid\neyes, resting for a moment on these members of his race, a certain\ngood-natured amusement at the thought of what the world was coming to.\nThere were people who said he was a snob, but I do not think he was; it\njust happened that in his early days he had never met any but the great.\nHe had a real passion for art and in his commerce with those that\nproduced it was at his best. With them he had never that faint air of\npersiflage which when he was with very grand persons made you suspect\nthat he was never quite the dupe of their grandeur. His taste was\nperfect and many of his friends were glad to avail themselves of his\nknowledge. He was one of the first to value old furniture and he rescued\nmany a priceless piece from the attics of ancestral mansions and gave it\nan honourable place in the drawing-room. It amused him to saunter round\nthe auction rooms and he was always willing to give his advice to great\nladies who desired at once to acquire a beautiful thing and make a\nprofitable investment. He was rich and good-natured. He liked to\npatronise the arts and would take a great deal of trouble to get\ncommissions for some young painter whose talent he admired or an\nengagement to play at a rich man's house for a violinist who could in no\nother way get a hearing. But he never let his rich man down. His taste\nwas too good to deceive and civil though he might be to the mediocre he\nwould not lift a finger to help them. His own musical parties, very\nsmall and carefully chosen, were a treat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe never married.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am a man of the world,\" he said, \"and I flatter myself that I have no\nprejudices, <i>tous les goûts sont dans la nature</i>, but I do not think I\ncould bring myself to marry a Gentile. There's no harm in going to the\nopera in a dinner jacket, but it just would never occur to me to do so.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then why didn't you marry a Jewess?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n(I did not hear this conversation, but the lively and audacious creature\nwho thus tackled him told me of it.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my dear, our women are so prolific. I could not bear the thought of\npeopling the world with a little Ikey and a little Jacob and a little\nRebecca and a little Leah and a little Rachel.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he had had affairs of note and the glamour of past romance still\nclung to him. He was in his youth of an amorous complexion. I have met\nold ladies who told me that he was irresistible, and when in reminiscent\nmood they talked to me of this woman and that who had completely lost\nher head over him, I divined that, such was his beauty, they could not\nfind it in their hearts to blame them. It was interesting to hear of\ngreat ladies that I had read of in the memoirs of the day or had met as\nrespectable dowagers garrulous over their grandsons at Eton or making a\nmess of a hand at bridge and bethink myself that they had been consumed\nwith sinful passion for the handsome Jew. Ferdy's most notorious amour\nwas with the Duchess of Hereford, the loveliest, the most gallant and\ndashing of the beauties of the end of Queen Victoria's reign. It lasted\nfor twenty years. He had doubtless flirtations meanwhile, but their\nrelations were stable and recognised. It was proof of his marvellous\ntact that when at last they ended he exchanged an ageing mistress for a\nloyal friend. I remember meeting the pair not so very long ago at\nluncheon. She was an old woman, tall and of a commanding presence, but\nwith a mask of paint on a ravaged face. We were lunching at the Carlton\nand Ferdy, our host, came a few minutes late. He offered us a cocktail\nand the Duchess told him we had already had one.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, I wondered why your eyes were so doubly bright,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe old raddled woman flushed with pleasure.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy youth passed, I grew middle-aged, I wondered how soon I must begin to\ndescribe myself as elderly; I wrote books and plays, I travelled, I\nunderwent experiences, I fell in love and out of it; and still I kept\nmeeting Ferdy at parties. War broke out and was waged, millions of men\nwere killed and the face of the world was changed. Ferdy did not like\nthe war. He was too old to take part in it, and his German name was\nawkward, but he was discreet and took care not to expose himself to\nhumiliation. His old friends were faithful to him and he lived in a\ndignified but not too strict seclusion. But then peace came and with\ncourage he set himself to making the best of changed conditions. Society\nwas mixed now, parties were rowdy, but Ferdy fitted himself to the new\nlife. He still told his funny Jewish stories, he still played charmingly\nthe waltzes of Strauss, he still went round auction rooms and told the\nnew rich what they ought to buy. I went to live abroad, but whenever I\nwas in London I saw Ferdy and now there was something a little uncanny\nin him. He did not give in. He had never known a day's illness. He\nseemed never to grow tired. He still dressed beautifully. He was\ninterested in everybody. His mind was alert and people asked him to\ndinner, not for old times' sake, but because he was worth his salt. He\nstill gave charming little concerts at his house in Curzon Street.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was when he invited me to one of these that I made the discovery that\nstarted the recollections of him I have here set down. We were dining at\na house in Hill Street, a large party, and the women having gone\nupstairs Ferdy and I found ourselves side by side. He told me that Lea\nMakart was coming to play for him on the following Friday evening and he\nwould be glad if I would come.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm awfully sorry,\" I said, \"but I'm going down to the Blands.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What Blands?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They live in Sussex at a place called Tilby.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know you knew them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at me rather strangely. He smiled. I didn't know what amused\nhim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, yes, I've known them for years. It's a very nice house to stay at.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Adolph is my nephew.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sir Adolphus?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It suggests one of the bucks of the Regency, doesn't it? But I will not\nconceal from you that he was named Adolf.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Everyone I know calls him Freddy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know, and I understand that Miriam, his wife, only answers to the\nname of Muriel.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How does he happen to be your nephew?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Because Hannah Rabenstein, my sister, married Alfons Bleikogel, who\nended life as Sir Alfred Bland, first Baronet, and Adolf, their only\nson, in due course became Sir Adolphus Bland, second Baronet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then Freddy Bland's mother, the Lady Bland who lives in Portland Place,\nis your sister?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, my sister Hannah. She was the eldest of the family. She's eighty,\nbut in full possession of her faculties and a remarkable woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've never met her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think your friends the Blands would just as soon you didn't. She has\nnever lost her German accent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you never see them?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't spoken to them for twenty years. I am such a Jew and they are\nso English.\" He smiled. \"I could never remember that their names were\nFreddy and Muriel. I used to come out with an Adolf or a Miriam at\nawkward moments. And they didn't like my stories. It was better that we\nshould not meet. When the war broke out and I would not change my name\nit was the last straw. It was too late, I could never have accustomed my\nfriends to think of me as anything but Ferdy Rabenstein; I was quite\ncontent. I was not ambitious to be a Smith, a Brown or a Robinson.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThough he spoke facetiously, there was in his tone the faintest possible\nderision and I felt, hardly felt even, the sensation was so shadowy,\nthat, as it had often vaguely seemed to me before, there was in the\ndepth of his impenetrable heart a cynical contempt for the Gentiles he\nhad conquered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then you don't know the two boys?\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The eldest is called George, you know. I don't think he's so clever as\nHarry, the other one, but he's an engaging youth. I think you'd like\nhim.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where is he now?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, he's just been sent down from Oxford. I suppose he's at home.\nHarry's still at Eton.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why don't you bring George to lunch with me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll ask him. I should think he'd love to come.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It has reached my ears that he's been a little troublesome.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I don't know. He wouldn't go into the army, which is what they\nwanted. They rather fancied the Guards. And so he went to Oxford\ninstead. He didn't work and he spent a great deal of money and he\npainted the town red. It was all quite normal.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What was he sent down for?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. Nothing of any consequence.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment our host rose and we went upstairs. When Ferdy bade me\ngood-night he asked me not to forget about his great-nephew.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ring me up,\" he said. \"Wednesday would suit me. Or Friday.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext day I went down to Tilby. It was an Elizabethan mansion standing in\na spacious park, in which roamed fallow deer, and from its windows you\nhad wide views of rolling downs. It seemed to me that as far as the eye\ncould reach the land belonged to the Blands. His tenants must have found\nSir Adolphus a wonderful landlord, for I never saw farms kept in such\norder, the barns and cow-sheds were spick and span and the pigsties were\na picture; the public-houses looked like old English water-colours and\nthe cottages he had built on the estate combined admirably\npicturesqueness and convenience. It must have cost him a pot of money to\nrun the place on these lines. Fortunately he had it. The park with its\ngrand old trees (and its nine-hole golf course) was tended like a\ngarden, and the wide-stretching gardens were the pride of the\nneighbourhood. The magnificent house, with its steep roofs and mullioned\nwindows, had been restored by the most celebrated architect in England\nand furnished by Lady Bland, with taste and knowledge, in a style that\nperfectly fitted it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course it's very simple,\" she said. \"Just an English house in the\ncountry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe dining-room was adorned with old English sporting pictures and the\nChippendale chairs were of incredible value. In the drawing-room were\nportraits by Reynolds and Gainsborough and landscapes by Old Crome and\nRichard Wilson. Even in my bedroom with its four-post bed were\nwater-colours by Birket Foster. It was very beautiful and a treat to\nstay there, but though it would have distressed Muriel Bland beyond\nanything to know it, it entirely missed oddly enough the effect she had\nsought. It did not give you for a moment the impression of an English\nhouse. You had the feeling that every object had been bought with a\ncareful eye to the general scheme. You missed the dull Academy portraits\nthat hung in the dining-room beside a Carlo Dolci that an ancestor had\nbrought back from the grand tour, and the water-colours painted by a\ngreat-aunt that cluttered up the drawing-room so engagingly. There was\nno ugly Victorian sofa that had always been there and that it never\noccurred to anybody to take away and no needlework chairs that an\nunmarried daughter had so painstakingly worked at about the time of the\nGreat Exhibition. There was beauty but no sentiment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd yet how comfortable it was and how well looked after you were! And\nwhat a cordial greeting the Blands gave you! They seemed really to like\npeople. They were generous and kindly. They were never happier than when\nthey were entertaining the county, and though they had not owned the\nproperty for more than twenty years they had established themselves\nfirmly in the favour of their neighbours. Except perhaps in their\nsplendour and the competent way in which the estate was run there was\nnothing to suggest that they had not been settled there for centuries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFreddy had been at Eton and Oxford. He was now in the early fifties. He\nwas quiet in manner, courtly, very clever, I imagine, but a trifle\nreserved. He had great elegance, but it was not an English elegance; he\nhad grey hair and a short pointed grey beard, fine dark eyes and an\naquiline nose. He was just above middle height; I don't think you would\nhave taken him for a Jew, but rather for a foreign diplomat of some\ndistinction. He was a man of character, but gave you, strangely enough,\nnotwithstanding the success he had had in life, an impression of faint\nmelancholy. His successes had been financial and political; in the world\nof sport, for all his perseverance, he had never shone. For many years\nhe had followed hounds, but he was a bad rider and I think it must have\nbeen a relief to him when he could persuade himself that middle age and\npressure of business forced him to give up hunting. He had excellent\nshooting and gave grand parties for it, but he was a poor shot; and\ndespite the course in his park he never succeeded in being more than an\nindifferent golfer. He knew only too well how much these things meant in\nEngland and his incapacity was a bitter disappointment to him. However\nGeorge would make up for it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge was scratch at golf, and though tennis was not his game he played\nmuch better than the average; the Blands had had him taught to shoot as\nsoon as he was old enough to hold a gun and he was a fine shot; they had\nput him on a pony when he was two and Freddy, watching him mount his\nhorse, knew that out hunting when the boy came to a fence he felt\nexhilaration and not that sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach\nwhich, though he had chased the fox with such grim determination, had\nalways made the sport a torture to him. George was so tall and slim, his\ncurly hair, of a palish brown, was so fine, his eyes were so blue, he\nwas the perfect type of the young Englishman. He had the engaging\ncandour of the breed. His nose was straight, though perhaps a trifle\nfleshy, and his lips were perhaps a little full and sensual, but he had\nbeautiful teeth, and his smooth skin was like ivory. George was the\napple of his father's eye. He did not like Harry, his second son, so\nwell. He was rather stocky, broad-shouldered and strong for his age, but\nhis black eyes, shining with cleverness, his coarse dark hair and his\nbig nose revealed his race. Freddy was severe with him, and often\nimpatient, but with George he was all indulgence. Harry would go into\nthe business, he had brains and push, but George was the heir. George\nwould be an English gentleman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge had offered to motor me down in the roadster his father had given\nhim as a birthday present. He drove very fast and we arrived before the\nrest of the guests. The Blands were sitting on the lawn and tea was laid\nout under a magnificent cedar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way,\" I said presently, \"I saw Ferdy Rabenstein the other day\nand he wants me to bring George to lunch with him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had not mentioned the invitation to George on the way because I\nthought that if there had been a family coldness I had better address\nhis parents as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who in God's name is Ferdy Rabenstein?\" said George.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHow brief is human glory! A generation back such a question would have\nseemed grotesque.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's by way of being your great-uncle,\" I replied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA glance had passed from father to mother when I first spoke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's a horrid old man,\" said Muriel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think it's in the least necessary for George to resume\nrelationships that were definitely severed before he was born,\" said\nFreddy with decision.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Anyhow I've delivered the message,\" said I, feeling somewhat snubbed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want to see the old blighter,\" said George.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe conversation was broken off by the arrival of other guests and in a\nlittle while George went off to play golf with one of his Oxford\nfriends.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was not till next day that the matter was referred to again. I had\nplayed an unsatisfactory round with Freddy Bland in the morning and\nseveral sets of what is known as country-house tennis in the afternoon\nand was sitting alone with Muriel on the terrace. In England we have so\nmuch bad weather that it is only fair that a beautiful day should be\nmore beautiful than anywhere in the world and this June evening was\nperfect. The blue sky was cloudless and the air was balmy; before us\nstretched green rolling downs, and woods, and in the distance you saw\nthe red roofs of a little village church. It was a day when to be alive\nwas sufficient happiness. Detached lines of poetry hovered vaguely in my\nmemory. Muriel and I had been chatting desultorily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope you didn't think it rather horrid of us to refuse to let George\nlunch with Ferdy,\" she said suddenly. \"He's such a fearful snob, isn't\nhe?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you think so? He's always been very nice to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We haven't been on speaking terms for twenty years. Freddy never\nforgave him for his behaviour during the war. So unpatriotic, I thought,\nand one really must draw the line somewhere. You know, he absolutely\nrefused to drop his horrible German name. With Freddy in Parliament and\nrunning munitions and all that sort of thing it was quite impossible. I\ndon't know why he should want to see George. He can't mean anything to\nhim.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's an old man. George and Harry are his great-nephews. He must leave\nhis money to someone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'd rather not have his money,\" said Muriel coldly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course I didn't care a row of pins whether George went to lunch with\nFerdy Rabenstein, and I was quite willing to let the matter drop, but\nevidently the Elands had talked it over and Muriel felt that some\nexplanation was due to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course you know that Freddy has Jewish blood in him,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at me sharply. Muriel was rather a big blonde woman and she\nspent a great deal of time trying to keep down the corpulence to which\nshe was predisposed. She had been very pretty when young and even now\nwas a comely person; but her round blue eyes, slightly prominent, her\nfleshy nose, the shape of her face and the back of her neck, her\nexuberant manner, betrayed her race. No Englishwoman, however\nfair-haired, ever looked like that. And yet her observation was designed\nto make me take it for granted that she was a Gentile. I answered\ndiscreetly:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So many people have nowadays.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know. But there's no reason to dwell on it, is there? After all,\nwe're absolutely English; no one could be more English than George, in\nappearance and manner and everything; I mean, he's such a fine sportsman\nand all that sort of thing, I can't see any object in his knowing Jews\njust because they happen to be distant connections of his.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's very difficult in England now not to know Jews, isn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I know, in London one does meet a good many, and I think some of\nthem are very nice. They're so artistic. I don't go so far as to say\nthat Freddy and I deliberately avoid them, of course I wouldn't do that,\nbut it just happens that we don't really know any of them very well. And\ndown here, there simply aren't any to know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI could not but admire the convincing manner in which she spoke. It\nwould not have surprised me to be told that she really believed every\nword she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You say that Ferdy might leave George his money. Well, I don't believe\nit's so very much anyway; it was quite a comfortable fortune before the\nwar, but that's nothing nowadays. Besides we're hoping that George will\ngo in for politics when he's a little older, and I don't think it would\ndo him any good in the constituency to inherit money from a Mr.\nRabenstein.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is George interested in politics?\" I asked, to change the conversation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I do hope so. After all, there's the family constituency waiting\nfor him. It's a safe Conservative seat and one can't expect Freddy to go\non with the grind of the House of Commons indefinitely.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMuriel was grand. She talked already of the constituency as though\ntwenty generations of Elands had sat for it. Her remark, however, was my\nfirst intimation that Freddy's ambition was not satisfied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose Freddy would go to the House of Lords when George was old\nenough to stand.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We've done a good deal for the party,\" said Muriel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMuriel was a Catholic and she often told you that she had been educated\nin a convent--\"Such sweet women, those nuns, I always said that if I had\na daughter I should have sent her to a convent too\"--but she liked her\nservants to be Church of England, and on Sunday evenings we had what was\ncalled supper because the fish was cold and there was ice-cream, so that\nthey could go to church, and we were waited on by two footmen instead of\nfour. It was still light when we finished and Freddy and I, smoking our\ncigars, walked up and down the terrace in the gloaming. I suppose Muriel\nhad told him of her conversation with me, and it may be that his refusal\nto let George see his great-uncle still troubled him, but being subtler\nthan she he attacked the question more indirectly. He told me that he\nhad been very much worried about George. It had been a great\ndisappointment that he had refused to go into the army.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have thought he'd have loved the life,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And he would certainly have looked marvellous in his Guards uniform.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He would, wouldn't he?\" returned Freddy, ingenuously. \"I wonder he\ncould resist that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had been completely idle at Oxford; although his father had given him\na very large allowance, he had got monstrously into debt; and now he had\nbeen sent down. But though he spoke so tartly I could see that he was\nnot a little proud of his scapegrace son, he loved him with oh, such an\nun-English love, and in his heart it flattered him that George had cut\nsuch a dash.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why should you worry?\" I said. \"You don't really care if George has a\ndegree or not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFreddy chuckled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I don't suppose I do really. I always think the only important\nthing about Oxford is that people know you were there, and I dare say\nthat George isn't any wilder than the other young men in his set. It's\nthe future I'm thinking of. He's so damned idle. He doesn't seem to want\nto do anything but have a good time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's young, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's net interested in politics, and though he's so good at games he's\nnot even very keen on sport. He seems to spend most of his time\nstrumming the piano.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's a harmless amusement.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, yes, I don't mind that, but he can't go on loafing indefinitely.\nYou see, all this will be his one day.\" Freddy gave a sweeping gesture\nthat seemed to embrace the whole county, but I knew that he did not own\nit all yet. \"I'm very anxious that he should be fit to assume his\nresponsibilities. His mother is very ambitious for him, but I only want\nhim to be an English gentleman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFreddy gave me a sidelong glance as though he wanted to say something\nbut hesitated in case I thought it ridiculous; but there is one\nadvantage in being a writer that, since people look upon you as of no\naccount, they will often say things to you that they would not to their\nequals. He thought he would risk it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, I've got an idea that nowhere in the world now is the Greek\nideal of life so perfectly cultivated as by the English country\ngentleman living on his estates. I think his life has the beauty of a\nwork of art.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI could not but smile when I reflected that it was impossible for the\nEnglish country gentleman in these days to do anything of the sort\nwithout a packet of money safely invested in American Bonds, but I\nsmiled with sympathy. I thought it rather touching that this Jewish\nfinancier should cherish so romantic a dream.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want him to be a good landlord. I want him to take his part in the\naffairs of the country. I want him to be a thorough sportsman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor mutt,\" I thought, but said: \"Well, what are your plans for George\nnow?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think he has a fancy for the diplomatic service. He's suggested going\nto Germany to learn the language.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A very good idea, I should have thought.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For some reason he's got it into his head that he wants to go to\nMunich.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A nice place.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext day I went back to London and shortly after my arrival rang up\nFerdy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry, but George isn't able to come to lunch on Wednesday.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What about Friday?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Friday's no good either.\" I thought it useless to beat about the bush.\n\"The fact is, his people aren't keen on his lunching with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a moment's silence. Then:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see. Well, will you come on Wednesday anyway?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I'd like to,\" I answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo on Wednesday at half-past one I strolled round to Curzon Street.\nFerdy received me with the somewhat elaborate graciousness that he\ncultivated. He made no reference to the Blands. We sat in the\ndrawing-room and I could not help reflecting what an eye for beautiful\nobjects that family had. The room was more crowded than the fashion of\nto-day approves and the gold snuffboxes in vitrines, the French china,\nappealed to a taste that was not mine; but they were no doubt choice\npieces; and the Louis XV suite, with its beautiful <i>petit point</i>, must\nhave been worth an enormous lot of money. The pictures on the walls by\nLancret, Pater and Watteau did not greatly interest me, but I recognised\ntheir intrinsic excellence. It was a proper setting for this aged man of\nthe world. It fitted his period. Suddenly the door opened and George was\nannounced. Ferdy saw my surprise and gave me a little smile of triumph.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm very glad you were able to come after all,\" he said as he shook\nGeorge's hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI saw him in a glance take in his great-nephew whom he saw to-day for\nthe first time. George was very well dressed. He wore a short black\ncoat, striped trousers and the grey double-breasted waistcoat which at\nthat time was the mode. You could only wear it with elegance if you were\ntall and thin and your belly was slightly concave. I felt sure that\nFerdy knew exactly who George's tailor was and what haberdasher he went\nto and approved of them. George, so smart and trim, wearing his clothes\nso beautifully, certainly looked very handsome. We went down to\nluncheon. Ferdy had the social graces at his fingers' ends and he put\nthe boy at his ease, but I saw that he was carefully appraising him;\nthen, I do not know why, he began to tell some of his Jewish stories. He\ntold them with gusto and with his wonderful mimicry. I saw George flush,\nand though he laughed at them, I could see that it was with\nembarrassment. I wondered what on earth had induced Ferdy to be so\ntactless. But he was watching George and he told story after story. It\nlooked as though he would never stop. I wondered if for some reason I\ncould not grasp he was taking a malicious pleasure in the boy's obvious\ndiscomfiture. At last we went upstairs and to make things easier I asked\nFerdy to play the piano. He played us three or four little waltzes. He\nhad lost none of his exquisite lightness nor his sense of their lilting\nrhythm. Then he turned to George.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you play?\" he asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A little.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Won't you play something?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I only play classical music. I don't think it would interest\nyou.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFerdy smiled slightly, but did not insist. I said it was time for me to\ngo and George accompanied me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a filthy old Jew,\" he said as soon as we were in the street. \"I\nhated those stories of his.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're his great stunt. He always tells them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would you if you were a Jew?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI shrugged my shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How is it you came to lunch after all?\" I asked George.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe chuckled. He was a light-hearted creature, with a sense of humour,\nand he shook off the slight irritation his great-uncle had caused him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He went to see Granny. You don't know Granny, do you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She treats daddy like a kid in Etons. Granny said I was to go to lunch\nwith great-uncle Ferdy and what Granny says goes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA week or two later George went to Munich to learn German. I happened\nthen to go on a journey and it was not till the following spring that I\nwas again in London. Soon after my arrival I found myself sitting next\nto Muriel Bland at dinner. I asked after George.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's still in Germany,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see in the papers that you're going to have a great beano at Tilby\nfor his coming of age.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We're going to entertain the tenants and they're making George a\npresentation.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was less exuberant than usual, but I did not pay much attention to\nthe fact. She led a strenuous life and it might be that she was tired. I\nknew she liked to talk of her son, so I continued.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose George has been having a grand time in Germany,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe did not answer for a moment and I gave her a glance. I was surprised\nto see that her eyes were filled with tears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid George has gone mad,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What <i>do</i> you mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We've been so frightfully worried, Freddy's so angry, he won't even\ndiscuss it. I don't know what we're going to do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course it immediately occurred to me that George, who, I supposed,\nlike most young Englishmen sent to learn the language, had been put with\na German family, had fallen in love with the daughter of the house and\nwanted to marry her. I had a pretty strong suspicion that the Blands\nwere intent on his making a very grand marriage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, what's happened?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He wants to become a pianist.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A what?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A professional pianist.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What on earth put that idea in his head?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Heaven knows. We didn't know anything about it. We thought he was\nworking for his exam. I went out to see him. I thought I'd like to know\nthat he was getting on all right. Oh, my dear. He looks like nothing on\nearth. And he used to be so smart; I could have cried. He told me he\nwasn't going in for the exam, and had never had any intention of doing\nso; he'd only suggested the diplomatic service so that we'd let him go\nto Germany and he'd be able to study music.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But has he any talent?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, that's neither here nor there. Even if he had the genius of\nPaderewski we couldn't have George traipsing around the country playing\nat concerts. No one can deny that I'm very artistic, and so is Freddy,\nwe love music and we've always known a lot of artists, but George will\nhave a very great position, it's out of the question. We've set our\nhearts on his going into Parliament. He'll be very rich one day. There's\nnothing he can't aspire to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you point all that out to him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I did. He laughed at me. I told him he'd break his father's\nheart. He said his father could always fall back on Harry. Of course I'm\ndevoted to Harry, and he's as clever as a monkey, but it was always\nunderstood that he was to go into the business; even though I am his\nmother I can see that he hasn't got the advantages that George has. Do\nyou know what he said to me? He said that if his father would settle\nfive pounds a week on him he would resign everything in Harry's favour\nand Harry could be his father's heir and succeed to the baronetcy and\neverything. It's too ridiculous. He said that if the Crown Prince of\nRoumania could abdicate a throne he didn't see why he couldn't abdicate\na baronetcy. But you can't do that. Nothing can prevent him from being\nthird baronet and if Freddy should be granted a peerage from succeeding\nto it at Freddy's death. Do you know, he even wants to drop the name of\nBland and take some horrible German name.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI could not help asking what.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bleikogel or something like that,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat was a name I recognised. I remembered Ferdy telling me that Hannah\nRabenstein had married Alfons Bleikogel who became eventually Sir Alfred\nBland, first Baronet. It was all very strange. I wondered what had\nhappened to the charming and so typically English boy whom I had seen\nonly a few months before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course when I came home and told Freddy he was furious. I've never\nseen him so angry. He foamed at the mouth. He wired to George to come\nback immediately and George wired back to say he couldn't on account of\nhis work.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is he working?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"From morning till night. That's the maddening part of it. He never did\na stroke of work in his life. Freddy used to say he was born idle.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"H'm.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then Freddy wired to say that if he didn't come he'd stop his allowance\nand George wired back: 'Stop it.' That put the lid on. You don't know\nwhat Freddy can be when his back is up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI knew that Freddy had inherited a large fortune, but I knew also that\nhe had immensely increased it, and I could well imagine that behind the\ncourteous and amiable Squire of Tilby there was a ruthless man of\naffairs. He had been used to having his own way and I could believe that\nwhen crossed he would be hard and cruel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'd been making George a very handsome allowance, but you know how\nfrightfully extravagant he was. We didn't think he'd be able to hold out\nlong and in point of fact within a month he wrote to Ferdy and asked him\nto lend him a hundred pounds. Ferdy went to my mother-in-law, she's his\nsister, you know, and asked her what it meant. Though they hadn't spoken\nfor twenty years Freddy went to see him and begged him not to send\nGeorge a penny, and he promised he wouldn't. I don't know how George has\nbeen making both ends meet. I'm sure Freddy's right, but I can't help\nbeing rather worried. If I hadn't given Freddy my word of honour that I\nwouldn't send him anything I think I'd have slipped a few notes in a\nletter in case of accident. I mean, it's awful to think that perhaps he\nhasn't got enough to eat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It'll do him no harm to go short for a bit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We were in an awful hole, you know. We'd made all sorts of preparations\nfor his coming of age, and I'd issued hundreds of invitations. Suddenly\nGeorge said he wouldn't come. I was simply frantic. I wrote and wired. I\nwould have gone over to Germany only Freddy wouldn't let me. I\npractically went down on my bended knees to George. I begged him not to\nput us in such a humiliating position. I mean, it's the sort of thing\nit's so difficult to explain. Then my mother-in-law stepped in. You\ndon't know her, do you? She's an extraordinary old woman. You'd never\nthink she was Freddy's mother. She was German originally, but of very\ngood family.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To tell you the truth I'm rather frightened of her. She tackled Freddy\nand then she wrote to George herself. She said that if he'd come home\nfor his twenty-first birthday she'd pay any debts he had in Munich and\nwe'd all give a patient hearing to anything he had to say. He agreed to\nthat and we're expecting him one day next week. But I'm not looking\nforward to it, I can tell you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave a deep sigh. When we were walking upstairs after dinner Freddy\naddressed me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see Muriel has been telling you about George. The damned fool! I have\nno patience with him. Fancy wanting to be a pianist. It's so\nungentlemanly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's very young, you know,\" I said soothingly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's had things too easy for him. I've been much too indulgent. There's\nnever been a thing he wanted that I haven't given him. I'll learn him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Blands had a discreet apprehension of the uses of advertisement and\nI gathered from the papers that the celebrations at Tilby of George's\ntwenty-first birthday were conducted in accordance with the usage of\nEnglish county families. There was a dinner-party and a ball for the\ngentry and a collation and a dance in marquees on the lawn for the\ntenants. Expensive bands were brought down from London. In the\nillustrated papers were pictures of George surrounded by his family\nbeing presented with a solid silver tea-set by the tenantry. They had\nsubscribed to have his portrait painted, but since his absence from the\ncountry had made it impossible for him to sit, the tea-service had been\nsubstituted. I read in the columns of the gossip writers that his father\nhad given him a hunter, his mother a gramophone that changed its own\nrecords, his grandmother the dowager Lady Bland an <i>Encyclopædia\nBritannica</i> and his great-uncle Ferdinand Rabenstein a <i>Virgin and\nChild</i> by Pellegrino da Modena. I could not help observing that these\ngifts were bulky and not readily convertible into cash. From Ferdy's\npresence at the festivities I concluded that George's unaccountable\nvagary had effected a reconciliation between uncle and nephew. I was\nright. Ferdy did not at all like the notion of his great-nephew becoming\na professional pianist. At the first hint of danger to its prestige the\nfamily drew together and a united front was presented to oppose George's\ndesigns. Since I was not there I only know from hearsay what happened\nwhen the birthday celebrations were over. Ferdy told me something and so\ndid Muriel, and later George gave me his version. The Blands had very\nmuch the impression that when George came home and found himself\noccupying the centre of the stage, when, surrounded by splendour, he saw\nfor himself once more how much it meant to be the heir of a great\nestate, he would weaken. They surrounded him with love. They flattered\nhim. They hung on his words. They counted on the goodness of his heart\nand thought that if they were very kind to him he would not have the\ncourage to cause them pain. They seemed to take it for granted that he\nhad no intention of going back to Germany and in conversation included\nhim in all their plans. George did not say very much. He seemed to be\nenjoying himself. He did not open a piano. Things looked as though they\nwere going very well. Peace descended on the troubled house. Then one\nday at luncheon when they were discussing a garden-party to which they\nhad all been asked for one day of the following week, George said\npleasantly:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't count on me. I shan't be here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, George, why not?\" asked his mother.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must get back to my work. I'm leaving for Munich on Monday.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was an awful pause. Everyone looked for something to say, but was\nafraid of saying the wrong thing, and at last it seemed impossible to\nbreak it. Luncheon was finished in silence. Then George went into the\ngarden and the others, old Lady Bland and Ferdy, Muriel and Sir\nAdolphus, into the morning-room. There was a family council. Muriel\nwept. Freddy flew into a temper. Presently from the drawing-room they\nheard the sound of someone playing a nocturne of Chopin. It was George.\nIt was as though now he had announced his decision he had gone for\ncomfort, rest and strength to the instrument he loved. Freddy sprang to\nhis feet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Stop that noise,\" he cried. \"I won't have him play the piano in my\nhouse.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMuriel rang for a servant and gave him a message.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you tell Mr. Bland that her ladyship has a bad headache and would\nhe mind not playing the piano.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFerdy, the man of the world, was deputed to have a talk with George. He\nwas authorised to make him certain promises if he would give up the idea\nof becoming a pianist. If he did not wish to go into the diplomatic\nservice his father would not insist, but if he would stand for\nParliament he was prepared to pay his election expenses, give him a flat\nin London and make him an allowance of five thousand a year. I must say\nit was a handsome offer. I do not know what Ferdy said to the boy. I\nsuppose he painted to him the life that a young man could lead in London\non such an income. I am sure he made it very alluring. It availed\nnothing. All George asked was five pounds a week to be able to continue\nhis studies and to be left alone. He was indifferent to the position\nthat he might some day enjoy. He didn't want to hunt. He didn't want to\nshoot. He didn't want to be a Member of Parliament. He didn't want to be\na millionaire. He didn't want to be a baronet. He didn't want to be a\npeer. Ferdy left him defeated and in a state of considerable\nexasperation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter dinner that evening there was a battle royal. Freddy was a\nquick-tempered man, unused to opposition, and he gave George the rough\nside of his tongue. I gather that it was very rough indeed. The women\nwho sought to restrain his violence were sternly silenced. Perhaps for\nthe first time in his life Freddy would not listen to his mother. George\nwas obstinate and sullen. He had made up his mind and if his father\ndidn't like it he could lump it. Freddy was peremptory. He forbade\nGeorge to go back to Germany. George answered that he was twenty-one and\nhis own master. He would go where he chose. Freddy swore he would not\ngive him a penny.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right, I'll earn money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You! You've never done a stroke of work in your life. What do you\nexpect to do to earn money?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sell old clothes,\" grinned George.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a gasp from all of them. Muriel was so taken aback that she\nsaid a stupid thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Like a Jew?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, aren't I a Jew? And aren't you a Jewess and isn't daddy a Jew?\nWe're all Jews, the whole gang of us, and everyone knows it and what the\nhell's the good of pretending we're not?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen a very dreadful thing happened. Freddy burst suddenly into tears.\nI'm afraid he didn't behave very much like Sir Adolphus Bland, Bart.,\nM.P., and the good old English gentleman he so much wanted to be, but\nlike an emotional Adolf Bleikogel who loved his son and wept with\nmortification because the great hopes he had set on him were brought to\nnothing and the ambition of his life was frustrated. He cried noisily\nwith great loud sobs and pulled his beard and beat his breast and rocked\nto and fro. Then they all began to cry, old Lady Bland and Muriel, and\nFerdy, who sniffed and blew his nose and wiped the tears streaming down\nhis face, and even George cried. Of course it was very painful, but to\nour rough Anglo-Saxon temperament I am afraid it must seem also a trifle\nridiculous. No one tried to console anybody else. They just sobbed and\nsobbed. It broke up the party.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut it had no result on the situation. George remained obdurate. His\nfather would not speak to him. There were more scenes. Muriel sought to\nexcite his pity; he was deaf to her piteous entreaties, he did not seem\nto mind if he broke her heart, he did not care two hoots if he killed\nhis father. Ferdy appealed to him as a sportsman and a man of the world.\nGeorge was flippant and indeed personally offensive. Old Lady Bland with\nher guttural German accent and strong common-sense argued with him, but\nhe would not listen to reason. It was she, however, who at last found a\nway out. She made George acknowledge that it was no use to throw away\nall the beautiful things the world laid at his feet unless he had\ntalent. Of course he thought he had, but he might be mistaken. It was\nnot worth while to be a second-rate pianist. His only excuse, his only\njustification, was genius. If he had genius his family had no right to\nstand in his way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't expect me to show genius already,\" said George. \"I shall have\nto work for years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you sure you are prepared for that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's my only wish in the world. I'll work like a dog. I only want to be\ngiven my chance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis was the proposition she made. His father was determined to give him\nnothing and obviously they could not let the boy starve. He had\nmentioned five pounds a week. Well, she was willing to give him that\nherself. He could go back to Germany and study for two years. At the end\nof that time he must come back and they would get some competent and\ndisinterested person to hear him play, and if then that person said he\nshowed promise of becoming a first-rate pianist no further obstacles\nwould be placed in his way. He would be given every advantage, help and\nencouragement. If on the other hand that person decided that his natural\ngifts were not such as to ensure ultimate success he must promise\nfaithfully to give up all thoughts of making music his profession and in\nevery way accede to his father's wishes. George could hardly believe his\nears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean that, Granny?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But will daddy agree?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I vill see dat he does,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge seized her in his arms and impetuously kissed her on both cheeks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Darling,\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, but de promise?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave her his solemn word of honour that he would faithfully abide-by\nthe terms of the arrangement. Two days later he went back to Germany.\nThough his father consented unwillingly to his going, and indeed could\nnot help doing so, he would not be reconciled to him and when he left\nrefused to say good-bye to him. I imagine that in no manner could he\nhave caused himself such pain. I permit myself a trite remark. It is\nstrange that men, inhabitants for so short a while of an alien and\ninhuman world should go out of their way to cause themselves so much\nunhappiness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge had stipulated that during his two years of study his family\nshould not visit him, so that when Muriel heard some months before he\nwas due to come home that I was passing through Munich on my way to\nVienna, whither business called me, it was not unnatural that she should\nask me to look him up. She was anxious to have first-hand information\nabout him. She gave me George's address and I wrote ahead, telling him I\nwas spending a day in Munich, and asked him to lunch with me. His answer\nawaited me at the hotel. He said he worked all day and could not spare\nthe time to lunch with me, but if I would come to his studio about six\nhe would like so show me that and if I had nothing better to do would\nlove to spend the evening with me. So soon after six I went to the\naddress he gave me. He lived on the second floor of a large block of\nflats and when I came to his door I heard the sound of piano-playing. It\nstopped when I rang and George opened the door for me. I hardly\nrecognised him. He had grown very fat. His hair was extremely long, it\ncurled all over his head in picturesque confusion; and he had certainly\nnot shaved for three days. He wore a grimy pair of Oxford bags, a tennis\nshirt and slippers. He was not very clean and his finger-nails were\nrimmed with black. It was a startling change from the spruce, slim youth\nso elegantly dressed in such beautiful clothes that I had last seen. I\ncould not but think it would be a shock to Ferdy to see him now. The\nstudio was large and bare; on the walls were three or four unframed\ncanvases of a highly cubist nature, there were several arm-chairs much\nthe worse for wear, and a grand piano. Books were littered about and old\nnewspapers and art magazines. It was dirty and untidy and there was a\nfrowzy smell of stale beer and stale smoke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you live here alone?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I have a woman who comes in twice a week and cleans up. But I make\nmy own breakfast and lunch.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can you cook?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I only have bread and cheese and a bottle of beer for lunch. I dine\nat a <i>Bierstube</i>.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was pleasant to discover that he was very glad to see me. He seemed\nin great spirits and extremely happy. He asked after his relations and\nwe talked of one thing and another. He had a lesson twice a week and for\nthe rest of the time practised. He told me that he worked ten hours a\nday.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's a change,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Daddy said I was born tired. I wasn't really lazy. I didn't see the use\nof working at things that bored me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI asked him how he was getting on with the piano. He seemed to be\nsatisfied with his progress and I begged him to play to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, not now, I'm all in, I've been at it all day. Let's go out and dine\nand come back here later and then I'll play. I generally go to the same\nplace, there are several students I know there, and it's rather fun.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPresently we set out. He put on socks and shoes and a very old golf\ncoat, and we walked together through the wide quiet streets. It was a\nbrisk cold day. His step was buoyant. He looked round him with a sigh of\ndelight.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I love Munich,\" he said. \"It's the only city in the world where there's\nart in the very air you breathe. After all, art is the only thing that\nmatters, isn't it? I loathe the idea of going home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All the same I'm afraid you'll have to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know. I'll go all right, but I'm not going to think about it till the\ntime comes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When you do, you might do worse than get a haircut. If you don't mind\nmy saying so you look almost too artistic to be convincing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You English, you're such Philistines,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took me to a rather large restaurant in a side street, crowded even\nat that early hour with people dining and furnished heavily in the\nGerman medieval style. A table covered with a red cloth, well away from\nthe air, was reserved for George and his friends and when we went to it\nfour or five youths were at it. There was a Pole studying Oriental\nlanguages, a student of philosophy, a painter (I suppose the author of\nGeorge's cubist pictures), a Swede, and a young man who introduced\nhimself to me, clicking his heels, as Hans Reiting, <i>Dichter</i>, namely\nHans Reiting, poet. Not one of them was more than twenty-two and I felt\na trifle out of it. They all addressed George as <i>du</i> and I noticed that\nhis German was extremely fluent. I had not spoken it for some time and\nmine was rusty, so that I could not take much part in the lively\nconversation. But nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed myself. They ate\nsparingly, but drank a good deal of beer. They talked of art and women.\nThey were very revolutionary and though gay very much in earnest. They\nwere contemptuous of everyone you had ever heard of, and the only point\non which they all agreed was that in this topsy-turvy world only the\nvulgar could hope for success. They argued points of technique with\nanimation, and contradicted one another, and shouted and were obscene.\nThey had a grand time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt about eleven George and I walked back to his studio. Munich is a city\nthat frolics demurely and except about the Marienplatz the streets were\nstill and empty. When we got in he took off his coat and said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now I'll play to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI sat in one of the dilapidated arm-chairs and a broken spring stuck\ninto my behind, but I made myself as comfortable as I could. George\nplayed Chopin. I know very little of music and that is one of the\nreasons for which I have found this story difficult to write. When I go\nto a concert at the Queen's Hall and in the intervals read the programme\nit is all Greek to me. I know nothing of harmony and counterpoint. I\nshall never forget how humiliated I felt once when, having come to\nMunich for a Wagner Festival, I went to a wonderful performance of\n<i>Tristan und Isolde</i> and never heard a note of it. The first few bars\nsent me off and I began to think of what I was writing, my characters\nleapt into life and I heard their long conversations, I suffered their\npains and was a party to their joy; the years swept by and all sorts of\nthings happened to me, the spring brought me its rapture and in the\nwinter I was cold and hungry; and I loved and I hated and I died. I\nsuppose there were intervals in which I walked round and round the\ngarden and probably ate <i>Schinken-Brödchen</i> and drank beer, but I have\nno recollection of them. The only thing I know is that when the curtain\nfor the last time fell I woke with a start. I had had a wonderful time,\nbut I could not help thinking it was very stupid of me to come such a\nlong way and spend so much money if I couldn't pay attention to what I\nheard and saw.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI knew most of the things George played. They were the familiar pieces\nof concert programmes. He played with a great deal of dash. Then he\nplayed Beethoven's <i>Appassionata</i>. I used to play it myself when I\nplayed the piano (very badly) in my far distant youth and I still knew\nevery note of it. Of course it is a classic and a great work, it would\nbe foolish to deny it, but I confess that at this time of day it leaves\nme cold. It is like <i>Paradise Lost</i>, splendid, but a trifle stolid. This\ntoo George played with vigour. He sweated profusely. At first I could\nnot make out what was the matter with his playing, something did not\nseem to me quite right, and then it struck me that the two hands did not\nexactly synchronise, so that there was ever so slight an interval\nbetween the bass and the treble; but I repeat, I am ignorant of these\nthings; what disconcerted me might have been merely the effect of his\nhaving drunk a good deal of beer that evening or indeed only my fancy. I\nsaid all I could think of to praise him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I know I need a lot more work. I'm only a beginner, but I\nknow I can do it. I feel it in my bones. It'll take me ten years, but\nthen I shall be a pianist.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was tired and came away from the piano. It was after midnight and I\nsuggested going, but he would not hear of it. He opened a couple of\nbottles of beer and lit his pipe. He wanted to talk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you happy here?\" I asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very,\" he answered gravely. \"I'd like to stay for ever. I've never had\nsuch fun in my life. This evening, for instance. Wasn't it grand?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was very jolly. But one can't go on leading the student's life. Your\nfriends here will grow older and go away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Others'll come. There are always students here and people like that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, but you'll grow older too. Is there anything more lamentable than\nthe middle-aged man who tries to go on living the undergraduate's life?\nThe old fellow who wants to be a boy among boys, and tries to persuade\nhimself that they'll accept him as one of themselves--how ridiculous he\nis. It can't be done.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I feel so at home here. My poor father wants me to be an English\ngentleman. It gives me gooseflesh. I'm not a sportsman. I don't care a\ndamn for hunting and shooting and playing cricket. I was only acting.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You gave a very natural performance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It wasn't till I came here that I knew it wasn't real. I loved Eton,\nand Oxford was a riot, but all the same I knew I didn't belong. I played\nthe part all right, because acting's in my blood, but there was always\nsomething in me that wasn't satisfied. The house in Grosvenor Square is\na freehold and daddy paid a hundred and eighty thousand pounds for\nTilby; I don't know if you understand what I mean, I felt they were just\nfurnished houses we'd taken for the season and one of these days we'd\npack up and the real owners would come back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI listened to him attentively, but I wondered how much he was describing\nwhat he had obscurely felt and how much he imagined now in his changed\ncircumstances that he had felt.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I used to hate hearing great-uncle Ferdy tell his Jewish stories. I\nthought it so damned mean. I understand now; it was a safety valve. My\nGod, the strain of being a man about town. It's easier for daddy, he can\nplay the old English squire at Tilby, but in the City he can be himself.\nHe's all right. I've taken the make-up off and my stage clothes and at\nlast I can be my real self too. What a relief! You know, I don't like\nEnglish people. I never really know where I am with you. You're so dull\nand conventional. You never let yourselves go. There's no freedom in\nyou, freedom of the soul, and you're such funks. There's nothing in the\nworld you're so frightened of as doing the wrong thing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't forget that you're English yourself, George,\" I murmured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I? I'm not English. I haven't got a drop of English blood in me. I'm a\nJew and you know it, and a German Jew into the bargain. I don't want to\nbe English. I want to be a Jew. My friends are Jews. You don't know how\nmuch more easy I feel with them. I can be myself. We did everything we\ncould to avoid Jews at home; Mummy, because she was blonde, thought she\ncould get away with it and pretended she was a Gentile. What rot! D'you\nknow, I have a lot of fun wandering about the Jewish parts of Munich and\nlooking at the people. I went to Frankfort once, there are a lot of them\nthere, and I walked about and looked at the frowzy old men with their\nhooked noses and the fat women with their false hair. I felt such a\nsympathy for them, I felt I belonged to them, I could have kissed them.\nWhen they looked at me I wondered if they knew that I was one of them. I\nwish to God I knew Yiddish. I'd like to become friends with them, and go\ninto their houses and eat Kosher food and all that sort of thing. I\nwanted to go to a synagogue, but I was afraid I'd do the wrong thing and\nbe kicked out. I like the smell of the Ghetto and the sense of life, and\nthe mystery and the dust and the squalor and the romance. I shall, never\nget the longing for it out of my head now. That's the real thing. All\nthe rest is only pretence.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll break your father's heart,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's his or mine. Why can't he let me go? There's Harry. Harry would\nlove to be squire of Tilby. He'd be an English gentleman all right. You\nknow, mummy's set her heart on my marrying a Christian. Harry would love\nto. He'll found the good old English family all right. After all, I ask\nso little. I only want five pounds a week, and they can keep the title\nand the park and the Gainsboroughs and the whole bag of tricks.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, the fact remains that you gave your solemn word of honour to go\nback after two years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll go back all right,\" he said sullenly. \"Lea Makart has promised to\ncome and hear me play.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What'll you do if she says you're no good?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shoot myself,\" he said gaily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What nonsense,\" I answered in the same tone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do <i>you</i> feel at home in England?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No,\" I said, \"but then I don't feel at home anywhere else.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he was quite naturally not interested in me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I loathe the idea of going back. Now that I know what life has to offer\nI wouldn't be an English country gentleman for anything in the world. My\nGod, the boredom of it!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Money's a very nice thing and I've always understood it's very pleasant\nto be an English peer.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Money means nothing to me. I want none of the things it can buy, and I\ndon't happen to be a snob.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was growing very late and I had to get up early next day. It seemed\nunnecessary for me to pay too much attention to what George said. It was\nthe sort of nonsense a young man might very well indulge in when thrown\nsuddenly among painters and poets. Art is strong wine and needs a strong\nhead to carry it. The divine fire burns most efficiently in those who\ntemper its fury with horse sense. After all, George was not twenty-three\nyet. Time teaches. And when all was said and done his future was no\nconcern of mine. I bade him good-night and walked back to my hotel. The\nstars were shining in the indifferent sky. I left Munich in the morning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not tell Muriel on my return to London what George had said to me,\nor what he looked like, but contented myself with assuring her that he\nwas well and happy, working very hard, and seemed to be leading a\nvirtuous and sober life. Six months later he came home. Muriel asked me\nto go down to Tilby for the week-end: Ferdy was bringing Lea Makart to\nhear George play and he particularly wished me to be there. I accepted.\nMuriel met me at the station.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did you find George?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's very fat, but he seems in great spirits. I think he's pleased to\nbe back again. He's been very sweet to his father.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm glad of that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my dear, I do hope Lea Makart will say he's no good. It'll be such\na relief to all of us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid it'll be a terrible disappointment to him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Life is full of disappointments,\" said Muriel crisply. \"But one learns\nto put up with them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI gave her a smile of amusement. We were sitting in a Rolls, and there\nwas a footman as well as a chauffeur on the box. She wore a string of\npearls that had probably cost forty thousand pounds. I recollected that\nin the birthday honours Sir Adolphus Bland had not been one of the three\ngentlemen on whom the King had been pleased to confer a peerage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLea Makart was able to make only a flying visit. She was playing that\nevening at Brighton and would motor over to Tilby on the Sunday morning\nfor luncheon. She was returning to London the same day because she had a\nconcert in Manchester on the Monday. George was to play in the course of\nthe afternoon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's practising very hard,\" his mother told me. \"That's why he didn't\ncome with me to meet you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe turned in at the park gates and drove up the imposing avenue of elms\nthat led to the house. I found that there was no party.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI met the dowager Lady Bland for the first time. I had always been\ncurious to see her. I had had in my mind's eye a somewhat sensational\npicture of an old, old Jewish woman who lived alone in her grand house\nin Portland Place and, with a finger in every pie, ruled her family with\na despotic hand. She did not disappoint me. She was of a commanding\npresence, rather tall, and stout without being corpulent. Her\ncountenance was markedly Hebraic. She wore a rather heavy moustache and\na wig of a peculiarly metallic brown. Her dress was very grand, of black\nbrocade, and she had a row of large diamond stars on her breast and\nround her neck a chain of diamonds. Diamond rings gleamed on her\nwrinkled hands. She spoke in a rather loud harsh voice and with a strong\nGerman accent. When I was introduced to her she fixed me with shining\neyes. She summed me up with despatch and to my fancy at all events made\nno attempt to conceal from me that the judgment she formed was\nunfavourable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You have known my brother Ferdinand for many years, is it not so?\" she\nsaid, rolling a guttural R. \"My brother Ferdinand has always moved in\nvery good society. Where is Sir Adolphus, Muriel? Does he know your\nguest is arrived? And will you not send for George? If he does not know\nhis pieces by now he will not know them by to-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMuriel explained that Freddy was finishing a round of golf with his\nsecretary and that she had had George told I was there. Lady Bland\nlooked as though she thought Muriel's replies highly unsatisfactory and\nturned again to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My daughter-in-law tells me you have been in Italy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I've only just come back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is a beautiful country. How is the King?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI said I did not know.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I used to know him when he was a little boy. He was not very strong\nthen. His mother, Queen Margherita, was a great friend of mine. They\nthought he would never marry. The Duchess of Aosta was very angry when\nhe fell in love with that Princess of Montenegro.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe seemed to belong to some long-past period of history, but she was\nvery alert and I imagine that little escaped her beady eyes. Freddy,\nvery spruce in plus-fours, presently came in. It was amusing and yet a\nlittle touching to see this grey-bearded man, as a rule somewhat\ndomineering, so obviously on his best behaviour with the old lady. He\ncalled her Mamma. Then George came in. He was as fat as ever, but he had\ntaken my advice and had his hair cut; he was losing his boyish looks,\nbut he was a powerful and well set-up young man. It was good to see the\npleasure he took in his tea. He ate quantities of sandwiches and great\nhunks of cake. He had still a boy's appetite. His father watched him\nwith a tender smile and as I looked at him I could not be surprised at\nthe attachment which they all so obviously felt for him. He had an\ningenuousness, a charm and an enthusiasm which were certainly very\npleasant. There was about him a generosity of demeanour, a frankness and\na natural cordiality which could not but make people take to him. I do\nnot know whether it was owing to a hint from his grandmother or merely\nof his own good nature, but it was plain that he was going out of his\nway to be nice to his father; and in his father's soft eyes, in the way\nhe hung upon the boy's words, in his pleased, proud and happy look, you\nfelt how bitterly the estrangement of the last two years had weighed on\nhim. He adored George.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe played golf in the morning, a three-ball match, since Muriel, having\nto go to Mass, could not join us, and at one Ferdy arrived in Lea\nMakart's car. We sat down to luncheon. Of course Lea Makart's reputation\nwas well known to me. She was acknowledged to be the greatest woman\npianist in Europe. She was a very old friend of Ferdy's, who with his\ninterest and patronage had greatly helped her at the beginning of her\ncareer, and it was he who had arranged for her to come and give her\nopinion of George's chances. At one time I went as often as I could to\nhear her play. She had no affectations; she played as a bird sings,\nwithout any appearance of effort, very naturally, and the silvery notes\ndripped from her light fingers in a curiously spontaneous manner, so\nthat it gave you the impression that she was improvising those\ncomplicated rhythms. They used to tell me that her technique was\nwonderful. I could never make up my mind how much the delight her\nplaying gave me was due to her person. In those days she was the most\nethereal thing you could imagine, and it was surprising that a creature\nso sylphlike should be capable of so much power. She was very slight,\npale, with enormous eyes and magnificent black hair, and at the piano\nshe had a childlike wistfulness that was most appealing. She was very\nbeautiful in a hardly human way and when she played, a little smile on\nher closed lips, she seemed to be remembering things she had heard in\nanother world. Now, however, a woman in the early forties, she was\nsylphlike no more; she was stout and her face had broadened; she had no\nlonger that lovely remoteness, but the authority of her long succession\nof triumphs. She was brisk, business-like and somewhat overwhelming. Her\nvitality lit her with a natural spotlight as his sanctity surrounds the\nsaint with a halo. She was not interested in anything very much but her\nown affairs, but since she had humour and knew the world she was able to\ninvest them with gaiety. She held the conversation, but did not absorb\nit. George talked little. Every now and then she gave him a glance, but\ndid not try to draw him in. I was the only Gentile at the table. All but\nold Lady Bland spoke perfect English, yet I could not help feeling that\nthey did not speak like English people; I think they rounded their\nvowels more than we do, they certainly spoke louder, and the words\nseemed not to fall, but to gush from their lips. I think if I had been\nin another room where I could hear the tone but not the words of their\nspeech I should have thought it was in a foreign language that they were\nconversing. The effect was slightly disconcerting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLea Makart wished to set out for London at about six, so it was arranged\nthat George should play at four. Whatever the result of the audition, I\nfelt that I, a stranger in the circle which her departure must render\nexclusively domestic, would be in the way and so, pretending an early\nengagement in town next morning, I asked her if she would take me with\nher in her car.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt a little before four we all wandered into the drawing-room. Old Lady\nBland sat on a sofa with Ferdy; Freddy, Muriel and I made ourselves\ncomfortable in arm-chairs; and Lea Makart sat by herself. She chose\ninstinctively a high-backed Jacobean chair that had somewhat the air of\na throne, and in a yellow dress, with her olive skin, she looked very\nhandsome. She had magnificent eyes. She was very much made up and her\nmouth was scarlet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge gave no sign of nervousness. He was already seated at the piano\nwhen I went in with his father and mother, and he watched us quietly\nsettling ourselves down. He gave me the shadow of a smile. When he saw\nthat we were all at our ease he began to play. He played Chopin. He\nplayed two waltzes that were familiar to me, a polonaise and an <i>étude</i>.\nHe played with a great deal of brio. I wish I knew music well enough to\ngive an exact description of his playing. It had strength, and a\nyouthful exuberance, but I felt that he missed what to me is the\npeculiar charm of Chopin, the tenderness, the nervous melancholy, the\nwistful gaiety and the slightly faded romance that reminds me always of\nan Early Victorian keepsake. And again I had the vague sensation, so\nslight that it almost escaped me, that the two hands did not quite\nsynchronise. I looked at Ferdy and saw him give his sister a look of\nfaint surprise, Muriel's eyes were fixed on the pianist, but presently\nshe dropped them and for the rest of the time stared at the floor. His\nfather looked at him too, and his eyes were steadfast, but unless I was\nmuch mistaken he went pale and his face betrayed something like dismay.\nMusic was in the blood of all of them, all their lives they had heard\nthe greatest pianists in the world, and they judged with instinctive\nprecision. The only person whose face betrayed no emotion was Lea\nMakart. She listened very attentively. She was as still as an image in a\nniche.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last he stopped and turning round on his seat faced her. He did not\nspeak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it you want me to tell you?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey looked into one another's eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want you to tell me whether I have any chance of becoming in time a\npianist in the first rank.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not in a thousand years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a moment there was dead silence. Freddy's head sank and he looked\ndown at the carpet at his feet. His wife put out her hand and took his.\nBut George continued to look steadily at Lea Makart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ferdy has told me the circumstances,\" she said at last. \"Don't think\nI'm influenced by them. Nothing of this is very important.\" She made a\ngreat sweeping gesture that took in the magnificent room with the\nbeautiful things it contained and all of us. \"If I thought you had in\nyou the makings of an artist I shouldn't hesitate to beseech you to give\nup everything for art's sake. Art is the only thing that matters. In\ncomparison with art, wealth and rank and power are not worth a straw.\"\nShe gave us a look so sincere that it was void of insolence. \"We are the\nonly people who count. We give the world significance. You are only our\nraw material.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was not too pleased to be included with the rest under that heading,\nbut that is neither here nor there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I can see that you've worked very hard. Don't think it's been\nwasted. It will always be a pleasure to you to be able to play the piano\nand it will enable you to appreciate great playing as no ordinary person\ncan hope to do. Look at your hands. They're not a pianist's hands.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nInvoluntarily I glanced at George's hands. I had never noticed them\nbefore. I was astounded to see how podgy they were and how short and\nstumpy the fingers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your ear is not quite perfect. I don't think you can ever hope to be\nmore than a very competent amateur. In art the difference between the\namateur and the professional is immeasurable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge did not reply. Except for his pallor no one would have known that\nhe was listening to the blasting of all his hopes. The silence that fell\nwas quite awful. Lea Makart's eyes suddenly filled with tears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But don't take my opinion alone,\" she said. \"After all, I'm not\ninfallible. Ask somebody else. You know how good and generous Paderewski\nis. I'll write to him about you and you can go down and play to him. I'm\nsure he'll hear you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge now gave a little smile. He had very good manners and whatever he\nwas feeling did not want to make the situation too difficult for others.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think that's necessary, I am content to accept your verdict. To\ntell you the truth it's not so very different from my master's in\nMunich.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got up from the piano and lit a cigarette. It eased the strain. The\nothers moved a little in their chairs. Lea Makart smiled at George.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shall I play to you?\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe got up and went to the piano. She took off the rings with which her\nfingers were laden. She played Bach. I do not know the names of the\npieces, but I recognised the stiff ceremonial of the frenchified little\nGerman courts and the sober, thrifty comfort of the burghers, and the\ndancing on the village green, the green trees that looked like Christmas\ntrees, and the sunlight on the wide German country, and a tender\ncosiness; and in my nostrils there was a warm scent of the soil and I\nwas conscious of a sturdy strength that seemed to have its roots deep in\nmother earth, and of an elemental power that was timeless and had no\nhome in space. She played beautifully, with a soft brilliance that made\nyou think of the full moon shining at dusk in the summer sky. With\nanother part of me I watched the others and I saw how intensely they\nwere conscious of the experience. They were rapt. I wished with all my\nheart that I could get from music the wonderful exaltation that\npossessed them. She stopped, a smile hovered on her lips, and she put on\nher rings. George gave a little chuckle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That clinches it, I fancy,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe servants brought in tea and after tea Lea Makart and I bade the\ncompany farewell and got into the car. We drove up to London. She talked\nall the way, if not brilliantly at all events with immense gusto; she\ntold me of her early years in Manchester and of the struggle of her\nbeginnings. She was very interesting. She never even mentioned George;\nthe episode was of no consequence, it was finished and she thought of it\nno more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe little knew what was happening at Tilby. When we left George went out\non the terrace and presently his father joined him. Freddy had won the\nday, but he was not happy. With his more than feminine sensitiveness he\nfelt all that George was feeling, and George's anguish simply broke his\nheart. He had never loved his son more than then. When he appeared\nGeorge greeted him with a little smile. Freddy's voice broke. In a\nsudden and overwhelming emotion he found it in him to surrender the\nfruits of his victory.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, old boy,\" he said, \"I can't bear to think that you've had\nsuch a disappointment. Would you like to go back to Munich for another\nyear and then see?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge shook his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, it wouldn't be any good. I've had my chance. Let's call it a day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Try not to take it too hard.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see, the only thing in the world I want is to be a pianist. And\nthere's nothing doing. It's a bit thick if you come to think of it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge, trying so hard to be brave, smiled wanly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would you like to go round the world? You can get one of your Oxford\npals to go with you and I'll pay all the expenses. You've been working\nvery hard for a long time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thanks awfully, daddy, we'll talk about it. I'm just going for a stroll\nnow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shall I come with you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd rather go alone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen George did a strange thing. He put his arm round his father's neck,\nand kissed him on the lips. He gave a funny little moved laugh and\nwalked away. Freddy went back to the drawing-room. His mother, Ferdy and\nMuriel were sitting there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Freddy, why don't you marry the boy?\" said the old lady. \"He is\ntwenty-three. It would take his mind off his troubles and when he is\nmarried and has a baby he will soon settle down like everybody else.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Whom is he to marry, mamma?\" asked Sir Adolphus, smiling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's not so difficult. Lady Frielinghausen came to see me the other\nday with her daughter Violet. She is a very nice maiden and she will\nhave money of her own. Lady Frielinghausen gave me to understand that\nher Sir Jacob would come down very handsome if Violet made a good\nmatch.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMuriel flushed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hate Lady Frielinghausen. George is much too young to marry. He can\nafford to marry anyone he likes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOld Lady Bland gave her daughter a strange look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are a very foolish girl, Miriam,\" she said, using the name Muriel\nhad long discarded. \"As long as I am here I shall not allow you to\ncommit a foolishness.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe knew as well as if Muriel had said it in so many words that she\nwanted George to marry a Gentile, but she knew also that so long as she\nwas alive neither Freddy nor his wife would dare to suggest it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut George did not go for a walk. Perhaps because the shooting season\nwas about to open he took it into his head to go into the gun-room. He\nbegan to clean the gun that his mother had given him on his twentieth\nbirthday. No one had used it since he went to Germany. Suddenly the\nservants were startled by a report. When they went into the gun-room\nthey found George lying on the floor shot through the heart. Apparently\nthe gun had been loaded and George while playing about with it had\naccidentally shot himself. One reads of such accidents in the paper\noften.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI suppose that very few people know how Mrs. Albert Forrester came to\nwrite <i>The Achilles Statue</i>; and since it has been acclaimed as one of\nthe great novels of our time I cannot but think that a brief account of\nthe circumstances that gave it birth must be of interest to all serious\nstudents of literature; and indeed, if, as the critics say, this is a\nbook that will live, the following narrative, serving a better purpose\nthan to divert an idle hour, may be regarded by the historian of the\nfuture as a curious footnote to the literary annals of our day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEveryone of course remembers the success that attended the publication\nof <i>The Achilles Statue</i>. Month after month printers were kept busy\nprinting, binders were kept busy binding, edition after edition; and the\npublishers, both in England and America, were hard put to it to fulfil\nthe pressing orders of the booksellers. It was promptly translated into\nevery European tongue and it has been recently announced that it will\nsoon be possible to read it in Japanese and in Urdu. But it had\npreviously appeared serially in magazines on both sides of the Atlantic\nand from the editors of these Mrs. Albert Forrester's agent had wrung a\nsum that can only be described as thumping. A dramatisation of the work\nwas made, which ran for a season in New York, and there is little doubt\nthat when the play is produced in London it will have an equal success.\nThe film rights have been sold at a great price. Though the amount that\nMrs. Albert Forrester is reputed (in literary circles) to have made is\nprobably exaggerated, there can be no doubt that she will have earned\nenough money from this one book to save her for the rest of her life\nfrom any financial anxiety.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt is not often that a book meets with equal favour from the public and\nthe critics, and that she, of all persons, had (if I may so put it)\nsquared the circle must have proved the more gratifying to Mrs. Albert\nForrester, since, though she had received the commendation of the\ncritics in no grudging terms (and indeed had come to look upon it as her\ndue) the public had always remained strangely insensible to her merit.\nEach work she published, a slender volume beautifully printed and bound\nin white buckram, was hailed as a masterpiece, always to the length of a\ncolumn, and in the weekly reviews which you see only in the dusty\nlibrary of a very long-established club even to the extent of a page;\nand all well-read persons read and praised it. But well-read persons\napparently do not buy books, and she did not sell. It was indeed a\nscandal that so distinguished an author, with an imagination so delicate\nand a style so exquisite, should remain neglected of the vulgar. In\nAmerica she was almost completely unknown; and though Mr. Carl van\nVechten had written an article berating the public for its obtuseness,\nthe public remained callous. Her agent, a warm admirer of her genius,\nhad blackmailed an American publisher into taking two of her books by\nrefusing, unless he did so, to let him have others (trashy novels\ndoubtless) that he badly wanted, and they had been duly published. The\nreception they received from the press was flattering and showed that in\nAmerica the best minds were sensitive to her talent; but when it came to\nthe third book the American publisher (in the coarse way publishers\nhave) told the agent that any money he had to spare he preferred to\nspend on synthetic gin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSince <i>The Achilles Statue</i> Mrs. Albert Forrester's previous books have\nbeen republished (and Mr. Carl van Vechten has written another article\npointing out sadly, but firmly, that he had drawn the attention of the\nreading world to the merits of this exceptional writer fully fifteen\nyears ago), and they have been so widely advertised that they can\nscarcely have escaped the cultured reader's attention. It is\nunnecessary, therefore, for me to give an account of them; and it would\ncertainly be no more than cold potatoes after those two subtle articles\nby Mr. Carl van Vechten. Mrs. Albert Forrester began to write early. Her\nfirst work (a volume of elegies) appeared when she was a maiden of\neighteen; and from then on she published, every two or three years, for\nshe had too exalted a conception of her art to hurry her production, a\nvolume either of verse or prose. When <i>The Achilles Statue</i> was written\nshe had reached the respectable age of fifty-seven, so that it will be\nreadily surmised that the number of her works was considerable. She had\ngiven the world half a dozen volumes of verse, published under Latin\ntitles, such as <i>Felicitas</i>, <i>Pax Maris</i> and <i>Aes Triplex</i>, all of the\ngraver kind, for her muse, disinclined to skip on a light, fantastic\ntoe, trod a somewhat solemn measure. She remained faithful to the Elegy,\nand the Sonnet claimed much of her attention; but her chief distinction\nwas to revive the Ode, a form of poetry that the poets of the present\nday somewhat neglect; and it may be asserted with confidence that her\n<i>Ode to President Fallières</i> will find a place in every anthology of\nEnglish verse. It is admirable not only for the noble sonority of its\nrhythms, but also for its felicitous description of the pleasant land of\nFrance. Mrs. Albert Forrester wrote of the valley of the Loire with its\nmemories of du Bellay, of Chartres and the jewelled windows of its\ncathedral, of the sun-swept cities of Provence, with a sympathy all the\nmore remarkable since she had never penetrated further into France than\nBoulogne, which she visited shortly after her marriage on an excursion\nsteamer from Margate. But the physical mortification of being extremely\nseasick and the intellectual humiliation of discovering that the\ninhabitants of that popular seaside resort could not understand her\nfluent and idiomatic French made her determine not to expose herself a\nsecond time to experiences that were at once undignified and unpleasant;\nand she never again embarked on the treacherous element which she,\nhowever, sang (<i>Pax Maris</i>) in numbers both grave and sweet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere are some fine passages too in the <i>Ode to Woodrow Wilson</i>, and I\nregret that, owing to a change in her sentiments towards that no doubt\nexcellent man, the author decided not to reprint it. But I think it must\nbe admitted that Mrs. Albert Forrester's most distinguished work was in\nprose. She wrote several volumes of brief, but perfectly constructed,\nessays on such subjects as Autumn in Sussex, Queen Victoria, Death,\nSpring in Norfolk, Georgian Architecture, Monsieur de Diaghileff and\nDante; she also wrote works, both erudite and whimsical, on the Jesuit\nArchitecture of the XVIIth Century and on the Literary Aspect of the\nHundred Years' War. It was her prose that gained her that body of\ndevoted admirers, fit though few, as with her rare gift of phrase she\nherself put it, that proclaimed her the greatest master of the English\nlanguage that this century has seen. She admitted herself that it was\nher style, sonorous yet racy, polished yet eloquent, that was her strong\npoint; and it was only in her prose that she had occasion to exhibit the\ndelicious, but restrained, humour that her readers found so\nirresistible. It was not a humour of ideas, nor even a humour of words;\nit was much more subtle than that, it was a humour of punctuation: in a\nflash of inspiration she had discovered the comic possibilities of the\nsemi-colon, and of this she had made abundant and exquisite use. She was\nable to place it in such a way that if you were a person of culture with\na keen sense of humour, you did not exactly laugh through a\nhorse-collar, but you giggled delightedly, and the greater your culture\nthe more delightedly you giggled. Her friends said that it made every\nother form of humour coarse and exaggerated. Several writers had tried\nto imitate her; but in vain: whatever else you might say about Mrs.\nAlbert Forrester you were bound to admit that she was able to get every\nounce of humour out of the semi-colon and no one else could get within a\nmile of her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester lived in a flat not far from the Marble Arch,\nwhich combined the advantage of a good address and a moderate rent. It\nhad a handsome drawing-room on the street and a large bedroom for Mrs.\nAlbert Forrester, a darkish dining-room at the back and a small poky\nbedroom, next door to the kitchen, for Mr. Albert Forrester, who paid\nthe rent. It was in the handsome drawing-room that Mrs. Albert Forrester\nevery Tuesday afternoon received her friends. It was a severe and chaste\napartment. On the walls was a paper designed by William Morris himself\nand on this, in plain black frames, mezzotints collected before\nmezzotints grew expensive; the furniture was of the Chippendale period,\nbut for the roll-top desk, vaguely Louis XVI in character, at which Mrs.\nAlbert Forrester wrote her works. This was pointed out to visitors the\nfirst time they came to see her, and there were few who looked at it\nwithout emotion. The carpet was thick and the lights discreet. Mrs.\nAlbert Forrester sat in a straight-backed grandfather's chair covered\nwith red damask. There was nothing ostentatious about it, but since it\nwas the only comfortable chair in the room it set her apart as it were\nand above her guests. Tea was dispensed by a female of uncertain age,\nsilent and colourless, who was never introduced to anyone but who was\nknown to look upon it as a privilege to be allowed to save Mrs. Albert\nForrester from the irksome duty of pouring out tea. She was thus able to\ndevote herself entirely to conversation, and it must be admitted that\nher conversation was excellent. It was not sprightly; and since it is\ndifficult to indicate punctuation in speech it may have seemed to some\nslightly lacking in humour, but it was of wide range, solid, instructive\nand interesting. Mrs. Albert Forrester was well acquainted with social\nscience, jurisprudence and theology. She had read much and her memory\nwas retentive. She had a pretty gift for quotation, which is a\nserviceable substitute for wit, and having for thirty years known more\nor less intimately a great many distinguished people, she had a great\nmany interesting anecdotes to tell, which she placed with tact and which\nshe did not repeat more than was pardonable. Mrs. Albert Forrester had\nthe gift of attracting the most varied persons and you were liable at\none and the same time to meet in her drawing-room an ex-Prime Minister,\na newspaper proprietor and the ambassador of a First Class Power. I\nalways imagined that these great people came because they thought that\nhere they rubbed shoulders with Bohemia, but with a Bohemia sufficiently\nneat and clean for them to be in no danger that the dirt would come off\non them. Mrs. Albert Forrester was deeply interested in politics and I\nmyself heard a Cabinet Minister tell her frankly that she had a\nmasculine intelligence. She had been opposed to Female Suffrage, but\nwhen it was at last granted to women she began to dally with the idea of\ngoing into Parliament. Her difficulty was that she did not know which\nparty to choose.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After all,\" she said, with a playful shrug of her somewhat massive\nshoulders, \"I cannot form a party of one.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLike many serious patriots, in her inability to know for certain which\nway the cat would jump she held her political opinions in suspense; but\nof late she had been definitely turning towards Labour as the best hope\nof the country, and if a safe seat were offered her it was felt fairly\ncertain that she would not hesitate to come out into the open as a\nchampion of the oppressed proletariat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer drawing-room was always open to foreigners, to Czecho-Slovaks,\nItalians and Frenchmen if they were distinguished and to Americans even\nif they were obscure. But she was not a snob and you seldom met there a\nduke unless he was of a peculiarly serious turn and a peeress only if in\naddition to her rank she had the passport of some small social solecism\nsuch as having been divorced, written a novel or forged a cheque, which\nmight give her claim on Mrs. Albert Forrester's catholic sympathies. She\ndid not much care for painters, who were shy and silent; and musicians\ndid not interest her: even if they consented to play, and if they were\ncelebrated they were too often reluctant, their music was a hindrance to\nconversation: if people wanted music they could go to a concert; for her\npart she preferred the more subtle music of the soul. But her\nhospitality to writers, especially if they were promising and little\nknown, was warm and constant. She had an eye for budding talent and\nthere were few of the famous writers who from time to time drank a dish\nof tea with her whose first efforts she had not encouraged and whose\nearly steps she had not guided. Her own position was too well assured\nfor her to be capable of envy, and she had heard the word genius\nattached to her name too often to feel a trace of jealousy because the\ntalents of others brought them a material success that was denied to\nher.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester, confident in the judgment of posterity, could\nafford to be disinterested. With these elements then it is no wonder\nthat she had succeeded in creating something as near the French Salon of\nthe Eighteenth Century as our barbarous nation has ever reached. To be\ninvited to \"eat a bun and drink a cup of tea on Tuesday\" was a privilege\nthat few failed to recognise; and when you sat on your Chippendale chair\nin the discreetly lit but austere room, you could not but feel that you\nwere living literary history. The American Ambassador once said to Mrs.\nAlbert Forrester:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A cup of tea with you, Mrs. Forrester, is one of the richest\nintellectual treats which it has ever been my lot to enjoy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was indeed on occasion a trifle overwhelming. Mrs. Albert Forrester's\ntaste was so perfect, she so inevitably admired the right thing and made\nthe just observation about it, that sometimes you almost gasped for air.\nFor my part I found it prudent to fortify myself with a cocktail or two\nbefore I exposed myself to the rarefied atmosphere of her society.\nIndeed, I very nearly found myself for ever excluded from it, for one\nafternoon, presenting myself at the door, instead of asking the maid who\nopened it: \"Is Mrs. Forrester at home?\" I asked: \"Is there Divine\nService to-day?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course it was said in pure inadvertence, but it was unfortunate that\nthe maid sniggered and one of Mrs. Albert Forrester's most devoted\nadmirers, Ellen Hannaway, happened to be at the moment in the hall\ntaking off her galoshes. She told my hostess what I had said before I\ngot into the drawing-room, and as I entered Mrs. Albert Forrester fixed\nme with an eagle eye.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why did you ask if there was Divine Service to-day?\" she inquired.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI explained that I was absent-minded, but Mrs. Albert Forrester held me\nwith a gaze that I can only describe as compelling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean to suggest that my parties are...\" she searched for a\nword. \"Sacramental?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not know what she meant, but did not like to show my ignorance\nbefore so many clever people, and I decided that the only thing was to\nseize my trowel and the butter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your parties are like you, dear lady, perfectly beautiful and perfectly\ndivine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA little tremor passed through Mrs. Albert Forrester's substantial\nframe. She was like a man who enters suddenly a room filled with\nhyacinths; the perfume is so intoxicating that he almost staggers. But\nshe relented.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you were trying to be facetious,\" she said, \"I should prefer you to\nexercise your facetiousness on my guests rather than on my maids....\nMiss Warren will give you some tea.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester dismissed me with a wave of the hand, but she did\nnot dismiss the subject, since for the next two or three years whenever\nshe introduced me to someone she never failed to add:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must make the most of him, he only comes here as a penance. When he\ncomes to the door he always asks: Is there Divine Service to-day? So\namusing, isn't he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Mrs. Albert Forrester did not confine herself to weekly tea-parties:\nevery Saturday she gave a luncheon of eight persons; this according to\nher opinion being the perfect number for general conversation and her\ndining-room conveniently holding no more. If Mrs. Albert Forrester\nflattered herself upon anything it was not that her knowledge of English\nprosody was unique, but that her luncheons were celebrated. She chose\nher guests with care and an invitation to one of them was more than a\ncompliment, it was a consecration. Over the luncheon-table it was\npossible to keep the conversation on a higher level than in the mixed\ncompany of a tea-party and few can have left her dining-room without\ntaking away with them an enhanced belief in Mrs. Albert Forrester's\nability and a brighter faith in human nature. She only asked men, since,\nstout enthusiast for her sex as she was and glad to see women on other\noccasions, she could not but realise that they were inclined at table to\ntalk exclusively to their next-door neighbours and thus hinder the\ngeneral exchange of ideas that made her own parties an entertainment not\nonly of the body but of the soul. For it must be said that Mrs. Albert\nForrester gave you uncommonly good food, excellent wine and a first-rate\ncigar. Now to anyone who has partaken of literary hospitality this must\nappear very remarkable, since literary persons for the most part think\nhighly and live plainly; their minds are occupied with the things of the\nspirit and they do not notice that the roast mutton is underdone and the\npotatoes cold: the beer is all right, but the wine has a sobering\neffect, and it is unwise to touch the coffee. Mrs. Albert Forrester was\npleased enough to receive compliments on the fare she provided.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If people do me the honour to break bread with me,\" she said, \"it is\nonly fair that I should give them as good food as they can get at home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut if the flattery was excessive she deprecated it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You really embarrass me when you give me a meed of praise which is not\nmy due. You must praise Mrs. Bulfinch.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is Mrs. Bulfinch?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My cook.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's a treasure then, but you're not going to ask me to believe that\nshe's responsible for the wine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it good? I'm terribly ignorant of such things; I put myself entirely\nin the hands of my wine merchant.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut if mention was made of the cigars Mrs. Albert Forrester beamed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, for them you must compliment Albert. It is Albert who chooses the\ncigars and I am given to understand that no one knows more about a cigar\nthan Albert.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at her husband, who sat at the end of the table, with the\nproud bright eyes of a pedigree hen (a Buff Orpington for choice)\nlooking at her only chick. Then there was a quick flutter of\nconversation as the guests, anxious to be civil to their host and\nrelieved at length to find an occasion, expressed their appreciation of\nhis peculiar merit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're very kind,\" he said. \"I'm glad you like them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he would give a little discourse on cigars, explaining the\nexcellencies he sought and regretting the deterioration in quality which\nhad followed on the commercialisation of the industry. Mrs. Albert\nForrester listened to him with a complacent smile, and it was plain that\nshe enjoyed this little triumph of his. Of course you cannot go on\ntalking of cigars indefinitely and as soon as she perceived that her\nguests were growing restive she broached a topic of more general, and it\nmay be of more significant, interest. Albert subsided into silence. But\nhe had had his moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was Albert who made Mrs. Forrester's luncheons to some less\nattractive than her tea-parties, for Albert was a bore; but though\nwithout doubt perfectly conscious of the fact, she made a point that he\nshould come to them and in fact had fixed upon Saturdays (for the rest\nof the week he was busy) in order that he should be able to. Mrs. Albert\nForrester felt that her husband's presence on these festive occasions\nwas an unavoidable debt that she paid to her own self-respect. She would\nnever by a negligence admit to the world that she had married a man who\nwas not spiritually her equal, and it may be that in the silent watches\nof the nights she asked herself where indeed such could have been found.\nMrs. Albert Forrester's friends were troubled by no such reticence and\nthey said it was dreadful that such a woman should be burdened with such\na man. They asked each other how she had ever come to marry him and\n(being mostly celibate) answered despairingly that no one ever knew why\nanybody married anybody else.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was not that Albert was a verbose and aggressive bore; he did not\nbuttonhole you with interminable stories or pester you with pointless\njokes; he did not crucify you on a platitude or hamstring you with a\ncommonplace; he was just dull. A cipher. Clifford Boyleston, for whom\nthe French Romantics had no secrets and who was himself a writer of\nmerit, had said that when you looked into a room into which Albert had\njust gone there was nobody there. This was thought very clever by Mrs.\nAlbert Forrester's friends and Rose Waterford, the well-known novelist\nand the most fearless of women, had ventured to repeat it to Mrs. Albert\nForrester. Though she pretended to be annoyed, she had not been able to\nprevent the smile that rose to her lips. Her behaviour towards Albert\ncould not but increase the respect in which her friends held her. She\ninsisted that whatever in their secret hearts they thought of him, they\nshould treat him with the decorum that was due to her husband. Her own\ndemeanour was admirable. If he chanced to make an observation she\nlistened to him with a pleasant expression and when he fetched her a\nbook that she wanted or gave her his pencil to make a note of an idea\nthat had occurred to her, she always thanked him. Nor would she allow\nher friends pointedly to neglect him, and though, being a woman of tact,\nshe saw that it would be asking too much of the world if she took him\nabout with her always, and she went out much alone, yet her friends knew\nthat she expected them to ask him to dinner at least once a year. He\nalways accompanied her to public banquets when she was going to make a\nspeech, and if she delivered a lecture she took care that he should have\na seat on the platform.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlbert was, I believe, of average height, but perhaps because you never\nthought of him except in connection with his wife (of imposing\ndimensions) you only thought of him as a little man. He was spare and\nfrail and looked older than his age. This was the same as his wife's.\nHis hair, which he kept very short, was white and meagre, and he wore a\nstubby white moustache; his was a face, thin and lined, without a\nnoticeable feature; and his blue eyes, which once might have been\nattractive, were now pale and tired. He was always very neatly dressed\nin pepper-and-salt trousers, which he chose always of the same pattern,\na black coat and a grey tie with a small pearl pin in it. He was\nperfectly unobtrusive, and when he stood in Mrs. Albert Forrester's\ndrawing-room to receive the guests whom she had asked to luncheon you\nnoticed him as little as you noticed the quiet and gentlemanly\nfurniture. He was well-mannered and it was with a pleasant, courteous\nsmile that he shook hands with them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How do you do? I'm very glad to see you,\" he said if they were friends\nof some standing. \"Keeping well, I hope?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut if they were strangers of distinction coming for the first time to\nthe house, he went to the door as they entered the drawing-room, and\nsaid:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am Mrs. Albert Forrester's husband. I will introduce you to my wife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he led the visitor to where Mrs. Albert Forrester stood, with her\nback to the light, and she with a glad and eager gesture advanced to\nmake the stranger welcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was agreeable to see the demure pride he took in his wife's literary\nreputation and the self-effacement with which he furthered her\ninterests. He was always there when he was wanted and never when he\nwasn't. His tact, if not deliberate, was instinctive. Mrs. Albert\nForrester was the first to acknowledge his merits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I really don't know what I should do without him,\" she said. \"He's\ninvaluable to me. I read him everything I write and his criticisms are\noften very useful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Molière and his cook,\" said Miss Waterford.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is that funny, dear Rose?\" asked Mrs. Forrester, somewhat acidly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Mrs. Albert Forrester did not approve of a remark, she had a way\nthat put many persons to confusion of asking you whether it was a joke\nwhich she was too dense to see. But it was impossible to embarrass Miss\nWaterford. She was a lady who in the course of a long life had had many\naffairs, but only one passion, and this was for printer's ink. Mrs.\nAlbert Forrester tolerated rather than approved her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come, come, my dear,\" she replied, \"you know very well that he wouldn't\nexist without you. He wouldn't know us. It must be wonderful to him to\ncome in contact with all the best brains and the most distinguished\npeople of our day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It may be that the bee would perish without the hive which shelters it,\nbut the bee nevertheless has a significance of its own.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd since Mrs. Albert Forrester's friends, though they knew all about\nart and literature, knew little about natural history, they had no reply\nto this observation. She went on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He doesn't interfere with me. He knows subconsciously when I don't want\nto be disturbed and, indeed, when I am following out a train of thought\nI find his presence in the room a comfort rather than a hindrance to\nme.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Like a Persian cat,\" said Miss Waterford.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But like a very well-trained, well-bred, and well-mannered Persian\ncat,\" answered Mrs. Forrester severely, thus putting Miss Waterford in\nher place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Mrs. Albert Forrester had not finished with her husband.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We who belong to the intelligentsia,\" she said, \"are apt to live in a\nworld too exclusively our own. We are interested in the abstract rather\nthan in the concrete, and sometimes I think that we survey the bustling\nworld of human affairs in too detached a manner and from too serene a\nheight. Do you not think that we stand in danger of becoming a little\ninhuman? I shall always be grateful to Albert because he keeps me in\ncontact with the man in the street.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was on account of this remark, to which none of her friends could\ndeny the rare insight and subtlety that characterised so many of her\nutterances, that for some time Albert was known in her immediate circle\nas The Man in the Street. But this was only for a while, and it was\nforgotten. He then became known as The Philatelist. It was Clifford\nBoyleston, with his wicked wit, who invented the name. One day, his poor\nbrain exhausted by the effort to sustain a conversation with Albert, he\nhad asked in desperation:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you collect stamps?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No,\" answered Albert mildly. \"I'm afraid I don't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Clifford Boyleston had no sooner asked the question than he saw its\npossibilities. He had written a book on Baudelaire's aunt by marriage,\nwhich had attracted the attention of all who were interested in French\nliterature, and was well known in his exhaustive studies of the French\nspirit to have absorbed a goodly share of the Gallic quickness and the\nGallic brilliancy. He paid no attention to Albert's disclaimer, but at\nthe first opportunity informed Mrs. Albert Forrester's friends that he\nhad at last discovered Albert's secret. He collected stamps. He never\nmet him afterwards without asking him:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Mr. Forrester, how is the stamp collection?\" Or: \"Have you been\nbuying any stamps since I saw you last?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt mattered little that Albert continued to deny that he collected\nstamps, the invention was too apt not to be made the most of; Mrs.\nAlbert Forrester's friends insisted that he did, and they seldom spoke\nto him without asking him how he was getting on. Even Mrs. Albert\nForrester, when she was in a specially gay humour, would sometimes speak\nof her husband as The Philatelist. The name really did seem to fit\nAlbert like a glove. Sometimes they spoke of him thus to his face and\nthey could not but appreciate the good nature with which he took it; he\nsmiled unresentfully and presently did not even protest that they were\nmistaken.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course Mrs. Albert Forrester had too keen a social sense to\njeopardise the success of her luncheons by allowing her more\ndistinguished guests to sit on either side of Albert. She took care that\nonly her older and more intimate friends should do this, and when the\nappointed victims came in she would say to them:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know you won't mind sitting by Albert, will you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey could only say that they would be delighted, but if their faces too\nplainly expressed their dismay she would pat their hands playfully and\nadd:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Next time you shall sit by me. Albert is so shy with strangers and you\nknow so well how to deal with him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey did: they simply ignored him. So far as they were concerned the\nchair in which he sat might as well have been empty. There was so sign\nthat it annoyed him to be taken no notice of by persons who after all\nwere eating food he paid for, since the earnings of Mrs. Forrester could\ncertainly not have provided her guests with spring salmon and forced\nasparagus. He sat quiet and silent, and if he opened his mouth it was\nonly to give a direction to one of the maids. If a guest were new to him\nhe would let his eyes rest on him in a stare that would have been\nembarrassing if it had not been so childlike. He seemed to be asking\nhimself what this strange creature was; but what answer his mild\nscrutiny gave him he never revealed. When the conversation grew animated\nhe would look from one speaker to the other, but again you could not\ntell from his thin, lined face what he thought of the fantastic notions\nthat were bandied across the table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nClifford Boyleston said that all the wit and wisdom he heard passed over\nhis head like water over a duck's back. He had given up trying to\nunderstand and now only made a semblance of listening. But Harry\nOakland, the versatile critic, said that Albert was taking it all in; he\nfound it all too, too marvellous, and with his poor, muddled brain he\nwas trying desperately to make head or tail of the wonderful things he\nheard. Of course in the City he must boast of the distinguished persons\nhe knew, perhaps there he was a light of learning and letters, an\nauthority on the ideal; it would be perfectly divine to hear what he\nmade of it all. Harry Oakland was one of Mrs. Albert Forrester's\nstaunchest admirers, and had written a brilliant and subtle essay on her\nstyle. With his refined and even beautiful features he looked like a San\nSebastian who had had an accident with a hair-restorer; for he was\nuncommonly hirsute. He was a very young man, not thirty, but he had been\nin turn a dramatic critic, and a critic of fiction, a musical critic and\na critic of painting. But he was getting a little tired of art and\nthreatened to devote his talents in future to the criticism of sport.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlbert, I should explain, was in the City and it was a misfortune that\nMrs. Forrester's friends thought she bore with meritorious fortitude\nthat he was not even rich. There would have been something romantic in\nit if he had been a merchant-prince who held the fate of nations in his\nhand or sent argosies, laden with rare spices, to those ports of the\nLevant the names of which have provided many a poet with so rich and\nrare a rhyme. But Albert was only a currant merchant and was supposed to\nmake no more than just enabled Mrs. Albert Forrester to conduct her life\nwith distinction and even with liberality. Since his occupation kept him\nin his office till six o'clock he never managed to get to Mrs. Albert\nForrester's Tuesdays till the most important visitors were gone. By the\ntime he arrived, there were seldom more than three or four of her more\nintimate friends in the drawing-room, discussing with freedom and humour\nthe guests who had departed, and when they heard Albert's key in the\nfront door they realised with one accord that it was late. In a moment\nhe opened the door in his hesitating way and looked mildly in. Mrs.\nAlbert Forrester greeted him with a bright smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come in, Albert, come in. I think you know everybody here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlbert entered and shook hands with his wife's friends.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you just come from the City?\" she asked eagerly, though she knew\nthere was nowhere else he could have come from. \"Would you like a cup of\ntea?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, thank you, my dear. I had tea in my office.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester smiled still more brightly and the rest of the\ncompany thought she was perfectly wonderful with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, but I know you like a second cup. I will pour it out for you\nmyself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe went to the tea-table and, forgetting that the tea had been stewing\nfor an hour and a half and was stone cold, poured him out a cup and\nadded milk and sugar. Albert took it with a word of thanks, and meekly\nstirred it, but when Mrs. Forrester resumed the conversation which his\nappearance had interrupted, without tasting it put it quietly down. His\narrival was the signal for the party finally to break up and one by one\nthe remaining guests took their departure. On one occasion, however, the\nconversation was so absorbing and the point at issue so important that\nMrs. Albert Forrester would not hear of their going.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must be settled once for all. And after all,\" she remarked in a\nmanner that for her was almost arch, \"this is a matter on which Albert\nmay have something to say. Let us have the benefit of his opinion.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was when women were beginning to cut their hair and the subject of\ndiscussion was whether Mrs. Albert Forrester should or should not\nshingle. Mrs. Albert Forrester was a woman of authoritative presence.\nShe was large-boned and her bones were well-covered; had she not been so\ntall and strong it might have suggested itself to you that she was\ncorpulent. But she carried her weight gallantly. Her features were a\nlittle larger than life-size and it was this that gave her face\ndoubtless the look of virile intellectuality that it certainly\npossessed. Her skin was dark and you might have thought that she had in\nher veins some trace of Levantine blood: she admitted that she could not\nbut think there was in her a gypsy strain and that would account, she\nfelt, for the wild and lawless passion that sometimes characterised her\npoetry. Her eyes were large and black and bright, her nose like the\ngreat Duke of Wellington's, but more fleshy, and her chin square and\ndetermined. She had a big mouth, with full red lips, which owed nothing\nto cosmetics, for of these Mrs. Albert Forrester had never deigned to\nmake use; and her hair, thick, solid and grey, was piled on the top of\nher head in such a manner as to increase her already commanding height.\nShe was in appearance an imposing, not to say an alarming, female.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was always very suitably dressed in rich materials of sombre hue and\nshe looked every inch a woman of letters; but in her discreet way (being\nafter all human and susceptible to vanity) she followed the fashions and\nthe cut of her gowns was modish. I think for some time she had hankered\nto shingle her hair, but she thought it more becoming to do it at the\nsolicitation of her friends than on her own initiative.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, you must, you must,\" said Harry Oakland, in his eager, boyish way.\n\"You'd look too, too wonderful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nClifford Boyleston, who was now writing a book on Madame de Maintenon,\nwas doubtful. He thought it a dangerous experiment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think,\" he said, wiping his eye-glasses with a cambric handkerchief,\n\"I think when one has made a type one should stick to it. What would\nLouis XIV have been without his wig?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm hesitating,\" said Mrs. Forrester. \"After all, we must move with the\ntimes. I am of my day and I do not wish to lag behind. America, as\nWilhelm Meister said, is here and now.\" She turned brightly to Albert.\n\"What does my lord and master say about it? What is your opinion,\nAlbert? To shingle or not to shingle, that is the question.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid my opinion is not of great importance, my dear,\" he answered\nmildly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To me it is of the greatest importance,\" answered Mrs. Albert\nForrester, flatteringly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe could not but see how beautifully her friends thought she treated\nThe Philatelist.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I insist,\" she proceeded, \"I insist. No one knows me as you do, Albert.\nWill it suit me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It might,\" he answered. \"My only fear is that with your--statuesque\nappearance short hair would perhaps suggest,--well, shall we say, the\nIsle of Greece where burning Sappho loved and sung.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a moment's embarrassed pause. Rose Waterford smothered a\ngiggle, but the others preserved a stony silence. Mrs. Forrester's smile\nfroze on her lips. Albert had dropped a brick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I always thought Byron a very mediocre poet,\" said Mrs. Albert\nForrester at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe company broke up. Mrs. Albert Forrester did not shingle, nor indeed\nwas the matter ever again referred to.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was towards the end of another of Mrs. Albert Forrester's Tuesdays\nthat the event occurred that had so great an influence on her literary\ncareer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt had been one of her most successful parties. The leader of the Labour\nParty had been there and Mrs. Albert Forrester had gone as far as she\ncould without definitely committing herself to intimate to him that she\nwas prepared to throw in her lot with Labour. The time was ripe and if\nshe was ever to adopt a political career she must come to a decision. A\nmember of the French Academy had been brought by Clifford Boyleston and,\nthough she knew he was wholly unacquainted with English, it had\ngratified her to receive his affable compliment on her ornate and yet\npellucid style. The American Ambassador had been there and a young\nRussian prince whose authentic Romanoff blood alone prevented him from\nlooking a gigolo. A duchess who had recently divorced her duke and\nmarried a jockey had been very gracious; and her strawberry leaves,\nalbeit sere and yellow, undoubtedly added tone to the assembly. There\nhad been quite a galaxy of literary lights. But now all, all were gone\nbut Clifford Boyleston, Harry Oakland, Rose Waterford, Oscar Charles and\nSimmons. Oscar Charles was a little, gnome-like creature, young but with\nthe wizened face of a cunning monkey, with gold spectacles, who earned\nhis living in a government office but spent his leisure in the pursuit\nof literature. He wrote little articles for the sixpenny weeklies and\nhad a spirited contempt for the world in general. Mrs. Albert Forrester\nliked him, thinking he had talent, but though he always expressed the\nkeenest admiration for her style (it was indeed he who had named her the\nmistress of the semi-colon), his acerbity was so general that she also\nsomewhat feared him. Simmons was her agent; a round-faced man who wore\nglasses so strong that his eyes behind them looked strange and\nmisshapen. They reminded you of the eyes of some uncouth crustacean that\nyou had seen in an aquarium. He came regularly to Mrs. Albert\nForrester's parties, partly because he had the greatest admiration for\nher genius and partly because it was convenient for him to meet\nprospective clients in her drawing-room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester, for whom he had long laboured with but a trifling\nrecompense, was not sorry to put him in the way of earning an honest\npenny, and she took care to introduce him, with warm expressions of\ngratitude, to anyone who might be supposed to have literary wares to\nsell. It was not without pride that she remembered that the notorious\nand vastly lucrative memoirs of Lady St. Swithin had been first mooted\nin her drawing-room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey sat in a circle of which Mrs. Albert Forrester was the centre and\ndiscussed brightly and, it must be confessed, somewhat maliciously the\nvarious persons who had been that day present. Miss Warren, the pallid\nfemale who had stood for two hours at the tea-table, was walking\nsilently round the room collecting cups that had been left here and\nthere. She had some vague employment, but was always able to get off in\norder to pour out tea for Mrs. Albert Forrester, and in the evening she\ntyped Mrs. Albert Forrester's manuscripts. Mrs. Albert Forrester did not\npay her for this, thinking quite rightly that as it was she did a great\ndeal for the poor thing; but she gave her the seats for the cinema that\nwere sent her for nothing and often presented her with articles of\nclothing for which she had no further use.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester in her rather deep, full voice was talking in a\nsteady flow and the rest were listening to her with attention. She was\nin good form and the words that poured from her lips could have gone\nstraight down on paper without alteration. Suddenly there was a noise in\nthe passage as though something heavy had fallen and then the sound of\nan altercation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester stopped and a slight frown darkened her really\nnoble brow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have thought they knew by now that I will not have this\ndevastating racket in the flat. Would you mind ringing the bell, Miss\nWarren, and asking what is the reason of this tumult?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Warren rang the bell and in a moment the maid appeared. Miss Warren\nat the door, in order not to interrupt Mrs. Albert Forrester, spoke to\nher in undertones. But Mrs. Albert Forrester somewhat irritably\ninterrupted herself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Carter, what is it? Is the house falling down or has the Red\nRevolution at last broken out?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you please, ma'am, it's the new cook's box,\" answered the maid. \"The\nporter dropped it as he was bringing it in and the cook got all upset\nabout it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean by 'the new cook'?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Bulfinch went away this afternoon, ma'am,\" said the maid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester stared at her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is the first I've heard of it. Had Mrs. Bulfinch given notice? The\nmoment Mr. Forrester comes in tell him that I wish to speak to him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very good, ma'am.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe maid went out and Miss Warren slowly returned to the tea-table.\nMechanically, though nobody wanted them, she poured out several cups of\ntea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a catastrophe!\" cried Miss Waterford.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must get her back,\" said Clifford Boyleston. \"She's a treasure,\nthat woman, a remarkable cook, and she gets better and better every\nday.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut at that moment the maid came in again with a letter on a small\nplated salver and handed it to her mistress.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is this?\" said Mrs. Albert Forrester.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Forrester said I was to give you this letter when you asked for\nhim, ma'am,\" said the maid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where is Mr. Forrester then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Forrester's gone, ma'am,\" answered the maid as though the question\nsurprised her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gone? That'll do. You can go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe maid left the room and Mrs. Albert Forrester, with a look of\nperplexity on her large face, opened the letter. Rose Waterford has told\nme that her first thought was that Albert, fearful of his wife's\ndispleasure at the departure of Mrs. Bulfinch, had thrown himself in the\nThames. Mrs. Albert Forrester read the letter and a look of\nconsternation crossed her face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, monstrous,\" she cried. \"Monstrous! Monstrous!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it, Mrs. Forrester?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester pawed the carpet with her foot like a restive,\nhigh-spirited horse pawing the ground, and crossing her arms with a\ngesture that is indescribable (but that you sometimes see in a fishwife\nwho is going to make the very devil of a scene) bent her looks upon her\ncurious and excessively startled friends.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Albert has eloped with the cook.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a gasp of dismay. Then something terrible happened. Miss\nWarren, who was standing behind the tea-table, suddenly choked. Miss\nWarren, who never opened her mouth and whom no one ever spoke to, Miss\nWarren, whom not one of them, though he had seen her every week for\nthree years, would have recognised in the street, Miss Warren suddenly\nburst into uncontrollable laughter. With one accord, aghast, they turned\nand stared at her. They felt as Balaam must have felt when his ass broke\ninto speech. She positively shrieked with laughter. There was a nameless\nhorror about the sight, as though something had on a sudden gone wrong\nwith a natural phenomenon, and you were just as startled as though the\nchairs and tables without warning began to skip about the floor in an\nantic dance. Miss Warren tried to contain herself, but the more she\ntried the more pitilessly the laughter shook her, and seizing a\nhandkerchief she stuffed it in her mouth and hurried from the room. The\ndoor slammed behind her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hysteria,\" said Clifford Boyleston.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pure hysteria, of course,\" said Harry Oakland.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Mrs. Albert Forrester said nothing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe letter had dropped at her feet and Simmons, the agent, picked it up\nand handed it to her. She would not take it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Read it,\" she said. \"Read it aloud.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Simmons pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and holding the\nletter very close to his eyes read as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <i>My Dear</i>,\n\n<p>\n    <i>Mrs. Bulfinch is in need of a change and has decided to leave,\n    and as I do not feel inclined to stay on here without her I am\n    going too. I have had all the literature I can stand and I am\n    fed up with art.</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    <i>Mrs. Bulfinch does not care about marriage, but if you care to\n    divorce me she is willing to marry me. I hope you will find the\n    new cook satisfactory. She has excellent references. It may save\n    you trouble if I inform you that Mrs. Bulfinch and I are living\n    at 411, Kennington Road, S.E.</i>\n</p>\n\n    <i>Albert.</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nNo one spoke. Mr. Simmons slipped his spectacles back on to the bridge\nof his nose. The fact was that none of them, brilliant as they were and\naccustomed to find topics of conversation to suit every occasion, could\nthink of an appropriate remark. Mrs. Albert Forrester was not the kind\nof woman to whom you could offer condolences and each was too much\nafraid of the other's ridicule to venture upon the obvious. At last\nClifford Boyleston came bravely to the rescue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One doesn't know what to say,\" he observed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was another silence and then Rose Waterford spoke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does Mrs. Bulfinch look like?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How should I know?\" answered Mrs. Albert Forrester, somewhat peevishly.\n\"I have never looked at her. Albert always engaged the servants, she\njust came in for a moment so that I could see if her aura was\nsatisfactory.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But you must have seen her every morning when you did the\nhousekeeping.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Albert did the housekeeping. It was his own wish, so that I might be\nfree to devote myself to my work. In this life one has to limit\noneself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did Albert order your luncheons?\" asked Clifford Boyleston.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Naturally. It was his province.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nClifford Boyleston slightly raised his eyebrows. What a fool he had been\nnever to guess that it was Albert who was responsible for Mrs.\nForrester's beautiful food! And of course it was owing to him that the\nexcellent Chablis was always just sufficiently chilled to run coolly\nover the tongue, but never so cold as to lose its bouquet and its\nsavour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He certainly knew good food and good wine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I always told you he had his points,\" answered Mrs. Albert Forrester,\nas though he were reproaching her. \"You all laughed at him. You would\nnot believe me when I told you that I owed a great deal to him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was no answer to this and once more silence, heavy and ominous,\nfell on the party. Suddenly Mr. Simmons flung a bombshell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must get him back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo great was her surprise that if Mrs. Albert Forrester had not been\nstanding against the chimney-piece she would undoubtedly have staggered\ntwo paces to the rear.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What on earth do you mean?\" she cried. \"I will never see him again as\nlong as I live. Take him back? Never. Not even if he came and begged me\non his bended knees.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't say take him back; I said, get him back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Mrs. Albert Forrester paid no attention to the misplaced\ninterruption.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have done everything for him. What would he be without me? I ask you.\nI have given him a position which never in his remotest dreams could he\nhave aspired to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNone could deny that there was something magnificent in the indignation\nof Mrs. Albert Forrester, but it appeared to have little effect on Mr.\nSimmons.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to live on?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester flung him a glance totally devoid of amiability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"God will provide,\" she answered in freezing tones.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think it very unlikely,\" he returned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester shrugged her shoulders. She wore an outraged\nexpression. But Mr. Simmons made himself as comfortable as he could on\nhis chair and lit a cigarette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know you have no warmer admirer of your art than me,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Than I,\" corrected Clifford Boyleston.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Or than you,\" went on Mr. Simmons blandly. \"We all agree that there is\nno one writing now whom you need fear comparison with. Both in prose and\nverse you are absolutely first class. And your style--well, everyone\nknows your style.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The opulence of Sir Thomas Browne with the limpidity of Cardinal\nNewman,\" said Clifford Boyleston. \"The raciness of John Dryden with the\nprecision of Jonathan Swift.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe only sign that Mrs. Albert Forrester heard was the smile that\nhesitated for a brief moment at the corners of her tragic mouth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And you have humour.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is there anyone in the world,\" cried Miss Waterford, \"who can put such\na wealth of wit and satire and comic observation into a semi-colon?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But the fact remains that you don't sell,\" pursued Mr. Simmons\nimperturbably. \"I've handled your work for twenty years and I tell you\nfrankly that I shouldn't have grown fat on my commission, but I've\nhandled it because now and again I like to do what I can for good work.\nI've always believed in you and I've hoped that sooner or later we might\nget the public to swallow you. But if you think you can make your living\nby writing the sort of stuff you do I'm bound to tell you that you\nhaven't a chance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have come into the world too late,\" said Mrs. Albert Forrester. \"I\nshould have lived in the eighteenth century when the wealthy patron\nrewarded a dedication with a hundred guineas.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you suppose the currant business brings in?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester gave a little sigh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A pittance. Albert always told me he made about twelve hundred a year.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He must be a very good manager. But you couldn't expect him on that\nincome to allow you very much. Take my word for it, there's only one\nthing for you to do and that's to get him back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I would rather live in a garret. Do you think I'm going to submit to\nthe affront he has put upon me? Would you have me battle for his\naffections with my cook? Do not forget that there is one thing which is\nmore valuable to a woman like me than her ease and that is her dignity.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was just coming to that,\" said Mr. Simmons coldly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe glanced at the others and those strange, lopsided eyes of his looked\nmore than ever monstrous and fish-like.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is no doubt in my mind,\" he went on, \"that you have a very\ndistinguished and almost unique position in the world of letters. You\nstand for something quite apart. You never prostituted your genius for\nfilthy lucre and you have held high the banner of pure art. You're\nthinking of going into Parliament. I don't think much of politics\nmyself, but there's no denying that it would be a good advertisement and\nif you get in I daresay we could get you a lecture tour in America on\nthe strength of it. You have ideals and this I can say, that even the\npeople who've never read a word you've written respect you. But in your\nposition there's one thing you can't afford to be and that's a joke.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester gave a distinct start.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What on earth do you mean by that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know nothing about Mrs. Bulfinch and for all I know she's a very\nrespectable woman, but the fact remains that a man doesn't run away with\nhis cook without making his wife ridiculous. If it had been a dancer or\na lady of title I daresay it wouldn't have done you any harm, but a cook\nwould finish you. In a week you'd have all London laughing at you, and\nif there's one thing that kills an author or a politician it is\nridicule. You must get your husband back and you must get him back\npretty damned quick.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA dark flush settled on Mrs. Albert Forrester's face, but she did not\nimmediately reply. In her ears there rang on a sudden the outrageous and\nunaccountable laughter that had sent Miss Warren flying from the room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We're all friends here and you can count on our discretion.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Forrester looked at her friends and she thought that in Rose\nWaterford's eyes there was already a malicious gleam. On the wizened\nface of Oscar Charles was a whimsical look. She wished that in a moment\nof abandon she had not betrayed her secret. Mr. Simmons, however, knew\nthe literary world and allowed his eyes to rest on the company.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After all you are the centre and head of their set. Your husband has\nnot only run away from you but also from them. It's not too good for\nthem either. The fact is that Albert Forrester has made you all look a\nlot of damned fools.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All,\" said Clifford Boyleston. \"We're all in the same boat. He's quite\nright, Mrs. Forrester. The Philatelist must come back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Et tu, Brute.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Simmons did not understand Latin and if he had would probably not\nhave been moved by Mrs. Albert Forrester's exclamation. He cleared his\nthroat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My suggestion is that Mrs. Albert Forrester should go and see him\nto-morrow, fortunately we have his address, and beg him to reconsider\nhis decision. I don't know what sort of things a woman says on these\noccasions, but Mrs. Forrester has tact and imagination and she must say\nthem. If Mr. Forrester makes any conditions she must accept them. She\nmust leave no stone unturned.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you play your cards well there is no reason why you shouldn't bring\nhim back here with you to-morrow evening,\" said Rose Waterford lightly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you do it, Mrs. Forrester?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor two minutes, at least, turned away from them, she stared at the\nempty fireplace; then, drawing herself to her full height, she faced\nthem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For my art's sake, not for mine. I will not allow the ribald laughter\nof the Philistine to besmirch all that I hold good and true and\nbeautiful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Capital,\" said Mr. Simmons, rising to his feet, \"I'll look in on my way\nhome to-morrow and I hope to find you and Mr. Forrester billing and\ncooing side by side like a pair of turtle-doves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took his leave, and the others, anxious not to be left alone with\nMrs. Albert Forrester and her agitation, in a body followed his example.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was latish in the afternoon next day when Mrs. Albert Forrester,\nimposing in black silk and a velvet toque, set out from her flat in\norder to get a bus from the Marble Arch that would take her to Victoria\nStation. Mr. Simmons had explained to her by telephone how to reach the\nKennington Road with expedition and economy. She neither felt nor looked\nlike Delilah. At Victoria she took the tram that runs down the Vauxhall\nBridge Road. When she crossed the river she found herself in a part of\nLondon more noisy, sordid and bustling than that to which she was\naccustomed, but she was too much occupied with her thoughts to notice\nthe varied scene. She was relieved to find that the tram went along the\nKennington Road and asked the conductor to put her down a few doors from\nthe house she sought. When it did and rumbled on leaving her alone in\nthe busy street, she felt strangely lost, like a traveller in an eastern\ntale set down by a djinn in an unknown city. She walked slowly, looking\nto right and left, and notwithstanding the emotions of indignation and\nembarrassment that fought for the possession of her somewhat opulent\nbosom, she could not but reflect that here was the material for a very\npretty piece of prose. The little houses held about them the feeling of\na bygone age when here it was still almost country, and Mrs. Albert\nForrester registered in her retentive memory a note that she must look\ninto the literary associations of the Kennington Road. Number four\nhundred and eleven was one of a row of shabby houses that stood some way\nback from the street; in front of it was a narrow strip of shabby grass,\nand a paved way led up to a latticed wooden porch that badly needed a\ncoat of paint. This and the straggling, stunted creeper that grew over\nthe front of the house gave it a falsely rural air which was strange and\neven sinister in that road down which thundered a tumultuous traffic.\nThere was something equivocal about the house that suggested that here\nlived women to whom a life of pleasure had brought an inadequate reward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe door was opened by a scraggy girl of fifteen with long legs and a\ntousled head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does Mrs. Bulfinch live here, do you know?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've rung the wrong bell. Second floor.\" The girl pointed to the\nstairs and at the same time screamed shrilly: \"Mrs. Bulfinch, a party to\nsee you. Mrs. Bulfinch.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester walked up the dingy stairs. They were covered with\ntorn carpet. She walked slowly, for she did not wish to get out of\nbreath. A door opened as she reached the second floor and she recognised\nher cook.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-afternoon, Bulfinch,\" said Mrs. Albert Forrester, with dignity. \"I\nwish to see your master.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Bulfinch hesitated for the shadow of a second, then held the door\nwide open.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come in, ma'am.\" She turned her head. \"Albert, here's Mrs. Forrester to\nsee you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Forrester stepped by quickly and there was Albert sitting by the\nfire in a leather-covered, but rather shabby, arm-chair, with his feet\nin slippers, and in shirt-sleeves. He was reading the evening paper and\nsmoking a cigar. He rose to his feet as Mrs. Albert Forrester came in.\nMrs. Bulfinch followed her visitor into the room and closed the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How are you, my dear?\" said Albert cheerfully. \"Keeping well, I hope.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd better put on your coat, Albert,\" said Mrs. Bulfinch. \"What\n<i>will</i> Mrs. Forrester think of you, finding you like that? I never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe took the coat, which was hanging on a peg, and helped him into it;\nand like a woman familiar with the peculiarities of masculine dress\npulled down his waistcoat so that it should not ride over his collar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I received your letter, Albert,\" said Mrs. Forrester.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I supposed you had, or you wouldn't have known my address, would you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Won't you sit down, ma'am?\" said Mrs. Bulfinch, deftly dusting a chair,\npart of a suite covered in plum-coloured velvet, and pushing it\nforwards.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester with a slight bow seated herself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have preferred to see you alone, Albert,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis eyes twinkled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Since anything you have to say concerns Mrs. Bulfinch as much as it\nconcerns me I think it much better that she should be present.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As you wish.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Bulfinch drew up a chair and sat down. Mrs. Albert Forrester had\nnever seen her before but with a large apron over a print dress. She was\nwearing now an open-work blouse of white silk, a black skirt, and\nhigh-heeled, patent-leather shoes with silver buckles. She was a woman\nof about five-and-forty, with reddish hair and a reddish face, not\npretty, but with a good-natured look, and buxom. She reminded Mrs.\nAlbert Forrester of a serving-wench, somewhat overblown, in a jolly\npicture by an old Dutch master.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, my dear, what have you to say to me?\" asked Albert.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester gave him her brightest and most affable smile. Her\ngreat black eyes shone with tolerant good-humour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course you know that this is perfectly absurd, Albert. I think you\nmust be out of your mind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you, my dear? Fancy that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not angry with you, I'm only amused, but a joke's a joke and should\nnot be carried too far. I've come to take you home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Was my letter not quite clear?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perfectly. I ask no questions and I will make no reproaches. We will\nlook upon this as a momentary aberration and say no more about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing will induce me ever to live with you again, my dear,\" said\nAlbert in, however, a perfectly friendly fashion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not serious?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you love this woman?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester still smiled with an eager and somewhat metallic\nbrightness. She was determined to take the matter lightly. With her\nintimate sense of values she realised that the scene was comic. Albert\nlooked at Mrs. Bulfinch and a smile broke out on his withered face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We get on very well together, don't we, old girl?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not so bad,\" said Mrs. Bulfinch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester raised her eyebrows; her husband had never in all\ntheir married life called her \"old girl\": nor indeed would she have\nwished it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If Bulfinch has any regard or respect for you she must know that the\nthing is impossible. After the life you've led and the society you've\nmoved in she can hardly expect to make you permanently happy in\nmiserable furnished lodgings.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're not furnished lodgings, ma'am,\" said Mrs. Bulfinch. \"It's all\nme own furniture. You see, I'm very independent-like and I've always\nliked to have a home of me own. So I keep these rooms on whether I'm in\na situation or whether I'm not, and so I always have some place to go\nback to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And a very nice cosy little place it is,\" said Albert.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester looked about her. There was a kitchen range in the\nfireplace on which a kettle was simmering and on the mantelshelf was a\nblack marble clock flanked by black marble candelabra. There was a large\ntable covered with a red cloth, a dresser, and a sewing-machine. On the\nwalls were photographs and framed pictures from Christmas supplements. A\ndoor at the back, covered with a red plush portière, led into what,\nconsidering the size of the house, Mrs. Albert Forrester (who in her\nleisure moments had made a somewhat extensive study of architecture)\ncould not but conclude was the only bedroom. Mrs. Bulfinch and Albert\nlived in a contiguity that allowed no doubt about their relations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you not been happy with me, Albert?\" asked Mrs. Forrester in a\ndeeper tone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We've been married for thirty-five years, my dear. It's too long. It's\na great deal too long. You're a good woman in your way, but you don't\nsuit me. You're literary and I'm not. You're artistic and I'm not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've always taken care to make you share in all my interests. I've\ntaken great pains that you shouldn't be overshadowed by my success. You\ncan't say that I've ever left you out of things.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're a wonderful writer, I don't deny it for a moment, but the truth\nis I don't like the books you write.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That, if I may be permitted to say so, merely shows that you have very\nbad taste. All the best critics admit their power and their charm.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And I don't like your friends. Let me tell you a secret, my dear. Often\nat your parties I've had an almost irresistible impulse to take off all\nmy clothes just to see what would happen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing would have happened,\" said Mrs. Albert Forrester with a slight\nfrown. \"I should merely have sent for the doctor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Besides you haven't the figure for that, Albert,\" said Mrs. Bulfinch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Simmons had hinted to Mrs. Albert Forrester that if the need arose\nshe must not hesitate to use the allurements of her sex in order to\nbring back her erring husband to the conjugal roof, but she did not in\nthe least know how to do this. It would have been easier, she could not\nbut reflect, had she been in evening dress.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does the fidelity of five-and-thirty years count for nothing? I have\nnever looked at another man, Albert. I'm used to you. I shall be lost\nwithout you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've left all my menus with the new cook, ma'am. You've only got to\ntell her how many to luncheon and she'll manage,\" said Mrs. Bulfinch.\n\"She's very reliable and she has as light a hand with pastry as anyone I\never knew.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester began to be discouraged. Mrs. Bulfinch's remark,\nwell-meant no doubt, made it difficult to bring the conversation on to\nthe plane on which emotion could be natural.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid you're only wasting your time, my dear,\" said Albert. \"My\ndecision is irrevocable. I'm not very young any more and I want someone\nto take care of me. I shall of course make you as good an allowance as I\ncan. Corinne wants me to retire.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is Corinne?\" asked Mrs. Forrester with the utmost surprise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's my name,\" said Mrs. Bulfinch. \"My mother was half French.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That explains a great deal,\" replied Mrs. Forrester, pursing her lips,\nfor though she admired the literature of our neighbours she knew that\ntheir morals left much to be desired.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What I say is, Albert's worked long enough, and it's about time he\nstarted enjoying himself. I've got a little bit of property at\nClacton-on-Sea. It's a very healthy neighbourhood and the air is\nwonderful. We could live there very comfortable. And what with the beach\nand the pier there's always something to do. They're a very nice lot of\npeople down there. If you don't interfere with nobody, nobody'll\ninterfere with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I discussed the matter with my partners to-day and they're willing to\nbuy me out. It means a certain sacrifice. When everything is settled I\nshall have an income of nine hundred pounds a year. There are three of\nus, so it gives us just three hundred a year apiece.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How am I to live on that?\" cried Mrs. Albert Forrester. \"I have my\nposition to keep up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You have a fluent, a fertile and a distinguished pen, my dear.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester impatiently shrugged her shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know very well that my books don't bring me in anything but\nreputation. The publishers always say that they lose by them and in fact\nthey only publish them because it gives them prestige.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was then that Mrs. Bulfinch had the idea that was to have\nconsequences of such magnitude.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why don't you write a good thrilling detective story?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Me?\" exclaimed Mrs. Albert Forrester, for the first time in her life\nregardless of grammar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not a bad idea,\" said Albert. \"It's not a bad idea at all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have the critics down on me like a thousand of bricks.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not so sure of that. Give the highbrow the chance of being lowbrow\nwithout demeaning himself and he'll be so grateful to you, he won't know\nwhat to do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For this relief much thanks,\" murmured Mrs. Albert Forrester\nreflectively.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear, the critics'll eat it. And written in your beautiful English\nthey won't be afraid to call it a masterpiece.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The idea is preposterous. It's absolutely foreign to my genius. I could\nnever hope to please the masses.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why not? The masses want to read good stuff, but they dislike being\nbored. They all know your name, but they don't read you, because you\nbore them. The fact is, my dear, you're dull.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know how you can say that, Albert,\" replied Mrs. Albert\nForrester, with as little resentment as the equator might feel if\nsomeone called it chilly. \"Everyone knows and acknowledges that I have\nan exquisite sense of humour and there is nobody who can extract so much\ngood wholesome fun from a semi-colon as I can.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you can give the masses a good thrilling story and let them think at\nthe same time that they are improving their minds you'll make a\nfortune.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've never read a detective story in my life,\" said Mrs. Albert\nForrester. \"I once heard of a Mr. Barnes of New York and I was told that\nhe had written a book called <i>The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</i>. But I never\nread it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course you have to have the knack,\" said Mrs. Bulfinch. \"The first\nthing to remember is that you don't want any love-making, it's out of\nplace in a detective story, what you want is murder, and sleuth-hounds,\nand you don't want to be able to guess who done it till the last page.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But you must play fair with your reader, my dear,\" said Albert. \"It\nalways annoys me when suspicion has been thrown on the secretary or the\nlady of title and it turns out to be the second footman who's never done\nmore than say, 'The carriage is at the door.' Puzzle your reader as much\nas you can, but don't make a fool of him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I love a good detective story,\" said Mrs. Bulfinch. \"Give me a lady in\nevening dress, just streaming with diamonds, lying on the library floor\nwith a dagger in her heart, and I know I'm going to have a treat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no accounting for tastes,\" said Albert. \"Personally, I prefer a\nrespectable family solicitor, with side-whiskers, gold watch-chain, and\na benign appearance, lying dead in Hyde Park.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"With his throat cut?\" asked Mrs. Bulfinch eagerly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, stabbed in the back. There's something peculiarly attractive to the\nreader in the murder of a middle-aged gentleman of spotless reputation.\nIt is pleasant to think that the most apparently blameless of us have a\nmystery in our lives.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see what you mean, Albert,\" said Mrs. Bulfinch. \"He was the\nrepository of a fatal secret.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We can give you all the tips, my dear,\" said Albert, smiling mildly at\nMrs. Albert Forrester. \"I've read hundreds of detective stories.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's what first brought Corinne and me together. I used to pass them\non to her when I'd finished them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Many's the time I've heard him switch off the electric light as the\ndawn was creeping through the window and I couldn't help smiling to\nmyself as I said: 'There, he's finished it at last, now he can have a\ngood sleep.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester rose to her feet. She drew herself up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now I see what a gulf separates us,\" she said, and her fine contralto\nshook a little. \"You have been surrounded for thirty years with all that\nwas best in English literature and you read hundreds of detective\nnovels.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hundreds and hundreds,\" interrupted Albert with a smile of\nsatisfaction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I came here willing to make any reasonable concession so that you\nshould come back to your home, but now I wish it no longer. You have\nshown me that we have nothing in common and never had. There is an abyss\nbetween us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well, my dear,\" said Albert gently, \"I will submit to your\ndecision. But you think over the detective story.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will arise and go now,\" she murmured, \"and go to Innisfree.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll just show you downstairs,\" said Mrs. Bulfinch. \"One has to be\ncareful of the carpet if one doesn't exactly know where the holes are.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith dignity, but not without circumspection, Mrs. Albert Forrester\nwalked downstairs and when Mrs. Bulfinch opened the door and asked her\nif she would like a taxi she shook her head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall take the tram.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You need not be afraid that I won't take good care of Mr. Forrester,\nma'am,\" said Mrs. Bulfinch pleasantly. \"He shall have every comfort. I\nnursed Mr. Bulfinch for three years during his last illness and there's\nvery little I don't know about invalids. Not that Mr. Forrester isn't\nvery strong and active for his years. And of course he'll have a hobby.\nI always think a man should have a hobby. He's going to collect\npostage-stamps.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester gave a little start of surprise. But just then a\ntram came in sight and, as a woman (even the greatest of them) will, she\nhurried at the risk of her life into the middle of the road and waved\nfrantically. It stopped and she climbed in. She did not know how she was\ngoing to face Mr. Simmons. He would be waiting for her when she got\nhome. Clifford Boyleston would probably be there too. They would all be\nthere and she would have to tell them that she had miserably failed. At\nthat moment she had no warm feeling of friendship for her little group\nof devoted admirers. Wondering what the time was, she looked up at the\nman sitting opposite her to see whether he was the kind of person she\ncould modestly ask, and suddenly started; for sitting there was a\nmiddle-aged gentleman of the most respectable appearance, with\nside-whiskers, a benign expression and a gold watch-chain. It was the\nvery man whom Albert had described lying dead in Hyde Park and she could\nnot but jump to the conclusion that he was a family solicitor. The\ncoincidence was extraordinary and really it looked as though the hand of\nfate were beckoning to her. He wore a silk hat, a black coat and\npepper-and-salt trousers, he was somewhat corpulent, of a powerful\nbuild, and by his side was a despatch-case. When the tram was half-way\ndown the Vauxhall Bridge Road he asked the conductor to stop and she saw\nhim go down a small, mean street. Why? Ah, why? When it reached\nVictoria, so deeply immersed in thought was she, until the conductor\nsomewhat roughly told her where she was, she did not move. Edgar Allan\nPoe had written detective stories. She took a bus. She sat inside,\nburied in reflection, but when it arrived at Hyde Park Corner she\nsuddenly made up her mind to get out. She couldn't sit still any longer.\nShe felt she must walk. She entered the gates, walking slowly, and\nlooked about her with an air that was at once intent and abstracted.\nYes, there was Edgar Allan Poe; no one could deny that. After all he had\ninvented the genre, and everyone knew how great his influence had been\non the Parnassians. Or was it the Symbolists? Never mind. Baudelaire and\nall that. As she passed the Achilles Statue she stopped for a minute and\nlooked at it with raised eyebrows.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt length she reached her flat and opening the door saw several hats in\nthe hall. They were all there. She went into the drawing-room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Here she is at last,\" cried Miss Waterford.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Albert Forrester advanced, smiling with animation, and shook the\nproffered hands. Mr. Simmons and Clifford Boyleston were there, Harry\nOakland and Oscar Charles.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, you poor things, have you had no tea?\" she cried brightly. \"I\nhaven't an idea what the time is, but I know I'm fearfully late.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well?\" they said. \"Well?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dears, I've got something quite wonderful to tell you. I've had an\ninspiration. Why should the devil have all the best tunes?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What <i>do</i> you mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe paused in order to give full effect to the surprise she was going to\nspring upon them. Then she flung it at them without preamble.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'M GOING TO WRITE A DETECTIVE STORY.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey stared at her with open mouths. She held up her hand to prevent\nthem from interrupting her, but indeed no one had the smallest intention\nof doing so.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am going to raise the detective story to the dignity of Art. It came\nto me suddenly in Hyde Park. It's a murder story and I shall give the\nsolution on the very last page. I shall write it in an impeccable\nEnglish, and since it's occurred to me lately that perhaps I've\nexhausted the possibilities of the semi-colon, I am going to take up the\ncolon. No one yet has explored its potentialities. Humour and mystery\nare what I aim at. I shall call it <i>The Achilles Statue</i>.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a title!\" cried Mr. Simmons, recovering himself before any of the\nothers. \"I can sell the serial rights on the title and your name alone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what about Albert?\" asked Clifford Boyleston.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Albert?\" echoed Mrs. Forrester. \"Albert?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him as though for the life of her she could not think what\nhe was talking about. Then she gave a little cry as if she had suddenly\nremembered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Albert! I knew I'd gone out on some errand and it absolutely slipped my\nmemory. I was walking through Hyde Park and I had this inspiration. What\na fool you'll all think me!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then you haven't seen Albert?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear, I forgot all about him.\" She gave an amused laugh. \"Let Albert\nkeep his cook. I can't bother about Albert now. Albert belongs to the\nsemi-colon period. I am going to write a detective story.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear, you're too, too wonderful,\" said Harry Oakland.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThere are few things better than a good Havana. When I was young and\nvery poor and smoked a cigar only when somebody gave me one, I\ndetermined that if ever I had money I would smoke a cigar every day\nafter luncheon and after dinner. This is the only resolution of my youth\nthat I have kept. It is the only ambition I have achieved that has never\nbeen embittered by disillusion. I like a cigar that is mild, but\nfull-flavoured, neither so small that it is finished before you have\nbecome aware of it nor so large as to be irksome, rolled so that it\ndraws without consciousness of effort on your part, with a leaf so firm\nthat it doesn't become messy on your lips and in such condition that it\nkeeps its savour to the very end. But when you have taken the last pull\nand put down the shapeless stump and watched the final cloud of smoke\ndwindle blue in the surrounding air it is impossible, if you have a\nsensitive nature, not to feel a certain melancholy at the thought of all\nthe labour, the care and pains that have gone, the thought, the trouble,\nthe complicated organisation that have been required to provide you with\nhalf an hour's delight. For this men have sweltered long years under\ntropical suns and ships have scoured the seven seas. These reflections\nbecome more poignant still when you are eating a dozen oysters (with\nhalf a bottle of dry white wine) and they become almost unbearable when\nit comes to a lamb cutlet. For these are animals and there is something\nthat inspires awe in the thought that since the surface of the earth\nbecame capable of supporting life from generation to generation for\nmillions upon millions of years creatures have come into existence to\nend at last upon a plate of crushed ice or on a silver grill. It may be\nthat a sluggish fancy cannot grasp the dreadful solemnity of eating an\noyster and evolution has taught us that the bivalve has through the ages\nkept itself to itself in a manner that inevitably alienates sympathy.\nThere is an aloofness in it that is offensive to the aspiring spirit of\nman and a self-complacency that is obnoxious to his vanity. But I do not\nknow how anyone can look upon a lamb cutlet without thoughts too deep\nfor tears: here man himself has taken a hand and the history of the race\nis bound up with the tender morsel on your plate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd sometimes even the fate of human beings is curious to consider. It\nis strange to look upon this man or that, the quiet ordinary persons of\nevery day, the bank clerk, the dustman, the middle-aged girl in the\nsecond row of the chorus, and think of the interminable history behind\nthem and of the long, long series of hazards by which from the primeval\nslime the course of events has brought them at this moment to such and\nsuch a place. When such tremendous vicissitudes have been needed to get\nthem here at all one would have thought some huge significance must be\nattached to them; one would have thought that what befell them must\nmatter a little to the Life Spirit or whatever else it is that has\nproduced them. An accident befalls them. The thread is broken. The story\nthat began with the world is finished abruptly and it looks as though it\nmeant nothing at all. A tale told by an idiot. And is it not odd that\nthis event, of an importance so dramatic, may be brought about by a\ncause so trivial?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAn incident of no moment, that might easily not have happened, has\nconsequences that are incalculable. It looks as though blind chance\nruled all things. Our smallest actions may affect profoundly the whole\nlives of people who have nothing to do with us. The story I have to tell\nwould never have happened if one day I had not walked across the street.\nLife is really very fantastic and one has to have a peculiar sense of\nhumour to see the fun of it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was strolling down Bond Street one spring morning and having nothing\nmuch to do till lunch-time thought I would look in at Sotheby's, the\nauction rooms, to see whether there was anything on show that interested\nme. There was a block in the traffic and I threaded my way through the\ncars. When I reached the other side I ran into a man I had known in\nBorneo coming out of a hatter's.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hullo, Morton,\" I said. \"When did you come home?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've been back about a week.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was a District Officer. The Governor had given me a letter of\nintroduction to him and I wrote and told him I meant to spend a week at\nthe place he lived at and should like to put up at the government\nrest-house. He met me on the ship when I arrived and asked me to stay\nwith him. I demurred. I did not see how I could spend a week with a\ntotal stranger, I did not want to put him to the expense of my board,\nand besides I thought I should have more freedom if I were on my own. He\nwould not listen to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got plenty of room,\" he said, \"and the rest-house is beastly. I\nhaven't spoken to a white man for six months and I'm fed to the teeth\nwith my own company.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut when Morton had got me and his launch had landed us at the bungalow\nand he had offered me a drink he did not in the least know what to do\nwith me. He was seized on a sudden with shyness and his conversation,\nwhich had been fluent and ready, ran dry. I did my best to make him feel\nat home (it was the least I could do, considering that it was his own\nhouse) and asked him if he had any new records. He turned on the\ngramophone and the sound of rag-time gave him confidence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis bungalow overlooked the river and his living-room was a large\nverandah. It was furnished in the impersonal fashion that characterised\nthe dwellings of government officials who were moved here and there at\nlittle notice according to the exigencies of the service. There were\nnative hats as ornaments on the walls and the horns of animals,\nblow-pipes and spears. In the book-shelf were detective novels and old\nmagazines. There was a cottage piano with yellow keys. It was very\nuntidy, but not uncomfortable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nUnfortunately I cannot very well remember what he looked like. He was\nyoung, twenty-eight, I learnt later, and he had a boyish and attractive\nsmile. I spent an agreeable week with him. We went up and down the river\nand we climbed a mountain. We had tiffin one day with some planters who\nlived twenty miles away and every evening we went to the club. The only\nmembers were the managers of a kutch factory and his assistants, but\nthey were not on speaking terms with one another and it was only on\nMorton's representations that they must not let him down when he had a\nvisitor that we could get up a rubber of bridge. The atmosphere was\nstrained. We came back to dinner, listened to the gramophone and went to\nbed. Morton had little office work and one would have thought the time\nhung heavy on his hands, but he had energy and high spirits; it was his\nfirst post of the sort and he was happy to be independent. His only\nanxiety was lest he should be transferred before he had finished a road\nhe was building. This was the joy of his heart. It was his own idea and\nhe had wheedled the government into giving him the money to make it; he\nhad surveyed the country himself and traced the path. He had solved\nunaided the technical problems that presented themselves. Every morning,\nbefore he went to his office, he drove out in a rickety old Ford to\nwhere the coolies were working and watched the progress that had been\nmade since the day before. He thought of nothing else. He dreamt of it\nat night. He reckoned that it would be finished in a year and he did not\nwant to take his leave till then. He could not have worked with more\nzest if he had been a painter or a sculptor creating a work of art. I\nthink it was this eagerness that made me take a fancy to him. I liked\nhis zeal. I liked his ingenuousness. And I was impressed by the passion\nfor achievement that made him indifferent to the solitariness of his\nlife, to promotion and even to the thought of going home. I forget how\nlong the road was, fifteen or twenty miles, I think, and I forget what\npurpose it was to serve. I don't believe Morton cared very much. His\npassion was the artist's and his triumph was the triumph of man over\nnature. He learnt as he went along. He had the jungle to contend\nagainst, torrential rains that destroyed the labour of weeks, accidents\nof topography; he had to collect his labour and hold it together; he had\ninadequate funds. His imagination sustained him. His labours gained a\nsort of epic quality and the vicissitudes of the work were a great saga\nthat unrolled itself with an infinity of episodes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis only complaint was that the day was too short. He had office duties,\nhe was judge and tax collector, father and mother (at twenty-eight) of\nthe people in his district; he had now and then to make tours that took\nhim away from home. Unless he was on the spot nothing was done. He would\nhave liked to be there twenty-four hours a day driving the reluctant\ncoolies to further effort. It so happened that shortly before I arrived\nan incident had occurred that filled him with jubilation. He had offered\na contract to a Chinese to make a certain section of the road and the\nChinese had asked more than Morton could afford to pay. Notwithstanding\ninterminable discussions they had been unable to arrive at an agreement\nand Morton with rage in his heart saw his work held up. He was at his\nwits' end. Then going down to his office one morning, he heard that\nthere had been a row in one of the Chinese gambling houses the night\nbefore. A coolie had been badly wounded and his assailant was under\narrest. This assailant was the contractor. He was brought into court,\nthe evidence was clear and Morton sentenced him to eighteen months' hard\nlabour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now he'll have to build the blasted road for nothing,\" said Morton, his\neyes glistening when he told me the story.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe saw the fellow at work one morning, in the prison sarong,\nunconcerned. He was taking his misfortunes in good part.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've told him I'll remit the rest of his sentence when the road's\nfinished,\" said Morton, \"and he's as pleased as Punch. Bit of a snip for\nme, eh, what?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen I left Morton I asked him to let me know when he came to England\nand he promised to write to me as soon as he landed. On the spur of the\nmoment one gives these invitations and one is perfectly sincere about\nthem. But when one is taken at one's word a slight dismay seizes one.\nPeople are so different at home from what they are abroad. There they\nare easy, cordial and natural. They have interesting things to tell you.\nThey are immensely kind. You are anxious when your turn comes to do\nsomething in return for the hospitality you have received. But it is not\neasy. The persons who were so entertaining in their own surroundings are\nvery dull in yours. They are constrained and shy. You introduce them to\nyour friends and your friends find them a crashing bore. They do their\nbest to be civil, but sigh with relief when the strangers go and the\nconversation can once more run easily in its accustomed channels. I\nthink the residents in far places early in their careers understand the\nsituation pretty well, as the result maybe of bitter and humiliating\nexperiences, for I have found that they seldom take advantage of the\ninvitation which on some outstation on the edge of the jungle has been\nso cordially extended to them and by them as cordially accepted. But\nMorton was different. He was a young man and single. It is generally the\nwives that are the difficulty; other women look at their drab clothes,\nin a glance take in their provincial air, and freeze them with their\nindifference. But a man can play bridge and tennis, and dance. Morton\nhad charm. I had had no doubt that in a day or two he would find his\nfeet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why didn't you let me know you were back?\" I asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought you wouldn't want to be bothered with me,\" he smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What nonsense!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course now as we stood in Bond Street on the kerb and chatted for a\nminute he looked strange to me. I had never seen him in anything but\nkhaki shorts and a tennis shirt, except when we got back from the club\nat night and he put on a pyjama jacket and a sarong for dinner. It is as\ncomfortable a form of evening dress as has ever been devised. He looked\na bit awkward in his blue serge suit. His face against a white collar\nwas very brown.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How about the road?\" I asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Finished. I was afraid I'd have to postpone my leave, we struck one or\ntwo snags towards the end, but I made 'em hustle and the day before I\nleft I drove the Ford to the end and back without stopping.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI laughed. His pleasure was charming.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What have you been doing with yourself in London?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Buying clothes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Been having a good time?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Marvellous. A bit lonely, you know, but I don't mind that. I've been to\na show every night. The Palmers, you know, I think you met them in\nSarawak, were going to be in town and we were going to do the play\ntogether, but they had to go to Scotland because her mother's ill.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis words, said so breezily, cut me to the quick. His was the common\nexperience. It was heartbreaking. For months, for long months before it\nwas due, these people planned their leave and when they got off the ship\nthey were in such spirits they could hardly contain themselves. London.\nShops and clubs and theatres and restaurants. London. They were going to\nhave the time of their lives. London. It swallowed them. A strange\nturbulent city, not hostile but indifferent, and they were lost in it.\nThey had no friends. They had nothing in common with the acquaintances\nthey made. They were more lonely than in the jungle. It was a relief\nwhen at a theatre they ran across someone they had known in the East\n(and perhaps been bored stiff by or disliked) and they could fix up an\nevening together and have a good laugh and tell one another what a grand\ntime they were having and talk of common friends and at last confide to\none another a little shyly that they would not be sorry when their leave\nwas up and they were once again in harness. They went to see their\nfamilies and of course they were glad to see them, but it wasn't the\nsame as it had been, they did feel a bit out of it, and when you came\ndown to brass tacks the life people led in England was deadly. It was\ngrand fun to come home, but you couldn't live there any more, and\nsometimes you thought of your bungalow overlooking the river and your\ntours of the district and what a lark it was to run over once in a blue\nmoon to Sandakan or Kuching or Singapore.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd because I remembered what Morton had looked forward to when, the\nroad finished and off his chest, he went on leave I could not but feel a\npang when I thought of him dining by himself in a dismal club where he\nknew nobody or alone in a restaurant in Soho and then going off to see a\nplay with no one by his side with whom he could enjoy it and no one to\nhave a drink with during the interval. And at the same time I reflected\nthat even if I had known he was in London I could have done nothing much\nfor him, for during the last week I had not had a moment free. That very\nevening I was dining with friends and going to a play, and the next day\nI was going abroad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you doing to-night?\" I asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going to the Pavilion. It's packed jammed full, but there's a\nfellow over the road who's wonderful and he's got me a ticket that had\nbeen returned. You can often get one seat, you know, when you can't get\ntwo.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why don't you come and have supper with me? I'm taking some people to\nthe Haymarket and we're going on to Ciro's afterwards.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd love to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe arranged to meet at eleven and I left him to keep an engagement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was afraid the friends I had asked him to meet would not amuse Morton\nvery much, for they were distinctly middle-aged, but I could not think\nof anyone young that at this season of the year I should be likely to\nget hold of at the last moment. None of the girls I knew would thank me\nfor asking her to supper to dance with a shy young man from Malaya. I\ncould trust the Bishops to do their best for him, and after all it must\nbe jollier for him to have supper in a club with a good band where he\ncould see pretty women dancing than to go home to bed at eleven because\nhe had nowhere else in the world to go. I had known Charlie Bishop first\nwhen I was a medical student. He was then a thin little fellow with\nsandy hair and blunt features; he had fine eyes, dark and gleaming, but\nhe wore spectacles. He had a round, merry, red face. He was very fond of\nthe girls. I suppose he had a way with him, for with no money and no\nlooks, he managed to pick up a succession of young persons who gratified\nhis roving desires. He was clever and bumptious, argumentative and\nquick-tempered. He had a caustic tongue. Looking back, I should say he\nwas a rather disagreeable young man, but I do not think he was a bore.\nNow, half-way through the fifties, he was inclined to be stout and he\nwas very bald, but his eyes behind the gold-rimmed spectacles were still\nbright and alert. He was dogmatic and somewhat conceited, argumentative\nstill and caustic, but he was good-natured and amusing. After you have\nknown a person so long his idiosyncrasies cease to trouble you. You\naccept them as you accept your own physical defects. He was by\nprofession a pathologist and now and then he sent me a slim book he had\njust published. It was severe and extremely technical and grimly\nillustrated with photographs of bacteria. I did not read it. I gathered\nfrom what I sometimes heard that Charlie's views on the subjects with\nwhich he dealt were unsound. I do not believe that he was very popular\nwith the other members of his profession, he made no secret of the fact\nthat he looked upon them as a set of incompetent idiots; but he had his\njob, it brought him in six or eight hundred a year, I think, and he was\ncompletely indifferent to other people's opinion of him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI liked Charlie Bishop because I had known him for thirty years, but I\nliked Margery, his wife, because she was very nice. I was extremely\nsurprised when he told me he was going to be married. He was hard on\nforty at the time and so fickle in his affections that I had made up my\nmind he would remain single. He was very fond of women, but he was not\nin the least sentimental, and his aims were loose. His views on the\nfemale sex would in these idealistic days be thought crude. He knew what\nhe wanted and he asked for it, and if he couldn't get it for love or\nmoney he shrugged his shoulders and went his way. To be brief, he did\nnot look to women to gratify his ideal but to provide him with\nfornication. It was odd that though small and plain he found so many who\nwere prepared to grant his wishes. For his spiritual needs he found\nsatisfaction in unicellular organisms. He had always been a man who\nspoke to the point, and when he told me he was going to marry a young\nwoman called Margery Hobson I did not hesitate to ask him why. He\ngrinned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Three reasons. First, she won't let me go to bed with her without.\nSecond, she makes me laugh like a hyena. And third, she's alone in the\nworld, without a single relation, and she must have someone to take care\nof her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The first reason is just swank and the second is eyewash. The third is\nthe real one and it means that she's got you by the short hairs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis eyes gleamed softly behind his large spectacles.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shouldn't be surprised if you weren't dead right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's not only got you by the short hairs but you're as pleased as\nPunch that she has.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come and lunch to-morrow and have a look at her. She's easy on the\neye.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCharlie was a member of a cock-and-hen club which at that time I used a\ngood deal and we arranged to lunch there. I found Margery a very\nattractive young woman. She was then just under thirty. She was a lady.\nI noticed the fact with satisfaction, but with a certain astonishment,\nfor it had not escaped my notice that Charlie was attracted as a rule by\nwomen whose breeding left something to be desired. She was not\nbeautiful, but comely, with fine dark hair and fine eyes, a good colour\nand a look of health. She had a pleasant frankness and an air of candour\nthat were very taking. She looked honest, simple and dependable. I took\nan immediate liking to her. She was easy to talk to and though she did\nnot say anything very brilliant she understood what other people were\ntalking about; she was quick to see a joke and she was not shy. She gave\nyou the impression of being competent and business-like. She had a happy\nplacidity that suggested a good temper and an excellent digestion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey seemed extremely pleased with one another. I had asked myself when\nI first saw her why Margery was marrying this irritable little man,\nbaldish already and by no means young, but I discovered very soon that\nit was because she was in love with him. They chaffed one another a good\ndeal and laughed a lot and every now and then their eyes met more\nsignificantly and they seemed to exchange a little private message. It\nwas really rather touching.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA week later they were married at a registrar's office. It was a very\nsuccessful marriage. Looking back now after sixteen years I could not\nbut chuckle sympathetically at the thought of the lark they had made of\ntheir life together. I had never known a more devoted couple. They had\nnever had very much money. They never seemed to want any. They had no\nambitions. Their life was a picnic that never came to an end. They lived\nin the smallest flat I ever saw, in Panton Street, a small bedroom, a\nsmall sitting-room and a bathroom that served also as a kitchen. But\nthey had no sense of home, they ate their meals in restaurants, and only\nhad breakfast in the flat. It was merely a place to sleep in. It was\ncomfortable, though a third person coming in for a whisky and soda\ncrowded it, and Margery with the help of a charwoman kept it as neat as\nCharlie's untidiness permitted, but there was not a single thing in it\nthat had a personal note. They had a tiny car and whenever Charlie had a\nholiday they took it across the Channel and started off, with a bag each\nfor all their luggage, to drive wherever the fancy took them. Breakdowns\nnever disturbed them, bad weather was part of the fun, a puncture was no\nend of a joke and if they lost their way and had to sleep out in the\nopen they thought they were having the time of their lives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCharlie continued to be irascible and contentious, but nothing he did\never disturbed Margery's lovely placidity. She could calm him with a\nword. She still made him laugh. She typed his monographs on obscure\nbacteria and corrected the proofs of his articles in the scientific\nmagazines. Once I asked them if they ever quarrelled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No,\" she said, \"we never seem to have anything to quarrel about.\nCharlie has the temper of an angel.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nonsense,\" I said, \"he's an overbearing, aggressive and cantankerous\nfellow. He always has been.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him and giggled and I saw that she thought I was being\nfunny.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let him rave,\" said Charlie. \"He's an ignorant fool and he uses words\nof whose meaning he hasn't the smallest idea.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were sweet together. They were very happy in one another's company\nand were never apart if they could help it. Even after the long time\nthey had been married Charlie used to get into the car every day at\nluncheon-time to come west and meet Margery at a restaurant. People used\nto laugh at them, not unkindly, but perhaps with a little catch in the\nthroat, because when they were asked to go and spend a week-end in the\ncountry Margery would write to the hostess and say they would like to\ncome if they could be given a double bed. They had slept together for so\nmany years that neither of them could sleep alone. It was often a trifle\nawkward. Husbands and wives as a rule not only demanded separate rooms,\nbut were inclined to be peevish if asked to share the same bathroom.\nModern houses were not arranged for domestic couples, but among their\nfriends it became an understood thing that if you wanted the Bishops you\nmust give them a room with a double bed. Some people of course thought\nit a little indecent, and it was never convenient, but they were a\npleasant pair to have to stay and it was worth while to put up with\ntheir crankiness. Charlie was always full of spirits and in his caustic\nway extremely amusing and Margery was peaceful and easy. They were no\ntrouble to entertain. Nothing pleased them more than to be left to go\nout together for a long ramble in the country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen a man marries, his wife sooner or later estranges him from his old\nfriends, but Margery on the contrary increased Charlie's intimacy with\nthem. By making him more tolerant she made him a more agreeable\ncompanion. They gave you the impression not of a married couple, but,\nrather amusingly, of two middle-aged bachelors living together; and when\nMargery, as was the rule, found herself the only woman among half a\ndozen men, ribald, argumentative and gay, she was not a bar to\ngood-fellowship but an asset. Whenever I was in England I saw them. They\ngenerally dined at the club of which I have spoken and if I happened to\nbe alone I joined them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen we met that evening for a snack before going to the play I told\nthem I had asked Morton to come to supper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid you'll find him rather dull,\" I said. \"But he's a very\ndecent sort of boy and he was awfully kind to me when I was in Borneo.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why didn't you let me know sooner?\" cried Margery. \"I'd have brought a\ngirl along.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you want a girl for?\" said Charlie. \"There'll be you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think it can be much fun for a young man to dance with a woman\nof my advanced years,\" said Margery.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Rot. What's your age got to do with it?\" He turned to me. \"Have you\never danced with anyone who danced better?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had, but she certainly danced very well. She was light on her feet and\nshe had a good sense of rhythm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never,\" I said heartily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMorton was waiting for us when we reached Ciro's. He looked very\nsunburned in his evening clothes. Perhaps it was because I knew that\nthey had been wrapped away in a tin box with moth balls for four years\nthat I felt he did not look quite at home in them. He was certainly more\nat ease in khaki shorts. Charlie Bishop was a good talker and liked to\nhear himself speak. Morton was shy. I gave him a cocktail and ordered\nsome champagne. I had a feeling that he would be glad to dance, but was\nnot quite sure whether it would occur to him to ask Margery. I was\nacutely conscious that we all belonged to another generation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I should tell you that Mrs. Bishop is a beautiful dancer,\" I\nsaid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is she?\" He flushed a little. \"Will you dance with me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe got up and they took the floor. She was looking peculiarly nice that\nevening, not at all smart, and I do not think her plain black dress had\ncost more than six guineas, but she looked a lady. She had the advantage\nof having extremely good legs and at that time skirts were still being\nworn very short. I suppose she had a little make-up on, but in contrast\nwith the other women there she looked very natural. Shingled hair suited\nher; it was not even touched with white and it had an attractive sheen.\nShe was not a pretty woman, but her kindliness, her wholesome air, her\ngood health gave you, if not the illusion that she was, at least the\nfeeling that it didn't at all matter. When she came back to the table\nher eyes were bright and she had a heightened colour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How does he dance?\" asked her husband.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Divinely.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're very easy to dance with,\" said Morton.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCharlie went on with his discourse. He had a sardonic humour and he was\ninteresting because he was himself so interested in what he said. But he\nspoke of things that Morton knew nothing about and though he listened\nwith a civil show of interest I could see that he was too much excited\nby the gaiety of the scene, the music and the champagne to give his\nattention to conversation. When the music struck up again his eyes\nimmediately sought Margery's. Charles caught the look and smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dance with him, Margery. Good for my figure to see you take exercise.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey set off again and for a moment Charlie watched her with fond eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Margery's having the time of her life. She loves dancing and it makes\nme puff and blow. Not a bad youth.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy little party was quite a success and when Morton and I, having taken\nleave of the Bishops, walked together towards Piccadilly Circus he\nthanked me warmly. He had really enjoyed himself. I said good-bye to\nhim. Next morning I went abroad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was sorry not to have been able to do more for Morton and I knew that\nwhen I returned he would be on his way back to Borneo. I gave him a\npassing thought now and then, but by the autumn when I got home he had\nslipped my memory. After I had been in London a week or so I happened to\ndrop in one night at the club to which Charlie Bishop also belonged. He\nwas sitting with three or four men I knew and I went up. I had not seen\nany of them since my return. One of them, a man called Bill Marsh, whose\nwife, Janet, was a great friend of mine, asked me to have a drink.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where have you sprung from?\" asked Charlie. \"Haven't seen you about\nlately.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI noticed at once that he was drunk. I was astonished. Charlie had\nalways liked his liquor, but he carried it well and never exceeded. In\nyears gone by, when we were very young, he got tight occasionally, but\nprobably more than anything to show what a great fellow he was, and it\nis unfair to bring up against a man the excesses of his youth. But I\nremembered that Charlie had never been very nice when he was drunk: his\nnatural aggressiveness was exaggerated then and he talked too much and\ntoo loud; he was very apt to be quarrelsome. He was very dogmatic now,\nlaying down the law and refusing to listen to any of the objections his\nrash statements called forth. The others knew he was drunk and were\nstruggling between the irritation his cantankerousness aroused in them\nand the good-natured tolerance which they felt his condition demanded.\nHe was not an agreeable object. A man of that age, bald and fattish,\nwith spectacles, is disgusting drunk. He was generally rather dapper,\nbut he was untidy now and there was tobacco ash all over him. Charlie\ncalled the waiter and ordered another whisky. The waiter had been at the\nclub for thirty years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got one in front of you, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mind your own damned business,\" said Charlie Bishop. \"Bring me a double\nwhisky right away or I'll report you to the secretary for insolence.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very good, sir,\" said the waiter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCharlie emptied his glass at a gulp, but his hand was unsteady and he\nspilled some of the whisky over himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Charlie, old boy, we'd better be toddling along,\" said Bill\nMarsh. He turned to me. \"Charlie's staying with us for a bit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was more surprised still. But I felt that something was wrong and\nthought it safer not to say anything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm ready,\" said Charlie. \"I'll just have another drink before I go. I\nshall have a better night if I do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt did not look to me as though the party would break up for some time,\nso I got up and announced that I meant to stroll home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say,\" said Bill, as I was about to go, \"you wouldn't come and dine\nwith us to-morrow night, would you, just me and Janet and Charlie?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I'll come with pleasure,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was evident that something was up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Marshes lived in a terrace on the East side of Regent's Park. The\nmaid who opened the door for me asked me to go in to Mr. Marsh's study.\nHe was waiting for me there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought I'd better have a word with you before you went upstairs,\" he\nsaid as he shook hands with me. \"You know Margery's left Charlie?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's taken it very hard. Janet thought it was so awful for him alone in\nthat beastly little flat that we asked him to stay here for a bit. We've\ndone everything we could for him. He's been drinking like a fish. He\nhasn't slept a wink for a fortnight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But she hasn't left him for good?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was astounded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. She's crazy about a fellow called Morton.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Morton. Who's he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt never struck me it was my friend from Borneo.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damn it all, you introduced him and a pretty piece of work you did.\nLet's go upstairs. I thought I'd better put you wise.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe opened the door and we went out. I was thoroughly confused.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But look here,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ask Janet. She knows the whole thing. It beats me. I've got no patience\nwith Margery, and he must be a mess.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe preceded me into the drawing-room. Janet Marsh rose as I entered and\ncame forward to greet me. Charlie was sitting at the window, reading the\nevening paper; he put it aside as I went up to him and shook his hand.\nHe was quite sober and he spoke in his usual rather perky manner, but I\nnoticed that he looked very ill. We had a glass of sherry and went down\nto dinner. Janet was a woman of spirit. She was tall and fair and good\nto look at. She kept the conversation going with alertness. When she\nleft us to drink a glass of port it was with instructions not to stay\nmore than ten minutes. Bill, as a rule somewhat taciturn, exerted\nhimself now to talk. I tumbled to the game. I was hampered by my\nignorance of what exactly had happened, but it was plain that the\nMarshes wanted to prevent Charlie from brooding, and I did my best to\ninterest him. He seemed willing to play his part, he was always fond of\nholding forth, and he discussed, from the pathologist's standpoint, a\nmurder that was just then absorbing the public. But he spoke without\nlife. He was an empty shell, and one had the feeling that though for the\nsake of his host he forced himself to speak, his thoughts were\nelsewhere. It was a relief when a knocking on the floor above indicated\nto us that Janet was getting impatient. This was an occasion when a\nwoman's presence eased the situation. We went upstairs and played family\nbridge. When it was time for me to go Charlie said he would walk with me\nas far as the Marylebone Road.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Charlie, it's so late, you'd much better go to bed,\" said Janet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall sleep better if I have a stroll before turning in,\" he replied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a worried look. You cannot forbid a middle-aged professor\nof pathology from going for a little walk if he wants to. She glanced\nbrightly at her husband.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I daresay it'll do Bill no harm.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI think the remark was tactless. Women are often a little too managing.\nCharlie gave her a sullen look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's absolutely no need to drag Bill out,\" he said with some\nfirmness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't the smallest intention of coming,\" said Bill, smiling. \"I'm\ntired out and I'm going to hit the hay.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI fancy we left Bill Marsh and his wife to a little argument.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They've been frightfully kind to me,\" said Charlie, as we walked along\nby the railings. \"I don't know what I should have done without them. I\nhaven't slept for a fortnight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI expressed regret but did not ask the reason, and we walked for a\nlittle in silence. I presumed that he had come with me in order to talk\nto me of what had happened, but I felt that he must take his own time. I\nwas anxious to show my sympathy, but afraid of saying the wrong thing; I\ndid not want to seem eager to extract confidences from him. I did not\nknow how to give him a lead. I was sure he did not want one. He was not\na man given to beating about the bush. I imagined that he was choosing\nhis words. We reached the corner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll be able to get a taxi at the church,\" he said. \"I'll walk on a\nbit further. Good-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe nodded and slouched off. I was taken aback. There was nothing for me\nto do but to stroll on till I found a cab. I was having my bath next\nmorning when a telephone call dragged me out of it, and with a towel\nround my wet body I took up the receiver. It was Janet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what do you think of it all?\" she said. \"You seem to have kept\nCharlie up pretty late last night. I heard him come home at three.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He left me at the Marylebone Road,\" I answered. \"He said nothing to me\nat all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Didn't he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was something in Janet's voice that suggested that she was\nprepared to have a long talk with me. I suspected she had a telephone by\nthe side of her bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here,\" I said quickly. \"I'm having my bath.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, have you got a telephone in your bathroom?\" she answered eagerly,\nand I think with envy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I haven't.\" I was abrupt and firm. \"And I'm dripping all over the\ncarpet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh!\" I felt disappointment in her tone and a trace of irritation.\n\"Well, when can I see you? Can you come here at twelve?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was inconvenient, but I was not prepared to start an argument.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, good-bye.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI rang off before she could say anything more. In heaven when the\nblessed use the telephone they will say what they have to say and not a\nword beside.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was devoted to Janet, but I knew that there was nothing that thrilled\nher more than the misfortunes of her friends. She was only too anxious\nto help them, but she wanted to be in the thick of their difficulties.\nShe was the friend in adversity. Other people's business was meat and\ndrink to her. You could not enter upon a love affair without finding her\nsomehow your confidante nor be mixed up in a divorce case without\ndiscovering that she too had a finger in the pie. Withal she was a very\nnice woman. I could not help then chuckling in my heart when at noon I\nwas shown in to Janet's drawing-room and observed the subdued eagerness\nwith which she received me. She was very much upset by the catastrophe\nthat had befallen the Bishops, but it was exciting, and she was tickled\nto death to have someone fresh to whom she could tell all about it.\nJanet had just that business-like expectancy that a mother has when she\nis discussing with the family doctor her married daughter's first\nconfinement. Janet was conscious that the matter was very serious, and\nshe would not for a moment have been thought to regard it flippantly,\nbut she was determined to get every ounce of value out of it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I mean, no one could have been more horrified than I was when Margery\ntold me she'd finally made up her mind to leave Charlie,\" she said,\nspeaking with the fluency of a person who has said the same thing in the\nsame words a dozen times at least. \"They were the most devoted couple\nI'd ever known. It was a perfect marriage. They got on like a house on\nfire. Of course Bill and I are devoted to one another, but we have awful\nrows now and then. I mean, I could kill him sometimes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't care a hang about your relations with Bill,\" I said. \"Tell me\nabout the Bishops. That's what I've come here for.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I simply felt I must see you. After all you're the only person who can\nexplain it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, God, don't go on like that. Until Bill told me last night I didn't\nknow a thing about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That was my idea. It suddenly dawned on me that perhaps you didn't know\nand I thought you might put your foot in it too awfully.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Supposing you began at the beginning,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you're the beginning. After all you started the trouble. You\nintroduced the young man. That's why I was so crazy to see you. You know\nall about him. I never saw him. All I know is what Margery has told me\nabout him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At what time are you lunching?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Half-past one.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So am I. Get on with the story.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut my remark had given Janet an idea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, will you get out of your luncheon if I get out of mine. We\ncould have a snack here. I'm sure there's some cold meat in the house,\nand then we needn't hurry. I don't have to be at the hairdresser's till\nthree.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, no, no,\" I said. \"I hate the notion of that. I shall leave here at\ntwenty minutes past one at the latest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then I shall just have to race through it. What do you think of Gerry?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who's Gerry?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gerry Morton. His name's Gerald.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How should I know that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You stayed with him. Weren't there any letters lying about?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I daresay, but I didn't happen to read them,\" I answered somewhat\ntartly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, don't be so stupid. I meant the envelopes. What's he like?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right. Rather the Kipling type, you know. Very keen on his work.\nHearty. Empire-builder and all that sort of thing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't mean that,\" cried Janet, not without impatience. \"I mean, what\ndoes he look like?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"More or less like everybody else, I think. Of course I should recognise\nhim if I saw him again, but I can't picture him to myself very\ndistinctly. He looks clean.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my God,\" said Janet. \"Are you a novelist or are you not? What's the\ncolour of his eyes?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must know. You can't spend a week with anyone without knowing if\ntheir eyes are blue or brown. Is he fair or dark?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Neither.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is he tall or short?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Average, I should say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you trying to irritate me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. He's just ordinary. There's nothing in him to attract your\nattention. He's neither plain nor good-looking. He looks quite decent.\nHe looks a gentleman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Margery says he has a charming smile and a lovely figure.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's absolutely crazy about her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What makes you think that?\" I asked dryly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've seen his letters.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean to say she's shown them to you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, of course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt is always difficult for a man to stomach the want of reticence that\nwomen betray in their private affairs. They have no shame. They will\ntalk to one another without embarrassment of the most intimate matters.\nModesty is a masculine virtue. But though a man may know this\ntheoretically, each time he is confronted with women's lack of reserve\nhe suffers a new shock. I wondered what Morton would think if he knew\nthat not only were his letters read by Janet Marsh as well as by\nMargery, but that she had been kept posted from day to day with the\nprogress of his infatuation. According to Janet he had fallen in love\nwith Margery at first sight. The morning after they had met at my little\nsupper party at Ciro's he had rung up and asked her to come and have tea\nwith him at some place where they could dance. While I listened to\nJanet's story I was conscious of course that she was giving me Margery's\nview of the circumstances and I kept an open mind. I was interested to\nobserve that Janet's sympathies were with Margery. It was true that when\nMargery left her husband it was her idea that Charlie should come to\nthem for two or three weeks rather than stay on in miserable loneliness\nin the deserted flat and she had been extraordinarily kind to him. She\nlunched with him almost every day, because he had been accustomed to\nlunch every day with Margery; she took him for walks in Regent's Park\nand made Bill play golf with him on Sundays. She listened with wonderful\npatience to the story of his unhappiness and did what she could to\nconsole him. She was terribly sorry for him. But all the same she was\ndefinitely on Margery's side and when I expressed my disapproval of her\nshe came down on me like a thousand of bricks. The affair thrilled her.\nShe had been in it from the beginning when Margery, smiling, flattered\nand a little doubtful, came and told her that she had a young man to the\nfinal scene when Margery, exasperated and distraught, announced that she\ncould not stand the strain any more and had packed her things and moved\nout of the flat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course, at first I couldn't believe my ears,\" she said. \"You know\nhow Charlie and Margery were. They simply lived in one another's\npockets. One couldn't help laughing at them, they were so devoted to one\nanother. I never thought him a very nice little man and heaven knows he\nwasn't very attractive physically, but one couldn't help liking him\nbecause he was so awfully nice to Margery. I rather envied her\nsometimes. They had no money and they lived in a hugger-mugger sort of\nway, but they were frightfully happy. Of course I never thought anything\nwould come of it. Margery was rather amused. 'Naturally I don't take it\nvery seriously,' she told me, 'but it is rather fun to have a young man\nat my time of life. I haven't had any flowers sent me for years. I had\nto tell him not to send any more because Charlie would think it so\nsilly. He doesn't know a soul in London and he loves dancing and he says\nI dance like a dream. It's miserable for him going to the theatre by\nhimself all the time and we've done two or three matinées together. It's\npathetic to see how grateful he is when I say I'll go out with him.' 'I\nmust say,' I said, 'he sounds rather a lamb.' 'He is,' she said. 'I knew\nyou'd understand. You don't blame me, do you?' 'Of course not, darling,'\nI said, 'surely you know me better than that. I'd do just the same in\nyour place.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMargery made no secret of her outings with Morton and her husband\nchaffed her good-naturedly about her beau. But he thought him a very\ncivil, pleasant-spoken young man and was glad that Margery had someone\nto play with while he was busy. It never occurred to him to be jealous.\nThe three of them dined together several times and went to a show. But\npresently Gerry Morton begged Margery to spend an evening with him\nalone; she said it was impossible, but he was persuasive, he gave her no\npeace; and at last she went to Janet and asked her to ring up Charlie\none day and ask him to come to dinner and make a fourth at bridge.\nCharlie would never go anywhere without his wife, but the Marshes were\nold friends, and Janet made a point of it. She invented some\ncock-and-bull story that made it seem important that he should consent.\nNext day Margery and she met. The evening had been wonderful. They had\ndined at Maidenhead and danced there and then had driven home through\nthe summer night.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He says he's crazy about me,\" Margery told her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did he kiss you?\" asked Janet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course,\" Margery chuckled. \"Don't be silly, Janet. He is awfully\nsweet and, you know, he has such a nice nature. Of course I don't\nbelieve half the things he says to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear, you're not going to fall in love with him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have,\" said Margery.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Darling, isn't it going to be rather awkward?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, it won't last. After all he's going back to Borneo in the autumn.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, one can't deny that it's made you look years younger.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know, and I feel years younger.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSoon they were meeting every day. They met in the morning and walked in\nthe Park together or went to a picture gallery. They separated for\nMargery to lunch with her husband and after lunch met again and motored\ninto the country or to some place on the river. Margery did not tell her\nhusband. She very naturally thought he would not understand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How was it you never met Morton?\" I asked Janet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, she didn't want me to. You see, we belong to the same generation,\nMargery and I. I quite understand that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I did everything I could. When she went out with Gerry she\nwas always supposed to be with me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am a person who likes to cross a \"t\" and dot an \"i\".\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Were they having an affair?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, no. Margery isn't that sort of woman at all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How do you know?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She would have told me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose she would.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I asked her. But she denied it point-blank and I'm sure she\nwas telling me the truth. There's never been anything of that sort\nbetween them at all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It seems rather odd to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you see, Margery is a very good woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI shrugged my shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was absolutely loyal to Charlie. She wouldn't have deceived him for\nanything in the world. She couldn't bear the thought of having any\nsecret from him. As soon as she knew she was in love with Gerry she\nwanted to tell Charlie. Of course I begged her not to. I told her it\nwouldn't do any good and it would only make Charlie miserable. And after\nall, the boy was going away in a couple of months, it didn't seem much\ngood to make a lot of fuss about a thing that couldn't possibly last.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Gerry's imminent departure was the cause of the crash. The Bishops\nhad arranged to go abroad as usual and proposed to motor through\nBelgium, Holland and the North of Germany. Charlie was busy with maps\nand guides. He collected information from friends about hotels and\nroads. He looked forward to his holiday with the bubbling excitement of\na schoolboy. Margery listened to him discussing it with a sinking heart.\nThey were to be away four weeks and in September Gerry was sailing. She\ncould not bear to lose so much of the short time that remained to them\nand the thought of the motor tour filled her with exasperation. As the\ninterval grew shorter and shorter she grew more and more nervous. At\nlast she decided that there was only one thing to do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Charlie, I don't want to come on this trip,\" she interrupted him\nsuddenly, one day when he was talking to her of some restaurant he had\njust heard of. \"I wish you'd get someone else to go with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at her blankly. She was startled at what she had said and her\nlips trembled a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, what's the matter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing's the matter. I don't feel like it. I want to be by myself for\na bit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you ill?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe saw the sudden fear in his eyes. His concern drove her beyond her\nendurance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. I've never been better in my life. I'm in love.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You? Whom with?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gerry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at her in amazement. He could not believe his ears. She\nmistook his expression.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's no good blaming me. I can't help it. He's going away in a few\nweeks. I'm not going to waste the little time he has left.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe burst out laughing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Margery, how can you make such a damned fool of yourself? You're old\nenough to be his mother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe flushed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's just as much in love with me as I am with him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Has he told you so?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A thousand times.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's a bloody liar, that's all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe chuckled. His fat stomach rippled with mirth. He thought it a huge\njoke. I daresay Charlie did not treat his wife in the proper way. Janet\nseemed to think he should have been tender and compassionate. <i>He should\nhave understood.</i> I saw the scene that was in her mind's eye, the stiff\nupper lip, the silent sorrow, and the final renunciation. Women are\nalways sensitive to the beauty of the self-sacrifice of others. Janet\nwould have sympathised also if he had flown into a violent passion,\nbroken one or two pieces of furniture (which he would have had to\nreplace), or given Margery a sock in the jaw. But to laugh at her was\nunpardonable. I did not point out that it is very difficult for a rather\nstout and not very tall professor of pathology, aged fifty-five, to act\nall of a sudden like a cave-man. Anyhow, the excursion to Holland was\ngiven up and the Bishops stayed in London through August. They were not\nvery happy. They lunched and dined together every day because they had\nbeen in the habit of doing so for so many years and the rest of the time\nMargery spent with Gerry. The hours she passed with him made up for all\nshe had to put up with and she had to put up with a good deal. Charlie\nhad a ribald and sarcastic humour and he made himself very funny at her\nexpense and at Gerry's. He persisted in refusing to take the matter\nseriously. He was vexed with Margery for being so silly, but apparently\nit never occurred to him that she might have been unfaithful to him. I\ncommented upon this to Janet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He never suspected it even,\" she said. \"He knew Margery much too well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe weeks passed and at last Gerry sailed. He went from Tilbury and\nMargery saw him off. When she came back she cried for forty-eight hours.\nCharlie watched her with increasing exasperation. His nerves were much\nfrayed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, Margery,\" he said at last, \"I've been very patient with you,\nbut now you must pull yourself together. This is getting past a joke.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why can't you leave me alone?\" she cried. \"I've lost everything that\nmade life lovely to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be such a fool,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI do not know what else he said. But he was unwise enough to tell her\nwhat he thought of Gerry and I gather that the picture he drew was\nvirulent. It started the first violent scene they had ever had. She had\nborne Charlie's jibes when she knew that she would see Gerry in an hour\nor next day, but now that she had lost him for ever she could bear them\nno longer. She had held herself in for weeks: now she flung her\nself-control to the winds. Perhaps she never knew exactly what she said\nto Charlie. He had always been irascible and at last he hit her. They\nwere both frightened when he had. He seized a hat and flung out of the\nflat. During all that miserable time they had shared the same bed, but\nwhen he came back, in the middle of the night, he found that she had\nmade herself up a shake-down on the sofa in the sitting-room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't sleep there,\" he said. \"Don't be so silly. Come to bed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I won't, let me alone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor the rest of the night they wrangled, but she had her way and now\nmade up her bed every night on the sofa. But in that tiny flat they\ncould not get away from one another; they could not even get out of\nsight or out of hearing of one another. They had lived in such intimacy\nfor so many years that it was an instinct for them to be together. He\ntried to reason with her. He thought her incredibly stupid and argued\nwith her interminably in the effort to show her how wrong-headed she\nwas. He could not leave her alone. He would not let her sleep, and he\ntalked half through the night till they were both exhausted. He thought\nhe could talk her out of love. For two or three days at a time they\nwould not speak to one another. Then one day, coming home, he found her\ncrying bitterly; the sight of her tears distracted him; he told her how\nmuch he loved her and sought to move her by the recollection of all the\nhappy years they had spent together. He wanted to let bygones be\nbygones. He promised never to refer to Gerry again. Could they not\nforget the nightmare they had been through? But the thought of all that\na reconciliation implied revolted her. She told him she had a racking\nheadache and asked him to give her a sleeping draught. She pretended to\nbe still asleep when he went out next morning, but the moment he was\ngone she packed up her things and left. She had a few trinkets that she\nhad inherited and by selling them she got a little money. She took a\nroom at a cheap boarding-house and kept her address a secret from\nCharlie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was when he found she had left him that he went all to pieces. The\nshock of her flight broke him. He told Janet that his loneliness was\nintolerable. He wrote to Margery imploring her to come back, and asked\nJanet to intercede for him; he was willing to promise anything; he\nabased himself. Margery was obdurate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think she'll ever go back?\" I asked Janet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She says not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had to leave then, for it was nearly half-past one and I was bound for\nthe other end of London.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTwo or three days later I got a telephone message from Margery asking if\nI could see her. She suggested coming to my rooms. I asked her to tea. I\ntried to be nice to her; her affairs were no business of mine, but in my\nheart I thought her a very silly woman and I dare say my manner was\ncold. She had never been handsome and the passing years had changed her\nlittle. She had still those fine dark eyes and her face was\nastonishingly unlined. She was very simply dressed and if she wore\nmake-up it was so cunningly put on that I did not perceive it. She had\nstill the charm she had always had of perfect naturalness and of a\nkindly humour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want you to do something for me if you will,\" she began without\nbeating about the bush.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Charlie is leaving the Marshes to-day and going back to the flat. I'm\nafraid his first few days there will be rather difficult; it would be\nawfully nice of you if you'd ask him to dinner or something.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll have a look at my book.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm told he's been drinking heavily. It's such a pity. I wish you could\ngive him a hint.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I understand he's had some domestic worries of late,\" I said, perhaps\nacidly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMargery flushed. She gave me a pained look. She winced as though I had\nstruck her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course you've known him ever so much longer than you've known me.\nIt's natural that you should take his part.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear, to tell you the truth I've known him all these years chiefly\non your account. I have never very much liked him, but I thought you\nwere awfully nice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe smiled at me and her smile was very sweet. She knew that I meant\nwhat I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think I was a good wife to him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perfect.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He used to put people's backs up. A lot of people didn't like him, but\nI never found him difficult.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was awfully fond of you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know. We had a wonderful time together. For sixteen years we were\nperfectly happy.\" She paused and looked down. \"I had to leave him. It\nbecame quite impossible. That cat-and-dog life we were leading was too\nawful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never see why two persons should go on living together if they don't\nwant to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see, it was awful for us. We'd always lived in such close intimacy.\nWe could never get away from one another. At the end I hated the sight\nof him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't suppose the situation was easy for either of you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It wasn't my fault that I fell in love. You see, it was quite a\ndifferent love from the one I'd felt for Charlie. There was always\nsomething maternal in that and protective. I was so much more reasonable\nthan he was. He was unmanageable, but I could always manage him. Gerry\nwas different.\" Her voice grew soft and her face was transfigured with\nglory. \"He gave me back my youth. I was a girl to him and I could depend\non his strength and be safe in his care.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He seemed to me a very nice lad,\" I said slowly. \"I imagine he'll do\nwell. He was very young for the job he had when I ran across him. He's\nonly twenty-nine now, isn't he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe smiled softly. She knew quite well what I meant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never made any secret of my age to him. He says it doesn't matter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI knew this was true. She was not the woman to have lied about her age.\nShe had found a sort of fierce delight in telling him the truth about\nherself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How old are you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Forty-four.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do now?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've written to Gerry and told him I've left Charlie. As soon as I hear\nfrom him I'm going out to join him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was staggered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, it's a very primitive little colony he's living in. I'm\nafraid you'll find your position rather awkward.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He made me promise that if I found my life impossible after he left I'd\ngo to him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you sure you're wise to attach so much importance to the things a\nyoung man says when he's in love?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAgain that really beautiful look of exaltation came into her face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, when the young man happens to be Gerry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy heart sank. I was silent for a moment. Then I told her the story of\nthe road Gerry Morton had built. I dramatised it, and I think I made it\nrather effective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did you tell me that for?\" she asked when I finished.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought it rather a good story.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shook her head and smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, you wanted to show me that he was very young and enthusiastic, and\nso keen on his work that he hadn't much time to waste on other\ninterests. I wouldn't interfere with his work. You don't know him as I\ndo. He's incredibly romantic. He looks upon himself as a pioneer. I've\ncaught from him something of his excitement at the idea of taking part\nin the opening up of a new country. It is rather splendid, isn't it? It\nmakes life here seem very humdrum and commonplace. But of course it's\nvery lonely there. Even the companionship of a middle-aged woman may be\nworth having.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you proposing to marry him?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I leave myself in his hands. I want to do nothing that he does not\nwish.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe spoke with so much simplicity, there was something so touching in\nher self-surrender, that when she left me I no longer felt angry with\nher. Of course I thought her very foolish, but if the folly of men made\none angry one would pass one's life in a state of chronic ire. I thought\nall would come right. She said Gerry was romantic. He was, but the\nromantics in this workaday world only get away with their nonsense\nbecause they have at bottom a shrewd sense of reality: the mugs are the\npeople who take their vapourings at their face value. The English are\nromantic; that is why other nations think them hypocritical; they are\nnot: they set out in all sincerity for the Kingdom of God, but the\njourney is arduous and they have reason to pick up any gilt-edged\ninvestment that offers itself by the way. The British soul, like\nWellington's armies, marches on its belly. I supposed that Gerry would\ngo through a bad quarter of an hour when he received Margery's letter.\nMy sympathies were not deeply engaged in the matter and I was only\ncurious to see how he would extricate himself from the pass he was in. I\nthought Margery would suffer a bitter disappointment; well, that would\ndo her no great harm, and then she would go back to her husband and I\nhad no doubt the pair of them, chastened, would live in peace, quiet and\nhappiness for the rest of their lives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe event was different. It happened that it was quite impossible for me\nto make any sort of engagement with Charlie Bishop for some days, but I\nwrote to him and asked him to dine with me one evening in the following\nweek. I proposed, though with misgiving, that we should go to a play; I\nknew he was drinking like a fish, and when tight he was noisy. I hoped\nhe would not make a nuisance of himself in the theatre. We arranged to\nmeet at our club and dine at seven because the piece we were going to\nbegan at a quarter past eight. I arrived. I waited. He did not come. I\nrang up his flat, but could get no reply, so concluded that he was on\nhis way. I hate missing the beginning of a play and I waited impatiently\nin the hall so that when he came we could go straight upstairs. To save\ntime I had ordered dinner. The clock pointed to half-past seven, then a\nquarter to eight; I did not see why I should wait for him any longer, so\nwalked up to the dining-room and ate my dinner alone. He did not appear.\nI put a call through from the dining-room to the Marshes and presently\nwas told by a waiter that Bill Marsh was at the end of the wire.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, do you know anything about Charlie Bishop?\" I said. \"We were\ndining together and going to a play and he hasn't turned up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He died this afternoon?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy exclamation was so startled that two or three people within earshot\nlooked up. The dining-room was full and the waiters were hurrying to and\nfro. The telephone was on the cashier's desk and a wine waiter came up\nwith a bottle of hock and two long-stemmed glasses on a tray and gave\nthe cashier a chit. The portly steward showing two men to a table\njostled me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where are you speaking from?\" asked Bill.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI suppose he heard the clatter that surrounded me. When I told him he\nasked me if I could come round as soon as I had finished my dinner.\nJanet wanted to speak to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll come at once,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI found Janet and Bill sitting in the drawing-room. He was reading the\npaper and she was playing patience. She came forward swiftly when the\nmaid showed me in. She walked with a sort of spring, crouching a little,\non silent feet, like a panther stalking his prey. I saw at once that she\nwas in her element. She gave me her hand and turned her face away to\nhide her eyes brimming with tears. Her voice was low and tragic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I brought Margery here and put her to bed. The doctor has given her a\nsedative. She's all in. Isn't it awful?\" She gave a sound that was\nsomething between a gasp and a sob. \"I don't know why these things\nalways happen to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Bishops had never kept a servant but a charwoman went in every\nmorning, cleaned the flat and washed up the breakfast things. She had\nher own key. That morning she had gone in as usual and done the\nsitting-room. Since his wife had left him Charlie's hours had been\nirregular and she was not surprised to find him asleep. But the time\npassed and she knew he had his work to go to. She went to the\nbedroom-door and knocked. There was no answer. She thought she heard him\ngroaning. She opened the door softly. He was lying in bed, on his back,\nand was breathing stertorously. He did not wake. She called him.\nSomething about him frightened her. She went to the flat on the same\nlanding. It was occupied by a journalist. He was still in bed when she\nrang, and opened the door to her in pyjamas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" she said, \"but would you just come and 'ave a look at\nmy gentleman. I don't think he's well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe journalist walked across the landing and into Charlie's flat. There\nwas an empty bottle of veronal by the bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think you'd better fetch a policeman,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA policeman came and rang through to the police-station for an\nambulance. They took Charlie to Charing Cross Hospital. He never\nrecovered consciousness. Margery was with him at the end.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course there'll have to be an inquest,\" said Janet. \"But it's quite\nobvious what happened. He'd been sleeping awfully badly for the last\nthree or four weeks and I suppose he'd been taking veronal. He must have\ntaken an overdose by accident.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is that what Margery thinks?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's too upset to think anything, but I told her I was positive he\nhadn't committed suicide. I mean, he wasn't that sort of a man. Am I\nright, Bill?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, dear,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did he leave any letter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, nothing. Oddly enough Margery got a letter from him this morning,\nwell, hardly a letter, just a line. 'I'm so lonely without you,\ndarling.' That's all. But of course that means nothing and she's\npromised to say nothing about it at the inquest. I mean, what is the use\nof putting ideas in people's heads? Everyone knows that you never can\ntell with veronal, I wouldn't take it myself for anything in the world,\nand it was quite obviously an accident. Am I right, Bill?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, dear,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI saw that Janet was quite determined to believe that Charlie Bishop had\nnot committed suicide, but how far in her heart she believed what she\nwanted to believe I was not sufficiently expert in female psychology to\nknow. And of course it might be that she was right. It is unreasonable\nto suppose that a middle-aged scientist should kill himself because his\nmiddle-aged wife leaves him and it is extremely plausible that,\nexasperated by sleeplessness, and in all probability far from sober, he\ntook a larger dose of the sleeping-draught than he realised. Anyhow that\nwas the view the coroner took of the matter. It was indicated to him\nthat of late Charles Bishop had given way to habits of intemperance\nwhich had caused his wife to leave him, and it was quite obvious that\nnothing was further from his thoughts than to put an end to himself. The\ncoroner expressed his sympathy with the widow and commented very\nstrongly on the dangers of sleeping-draughts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI hate funerals, but Janet begged me to go to Charlie's. Several of his\ncolleagues at the hospital had intimated their desire to come, but at\nMargery's wish they were dissuaded; and Janet and Bill, Margery and I\nwere the only persons who attended it. We were to fetch the hearse from\nthe mortuary and they offered to call for me on their way. I was on the\nlook-out for the car and when I saw it drive up went downstairs, but\nBill got out and met me just inside the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Half a minute,\" he said. \"I've got something to say to you. Janet wants\nyou to come back afterwards and have tea. She says it's no good Margery\nmoping and after tea we'll play a few rubbers of bridge. Can you come?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Like this?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had a tail-coat on and a black tie and my evening dress trousers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, that's all right. It'll take Margery's mind off.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut we did not play bridge after all. Janet, with her fair hair, was\nvery smart in her deep mourning and she played the part of the\nsympathetic friend with amazing skill. She cried a little, wiping her\neyes delicately so as not to disturb the black on her eyelashes, and\nwhen Margery sobbed broken-heartedly put her arm tenderly through hers.\nShe was a very present help in trouble. We returned to the house. There\nwas a telegram for Margery. She took it and went upstairs. I presumed it\nwas a message of condolence from one of Charlie's friends who had just\nheard of his death. Bill went to change and Janet and I went up to the\ndrawing-room and got the bridge table out. She took off her hat and put\nit on the piano.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's no good being hypocritical,\" she said. \"Of course Margery has been\nfrightfully upset, but she must pull herself together now. A rubber of\nbridge will help her to get back to her normal state. Naturally I'm\ndreadfully sorry about poor Charlie, but as far as he was concerned I\ndon't believe he'd ever have got over Margery's leaving him and one\ncan't deny that it has made things much easier for her. She wired to\nGerry this morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What about?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To tell him about poor Charlie.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment the maid came to the room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you go up to Mrs. Bishop, please, ma'am? She wants to see you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, of course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe went out of the room quickly and I was left alone. Bill joined me\npresently and we had a drink. At last Janet came back. She handed a\ntelegram to me. It read as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <i>For God's sake await letter.  Gerry.</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you think it means?\" she asked me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What it says,\" I replied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Idiot! Of course I've told Margery that it doesn't mean anything, but\nshe's rather worried. It must have crossed her cable telling him that\nCharles was dead. I don't think she feels very much like bridge after\nall. I mean, it would be rather bad form to play on the very day her\nhusband has been buried.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course he may wire in answer to the cable. He's sure to do that,\nisn't he? The only thing we can do now is to sit tight and wait for his\nletter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI saw no object in continuing the conversation. I left. In a couple of\ndays Janet rang me up to tell me that Margery had received a telegram of\ncondolence from Morton. She repeated it to me.\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <i>Dreadfully distressed to hear sad news. Deeply sympathise with\n    your great grief.  Love.  Gerry.</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you think of it?\" she asked me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think it's very proper.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course he couldn't say he was as pleased as Punch, could he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not with any delicacy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And he did put in <i>love</i>.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI imagined how those women had examined the two telegrams from every\npoint of view and scrutinised every word to press from it every possible\nshade of meaning. I almost heard their interminable conversations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what'll happen to Margery if he lets her down now,\" Janet\nwent on. \"Of course it remains to be seen if he's a gentleman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Rot,\" I said and rang off quickly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the course of the following days I dined with the Marshes a couple of\ntimes. Margery looked tired. I guessed that she awaited the letter that\nwas on the way with sickening anxiety. Grief and fear had worn her to a\nshadow, she seemed very fragile now and she had acquired a spiritual\nlook that I had never seen in her before. She was very gentle, very\ngrateful for every kindness shown her, and in her smile, unsure and a\nlittle timid, was an infinite pathos. Her helplessness was very\nappealing. But Morton was several thousand miles away. Then one morning\nJanet rang me up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The letter has come. Margery says I can show it to you. Will you come\nround?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer tense voice told me everything. When I arrived Janet gave it to me.\nI read it. It was a very careful letter and I guessed that Morton had\nwritten it a good many times. It was very kind and he had evidently\ntaken great pains to avoid saying anything that could possibly wound\nMargery; but what transpired was his terror. It was obvious that he was\nshaking in his shoes. He had felt apparently that the best way to cope\nwith the situation was to be mildly facetious and he made very good fun\nof the white people in the colony. What would they say if Margery\nsuddenly turned up? He would be given the order of the boot pretty damn\nquick. People thought the East was free and easy; it wasn't, it was more\nsuburban than Clapham. He loved Margery far too much to bear the\nthoughts of those horrible women out there turning up their noses at\nher. And besides he had been sent to a station ten days from anywhere;\nshe couldn't live in his bungalow exactly and of course there wasn't a\nhotel, and his work took him out into the jungle for days at a time. It\nwas no place for a woman anyhow. He told her how much she meant to him,\nbut she mustn't bother about him and he couldn't help thinking it would\nbe better if she went back to her husband. He would never forgive\nhimself if he thought he had come between her and Charlie. Yes, I am\nquite sure it had been a difficult letter to write.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course he didn't know then that Charlie was dead. I've told Margery\nthat changes everything.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does she agree with you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think she's being rather unreasonable. What do you make of the\nletter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it's quite plain that he doesn't want her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He wanted her badly enough two months ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's astonishing what a change of air and a change of scene will do for\nyou. It must seem to him already like a year since he left London. He's\nback among his old friends and his old interests. My dear, it's no good\nMargery kidding herself; the life there has taken him back and there's\nno place for her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've advised her to ignore the letter and go straight out to him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope she's too sensible to expose herself to a very terrible rebuff.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But then what's to happen to her? Oh, it's too cruel. She's the best\nwoman in the world. She has real goodness.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's funny if you come to think of it, it's her goodness that has\ncaused all the trouble. Why on earth didn't she have an affair with\nMorton? Charlie would have known nothing about it and wouldn't have been\na penny the worse. She and Morton could have had a grand time and when\nhe went away they could have parted with the consciousness that a\npleasant episode had come to a graceful end. It would have been a jolly\nrecollection, and she could have gone back to Charlie satisfied and\nrested and continued to make him the excellent wife she had always\nbeen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJanet pursed her lips. She gave me a look of disdain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is such a thing as virtue, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Virtue be damned. A virtue that only causes havoc and unhappiness is\nworth nothing. You can call it virtue if you like. I call it cowardice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The thought of being unfaithful to Charlie while she was living with\nhim revolted her. There are women like that, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good gracious, she could have remained faithful to him in spirit while\nshe was being unfaithful to him in the flesh. That is a feat of\nlegerdemain that women find it easy to accomplish.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What an odious cynic you are.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If it's cynical to look truth in the face and exercise common-sense in\nthe affairs of life, then certainly I'm a cynic and odious if you like.\nLet's face it, Margery's a middle-aged woman, Charlie was fifty-five and\nthey'd been married for sixteen years. It was natural enough that she\nshould lose her head over a young man who made a fuss of her. But don't\ncall it love. It was physiology. She was a fool to take anything he said\nseriously. It wasn't himself speaking, it was his starved sex, he'd\nsuffered from sexual starvation, at least as far as white women are\nconcerned, for four years; it's monstrous that she should seek to ruin\nhis life by holding him to the wild promises he made then. It was an\naccident that Margery took his fancy; he wanted her, and because he\ncouldn't get her wanted her more. I dare say he thought it love; believe\nme, it was only letch. If they'd gone to bed together Charlie would be\nalive to-day. It's her damned virtue that caused the whole trouble.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How stupid you are. Don't you see that she couldn't help herself? She\njust doesn't happen to be a loose woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I prefer a loose woman to a selfish one and a wanton to a fool.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, shut up. I didn't ask you to come here in order to make yourself\nabsolutely beastly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did you ask me to come here for?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gerry is your friend. You introduced him to Margery. If she's in the\nsoup it's on his account. But <i>you</i> are the cause of the whole trouble.\nIt's your duty to write to him and tell him he must do the right thing\nby her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm damned if I will,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then you'd better go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI started to do so.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, at all events it's a mercy that Charlie's life was insured,\" said\nJanet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen I turned on her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And you have the nerve to call me a cynic.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI will not repeat the opprobrious word I flung at her as I slammed the\ndoor behind me. But Janet is all the same a very nice woman. I often\nthink it would be great fun to be married to her.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nIt was on account of the scar that I first noticed him, for it ran,\nbroad and red, in a great crescent from his temple to his chin. It must\nhave been due to a formidable wound and I wondered whether this had been\ncaused by a sabre or by a fragment of shell. It was unexpected on that\nround, fat and good-humoured face. He had small and undistinguished\nfeatures, and his expression was artless. His face went oddly with his\ncorpulent body. He was a powerful man of more than common height. I\nnever saw him in anything but a very shabby grey suit, a khaki shirt and\na battered sombrero. He was far from clean. He used to come into the\nPalace Hotel at Guatemala City every day at cocktail time and strolling\nleisurely round the bar offer lottery tickets for sale. If this was the\nway he made his living it must have been a poor one for I never saw\nanyone buy, but now and then I saw him offered a drink. He never refused\nit. He threaded his way among the tables with a sort of rolling walk as\nthough he were accustomed to traverse long distances on foot, paused at\neach table, with a little smile mentioned the numbers he had for sale\nand then, when no notice was taken of him, with the same smile passed\non. I think he was for the most part a trifle the worse for liquor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was standing at the bar one evening, my foot on the rail, with an\nacquaintance--they make a very good dry Martini at the Palace Hotel in\nGuatemala City--when the man with the scar came up. I shook my head as\nfor the twentieth time since my arrival he held out for my inspection\nhis lottery tickets. But my companion nodded affably.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Qué tal, general?</i> How is life?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not so bad. Business is none too good, but it might be worse.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What will you have, general?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A brandy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe tossed it down and put the glass back on the bar. He nodded to my\nacquaintance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Gracias. Hasta luego.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he turned away and offered his tickets to the men who were standing\nnext to us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is your friend?\" I asked. \"That's a terrific scar on his face.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It doesn't add to his beauty, does it? He's an exile from Nicaragua.\nHe's a ruffian of course and a bandit, but not a bad fellow. I give him\na few <i>pesos</i> now and then. He was a revolutionary general, and if his\nammunition hadn't given out he'd have upset the government and be\nMinister of War now instead of selling lottery tickets in Guatemala.\nThey captured him, along with his staff, such as it was, and tried him\nby court-martial. Such things are rather summary in these countries, you\nknow, and he was sentenced to be shot at dawn. I guess he knew what was\ncoming to him when he was caught. He spent the night in gaol and he and\nthe others, there were five of them altogether, passed the time playing\npoker. They used matches for chips. He told me he'd never had such a run\nof bad luck in his life; they were playing with a short pack, Jacks to\nopen, but he never held a card; he never improved more than half a dozen\ntimes in the whole sitting and no sooner did he buy a new stack than he\nlost it. When day broke and the soldiers came into the cell to fetch\nthem for execution he had lost more matches than a reasonable man could\nuse in a lifetime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They were led into the patio of the gaol and placed against a wall, the\nfive of them side by side, with the firing party facing them. There was\na pause and our friend asked the officer in charge of them what the\ndevil they were keeping him waiting for. The officer said that the\ngeneral commanding the government troops wished to attend the execution\nand they awaited his arrival.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Then I have time to smoke another cigarette,' said our friend. 'He was\nalways unpunctual.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But he had barely lit it when the general--it was San Ignacio, by the\nway: I don't know whether you ever met him--followed by his A.D.C. came\ninto the patio. The usual formalities were performed and San Ignacio\nasked the condemned men whether there was anything they wished before\nthe execution took place. Four of the five shook their heads, but our\nfriend spoke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Yes, I should like to say good-bye to my wife.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'<i>Bueno</i>,' said the general, 'I have no objection to that. Where is\nshe?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'She is waiting at the prison door.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Then it will not cause a delay of more than five minutes.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Hardly that, <i>Señor General</i>,' said our friend.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Have him placed on one side.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Two soldiers advanced and between them the condemned rebel walked to\nthe spot indicated. The officer in command of the firing squad on a nod\nfrom the general gave an order, there was a ragged report, and the four\nmen fell. They fell strangely, not together, but one after the other,\nwith movements that were almost grotesque, as though they were puppets\nin a toy theatre. The officer went up to them and into one who was still\nalive emptied two barrels of his revolver. Our friend finished his\ncigarette and threw away the stub.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There was a little stir at the gateway. A woman came into the patio,\nwith quick steps, and then, her hand on her heart, stopped suddenly. She\ngave a cry and with outstretched arms ran forward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'<i>Caramba</i>,' said the General.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was in black, with a veil over her hair, and her face was dead\nwhite. She was hardly more than a girl, a slim creature, with little\nregular features and enormous eyes. But they were distraught with\nanguish. Her loveliness was such that as she ran, her mouth slightly\nopen and the agony of her face beautiful, a gasp of surprise was wrung\nfrom those indifferent soldiers who looked at her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The rebel advanced a step or two to meet her. She flung herself into\nhis arms and with a hoarse cry of passion: <i>alma de mi corazón</i>, soul of\nmy heart, he pressed his lips to hers. And at the same moment he drew a\nknife from his ragged shirt--I haven't a notion how he managed to retain\npossession of it--and stabbed her in the neck. The blood spurted from\nthe cut vein and dyed his shirt. Then he flung his arms round her and\nonce more pressed his lips to hers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It happened so quickly that many did not know what had occurred, but\nfrom the others burst a cry of horror; they sprang forward and seized\nhim. They loosened his grasp and the girl would have fallen if the\nA.D.C. had not caught her. She was unconscious. They laid her on the\nground and with dismay on their faces stood round watching her. The\nrebel knew where he was striking and it was impossible to staunch the\nblood. In a moment the A.D.C. who had been kneeling by her side rose.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'She's dead,' he whispered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The rebel crossed himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Why did you do it?\" asked the general.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I loved her.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A sort of sigh passed through those men crowded together and they\nlooked with strange faces at the murderer. The general stared at him for\na while in silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It was a noble gesture,' he said at last. 'I cannot execute this man.\nTake my car and have him led to the frontier. <i>Señor</i>, I offer you the\nhomage which is due from one brave man to another.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A murmur of approbation broke from those who listened. The A.D.C.\ntapped the rebel on the shoulder, and between the two soldiers without a\nword he marched to the waiting car.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy friend stopped and for a little I was silent. I must explain that he\nwas a Guatemalecan and spoke to me in Spanish. I have translated what he\ntold me as well as I could, but I have made no attempt to tone down his\nrather high-flown language. To tell the truth I think it suits the\nstory.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But how then did he get the scar?\" I asked at length.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, that was due to a bottle that burst when I was opening it. A bottle\nof ginger ale.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never liked it,\" said I.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nNothing would induce me to tell the name of the happy country in which\nthe incidents occurred that I am constrained to relate; but I see no\nharm in admitting that it is a free and independent state on the\ncontinent of America. This is vague enough in all conscience and can\ngive rise to no diplomatic incident. Now the president of this free and\nindependent state had an eye to a pretty woman and there came to his\ncapital, a wide and sunny town with a plaza, a cathedral that was not\nwithout dignity and a few old Spanish houses, a young person from\nMichigan of such a pleasing aspect that his heart went out to her. He\nlost no time in declaring his passion and was gratified to learn that it\nwas returned, but he was mortified to discover that the young person\nregarded his possession of a wife and her possession of a husband as a\nbar to their union. She had a feminine weakness for marriage. Though it\nseemed unreasonable to the president, he was not the man to refuse a\npretty woman the gratification of her whim and promised to make such\narrangements as would enable him to offer her wedlock. He called his\nattorneys together and put the matter before them. He had long thought,\nhe said, that for a progressive country their marriage laws were\nremarkably out of date and he proposed therefore radically to amend\nthem. The attorneys retired and after a brief interval devised a divorce\nlaw that was satisfactory to the president. But the state of which I\nwrite was always careful to do things in a constitutional way, for it\nwas a highly civilised, democratic and reputable country. A president\nwho respects himself and his oath of office cannot promulgate a law,\neven if it is to his own interest, without adhering to certain forms,\nand these things take time; the president had barely signed the decree\nthat made the new divorce law valid when a revolution broke out and he\nwas very unfortunately hanged on a lamp-post in the plaza in front of\nthe cathedral that was not without dignity. The young person of pleasing\naspect left town in a hurry, but the law remained. Its terms were\nsimple. On the payment of one hundred dollars gold and after a residence\nof thirty days a man could divorce his wife or a wife her husband\nwithout even apprising the other party of the intended step. Your wife\nmight tell you that she was going to spend a month with her aged mother\nand one morning at breakfast when you looked through your mail you might\nreceive a letter from her informing you that she had divorced you and\nwas already married to another.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow it was not long before the happy news spread here and there that at\na reasonable distance from New York was a country, the capital of which\nhad an equable climate and tolerable accommodation, where a woman could\nrelease herself, expeditiously and with economy, from the irksome bonds\nof matrimony. The fact that the operation could be performed without the\nhusband's knowledge saved her from those preliminary and acrimonious\ndiscussions that are so wearing to the nerves. Every woman knows that\nhowever much a man may argue about a proposition he will generally\naccept a fact with resignation. Tell him you want a Rolls-Royce and he\nwill say he can't afford it, but buy it and he will sign his cheque like\na lamb. So in a very short time beautiful women in considerable numbers\nbegan to come down to the pleasant, sunny town; tired business women and\nwomen of fashion, women of pleasure and women of leisure; they came from\nNew York, Chicago and San Francisco, they came from Georgia and they\ncame from Dakota, they came from all the states in the Union. The\npassenger accommodation on the ships of the United Fruit Line was only\njust adequate to the demand, and if you wanted a stateroom to yourself\nyou had to engage it six months in advance. Prosperity descended upon\nthe capital of this enterprising state and in a very little while there\nwas not a lawyer in it who did not own a Ford car. Don Agosto, the\nproprietor of the Grand Hotel, went to the expense of building several\nbathrooms, but he did not grudge it; he was making a fortune, and he\nnever passed the lamp-post on which the outgoing president had been\nhanged without giving it a jaunty wave of his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was a great man,\" he said. \"One day they will erect a statue to\nhim.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI have spoken as though it were only women who availed themselves of\nthis convenient and reasonable law, and this might indicate that in the\nUnited States it is they rather than men who desire release from the\nimpediment of Holy Matrimony. I have no reason to believe that this is\nso. Though it was women in great majority who travelled to this country\nto get a divorce, I ascribe this to the fact that it is always easy for\nthem to get away for six weeks (a week there, a week back and thirty\ndays to establish a domicile) but it is difficult for men to leave their\naffairs so long. It is true that they could go there during their summer\nholidays, but then the heat is somewhat oppressive; and besides, there\nare no golf links: it is reasonable enough to suppose that many a man\nwill hesitate to divorce his wife when he can only do it at the cost of\na month's golf. There were of course two or three males spending their\nthirty days at the Grand Hotel, but they were generally, for a reason\nthat is obscure, commercial travellers. I can but imagine that by the\nnature of their avocations they were able at one and the same time to\npursue freedom and profit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBe this as it may, the fact remains that the inmates of the Grand Hotel\nwere for the most part women, and very gay it was in the patio at\nluncheon and at dinner when they sat at little square tables under the\narches discussing their matrimonial troubles and drinking champagne. Don\nAgosto did a roaring trade with the generals and colonels (there were\nmore generals than colonels in the army of this state), the lawyers,\nbankers, merchants and the young sparks of the town who came to look at\nthese beautiful creatures. But the perfect is seldom realised in this\nworld. There is always something that is not quite right and women\nengaged in getting rid of their husbands are very properly in an\nagitated condition. It makes them at times hard to please. Now it must\nbe confessed that this delightful little city, notwithstanding its\nmanifold advantages, somewhat lacked places of amusement. There was but\none cinema and this showed films that had been wandering too long from\ntheir happy home in Hollywood. In the day-time you could have\nconsultations with your lawyer, polish your nails and do a little\nshopping, but the evenings were intolerable. There were many complaints\nthat thirty days was a long time and more than one impatient young thing\nasked her lawyer why they didn't put a little pep into their law and do\nthe whole job in eight and forty hours. Don Agosto, however, was a man\nof resource and presently he had an inspiration: he engaged a troupe of\nwandering Guatemaltecans who played the marimba. There is no music in\nthe world that sets the toes so irresistibly tingling and in a little\nwhile everyone in the patio began dancing. It is of course obvious that\ntwenty-five beautiful women cannot dance with three commercial\ntravellers, but there were all these generals and colonels and there\nwere all the young sparks of the town. They danced divinely and they had\ngreat liquid black eyes. The hours flew, the days tripped one upon the\nheels of the other so quickly that the month passed before you realised\nit, and more than one of Don Agosto's guests when she bade him farewell\nconfessed that she would willingly have stayed longer. Don Agosto was\nradiant. He liked to see people enjoy themselves. The marimba band was\nworth twice the money he paid for it, and it did his heart good to see\nhis ladies dance with the gallant officers and the young men of the\ntown. Since Don Agosto was thrifty he always turned off the electric\nlight on the stairs and in the passages at ten o'clock at night and the\ngallant officers and the young men of the town improved their English\nwonderfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEverything went as merrily as a marriage bell, if I may use a phrase\nthat, however hackneyed, in this connection is irresistible, till one\nday Madame Coralie came to the conclusion that she had had enough of it.\nFor one man's meat is another man's poison. She dressed herself and went\nto call on her friend Carmencita. After she had in a few voluble words\nstated the purpose of her visit, Carmencita called a maid and told her\nto run and fetch La Gorda. They had a matter of importance which they\nwished to discuss with her. La Gorda, a woman of ample proportions with\na heavy moustache, soon joined them and over a bottle of Malaga the\nthree of them held a momentous conversation. The result of it was that\nthey indited a letter to the president asking for an audience. The new\npresident was a hefty young man in the early thirties who, a few years\nbefore, had been a stevedore in the employment of an American firm, and\nhe had risen to his present exalted station by a natural eloquence and\nan effective use of his gun when he wanted to make a point or emphasise\na statement. When one of his secretaries placed the letter before him he\nlaughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do those three old faggots want with me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he was a good-natured fellow and accessible. He did not forget that\nhe had been elected by the people, as one of the people, to protect the\npeople. He had also during his early youth been employed for some months\nby Madame Coralie to run errands. He told his secretary that he would\nsee them at ten o'clock next morning. They went at the appointed hour to\nthe palace and were led up a noble stairway to the audience chamber; the\nofficial who conducted them knocked softly on the door; a barred judas\nwas opened and a suspicious eye appeared. The president had no intention\nof suffering the fate of his predecessor if he could help it and no\nmatter who his visitors were did not receive them without precaution.\nThe official gave the three ladies' names, the door was opened, but not\ntoo wide, and they slipped in. It was a handsome room and various\nsecretaries at little tables, in their shirt-sleeves and with a revolver\non each hip, were busy typing. One or two other young men, heavily\narmed, were lying on sofas reading the papers and smoking cigarettes.\nThe president, also in his shirt-sleeves, with a revolver in his belt,\nwas standing with his thumbs in the sleeve-holes of his waistcoat. He\nwas tall and stout, of a handsome and even dignified presence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Qué tal</i>?\" he cried, jovially, with a flash of his white teeth. \"What\nbrings you here, <i>señoras</i>?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How well you're looking, Don Manuel,\" said La Gorda. \"You are a fine\nfigure of a man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe shook hands with them, and his staff, ceasing their strenuous\nactivity, leaned back and cordially waved their hands to the three\nladies. They were old friends and the greetings, if a trifle sardonic,\nwere hearty. I must disclose the fact now (which I could without doubt\ndo in a manner so discreet that I might be misunderstood; but if you\nhave to say something you may just as well say it plainly as not) that\nthese three ladies were the Madams of the three principal brothels in\nthe capital of this free and independent state. La Gorda and Carmencita\nwere of Spanish origin and were very decently dressed in black, with\nblack silk shawls over their heads, but Madame Coralie was French and\nshe wore a toque. They were all of mature age and of modest demeanour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe president made them sit down, and offered them madeira and\ncigarettes, but they refused.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, thank you, Don Manuel,\" said Madame Coralie. \"It is on business\nthat we have come to see you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what can I do for you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLa Gorda and Carmencita looked at Madame Coralie and Madame Coralie\nlooked at La Gorda and Carmencita. They nodded and she saw that they\nexpected her to be their spokeswoman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Don Manuel, it is like this. We are three women who have worked\nhard for many years and not a breath of scandal has ever tarnished our\ngood names. There are not in all the Americas three more distinguished\nhouses than ours and they are a credit to this beautiful city. Why, only\nlast year I spent five hundred dollars to supply my <i>sala principal</i>\nwith plate-glass mirrors. We have always been respectable and we have\npaid our taxes with regularity. It is hard now that the fruits of our\nlabours should be snatched away from us. I do not hesitate to say that\nafter so many years of honest and conscientious attention to business it\nis unjust that we should have to submit to such treatment.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe president was astounded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But, Coralie, my dear, I do not know what you mean. Has anyone dared to\nclaim money from you that the law does not sanction or that I know\nnothing about?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave his secretaries a suspicious glance. They tried to look\ninnocent, but though they were, only succeeded in looking uneasy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is the law we complain of. Ruin stares us in the face.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ruin?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So long as this new divorce law is in existence we can do no business\nand we may just as well shut up our beautiful houses.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen Madame Coralie explained in a manner so frank that I prefer to\nparaphrase her speech that owing to this invasion of the town by\nbeautiful ladies from a foreign land the three elegant houses on which\nshe and her two friends paid rates and taxes were utterly deserted. The\nyoung men of fashion preferred to spend their evenings at the Grand\nHotel where they received for soft words entertainment which at the\nregular establishments they could only have got for hard cash.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You cannot blame them,\" said the president.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't,\" cried Madame Coralie. \"I blame the women. They have no right\nto come and take the bread out of our mouths. Don Manuel, you are one of\nthe people, you are not one of these aristocrats; what will the country\nsay if you allow us to be driven out of business by blacklegs? I ask you\nis it just, is it honest?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what can I do?\" said the president. \"I cannot lock them up in their\nrooms for thirty days. How am I to blame if these foreigners have no\nsense of decency?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's different for a poor girl,\" said La Gorda. \"She has her way to\nmake. But that these women do that sort of thing when they're not\nobliged to, no, that I shall never understand.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is a bad and wicked law,\" said Carmencita.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe president sprang to his feet and threw his arms akimbo.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are not going to ask me to abrogate a law that has brought peace\nand plenty to this country. I am of the people and I was elected by the\npeople, and the prosperity of my fatherland is very near my heart.\nDivorce is our staple industry and the law shall be repealed only over\nmy dead body.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, <i>Maria Santissima</i>, that it should come to this,\" said Carmencita.\n\"And me with two daughters in a convent in New Orleans. Ah, in this\nbusiness one often has unpleasantness, but I always consoled myself by\nthinking that my daughters would marry well, and when the time came for\nme to retire they would inherit my business. Do you think I can keep\nthem in a convent in New Orleans for nothing?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And who is going to keep my son at Harvard if I have to close my house,\nDon Manuel?\" asked La Gorda.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As for myself,\" said Madame Coralie, \"I do not care. I shall return to\nFrance. My dear mother is eighty-seven years of age and she cannot live\nvery much longer. It will be a comfort to her if I spend her last\nremaining years by her side. But it is the injustice of it that hurts.\nYou have spent many happy evenings in my house, Don Manuel, and I am\nwounded that you should let us be treated like this. Did you not tell me\nyourself that it was the proudest day of your life when you entered as\nan honoured guest the house in which you had once been employed as\nerrand boy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do not deny it. I stood champagne all round.\" Don Manuel walked up\nand down the large hall, shrugging his shoulders as he went, and now and\nthen, deep in thought, he gesticulated. \"I am of the people, elected by\nthe people,\" he cried, \"and the fact is, these women are blacklegs.\" He\nturned to his secretaries with a dramatic gesture. \"It is a stain on my\nadministration. It is against all my principles to allow unskilled\nforeign labour to take the bread out of the mouths of honest and\nindustrious people. These ladies are quite right to come to me and\nappeal for my protection. I will not allow the scandal to continue.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was of course a pointed and effective speech, but all who heard it\nknew that it left things exactly where they were. Madame Coralie\npowdered her nose and gave it, a commanding organ, a brief look in her\npocket mirror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I know what human nature is,\" she said, \"and I can well\nunderstand that time hangs heavily on the hands of these creatures.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We could build a golfcourse,\" hazarded one of the secretaries. \"It is\ntrue that this would only occupy them by day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If they want men why can't they bring them with them?\" said La Gorda.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Caramba!</i>\" cried the president, and with that stood on a sudden quite\nstill. \"There is the solution.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had not reached his exalted station without being a man of insight\nand resource. He beamed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We will amend the law. Men shall come in as before without let or\nhindrance, but women only accompanied by their husbands or with their\nwritten consent.\" He saw the look of consternation which his secretaries\ngave him, and he waved his hand. \"But the immigration authorities shall\nreceive instructions to interpret the word husband with the widest\nlatitude.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Maria Santissima</i>!\" cried Madame Coralie. \"If they come with a friend\nhe will take care that no one else interferes with them and our\ncustomers will return to the houses where for so long they have been so\nhospitably entertained. Don Manuel, you are a great man and one of these\ndays they will erect a statue to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt is often the simplest expedients that settle the most formidable\ndifficulties. The law was briefly amended according to the terms of Don\nManuel's suggestion and, whereas prosperity continued to pour its\nblessings on the wide and sunny capital of this free and independent\nstate, Madame Coralie was enabled profitably to pursue her useful\navocations, Carmencita's two daughters completed their expensive\neducation in the convent at New Orleans, and La Gorda's son successfully\ngraduated at Harvard.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nGod knows how often I had lamented that I had not half the time I needed\nto do half the things I wanted. I could not remember when last I had had\na moment to myself. I had often amused my fancy with the prospect of\njust one week's complete idleness. Most of us when not busy working are\nbusy playing; we ride, play tennis or golf, swim or gamble; but I saw\nmyself doing nothing at all. I would lounge through the morning, dawdle\nthrough the afternoon and loaf through the evening. My mind would be a\nslate and each passing hour a sponge that wiped out the scribblings\nwritten on it by the world of sense. Time, because it is so fleeting,\ntime, because it is beyond recall, is the most precious of human goods\nand to squander it is the most delicate form of dissipation in which man\ncan indulge. Cleopatra dissolved in wine a priceless pearl, but she gave\nit to Antony to drink; when you waste the brief golden hours you take\nthe beaker in which the gem is melted and dash its contents to the\nground. The gesture is grand and like all grand gestures absurd. That of\ncourse is its excuse. In the week I promised myself I should naturally\nread, for to the habitual reader reading is a drug of which he is the\nslave; deprive him of printed matter and he grows nervous, moody and\nrestless; then, like the alcoholic bereft of brandy who will drink\nshellac or methylated spirit, he will make do with the advertisements of\na paper five years old; he will make do with a telephone directory. But\nthe professional writer is seldom a disinterested reader. I wished my\nreading to be but another form of idleness. I made up my mind that if\never the happy day arrived when I could enjoy untroubled leisure I would\ncomplete an enterprise that had always tempted me, but which hitherto,\nlike an explorer making reconnaissances into an undiscovered country, I\nhad done little more than enter upon: I would read the entire works of\nNick Carter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut I had always fancied myself choosing my moment with surroundings to\nmy liking, not having it forced upon me; and when I was suddenly faced\nwith nothing to do and had to make the best of it (like a steamship\nacquaintance whom in the wide waste of the Pacific Ocean you have\ninvited to stay with you in London and who turns up without warning and\nwith all his luggage) I was not a little taken aback. I had come to Vera\nCruz from Mexico City to catch one of the Ward Company's white cool\nships to Yucatan; and found to my dismay that, a dock strike having been\ndeclared over-night, my ship would not put in. I was stuck in Vera Cruz.\nI took a room in the Hotel Diligencias overlooking the plaza, and spent\nthe morning looking at the sights of the town. I wandered down side\nstreets and peeped into quaint courts. I sauntered through the parish\nchurch; it is picturesque with its gargoyles and flying buttresses, and\nthe salt wind and the blazing sun have patined its harsh and massive\nwalls with the mellowness of age; its cupola is covered with white and\nblue tiles. Then I found that I had seen all that was to be seen and I\nsat down in the coolness of the arcade that surrounded the square and\nordered a drink. The sun beat down on the plaza with a merciless\nsplendour. The coco-palms drooped dusty and bedraggled. Great black\nbuzzards perched on them for a moment uneasily, swooped to the ground to\ngather some bit of offal, and then with lumbering wings flew up to the\nchurch tower. I watched the people crossing the square; negroes,\nIndians, Creoles and Spanish, the motley people of the Spanish Main; and\nthey varied in colour from ebony to ivory. As the morning wore on, the\ntables around me filled up, chiefly with men, who had come to have a\ndrink before luncheon, for the most part in white ducks, but some\nnotwithstanding the heat in the dark clothes of professional\nrespectability. A small band, a guitarist, a blind fiddler and a\nharpist, played rag-time and after every other tune the guitarist came\nround with a plate. I had already bought the local paper and I was\nadamant to the newsvendors who pertinaciously sought to sell me more\ncopies of the same sheet. I refused, oh, twenty times at least, the\nsolicitations of grimy urchins who wanted to shine my spotless shoes;\nand having come to the end of my small change I could only shake my head\nat the beggars who importuned me. They gave one no peace. Little Indian\nwomen, in shapeless rags, each one with a baby tied in the shawl on her\nback, held out skinny hands and in a whimper recited a dismal screed;\nblind men were led up to my table by small boys; the maimed, the halt,\nthe deformed exhibited the sores and the monstrosities with which nature\nor accident had afflicted them; and half naked, underfed children whined\nendlessly their demand for coppers. But these kept their eyes open for\nthe fat policeman who would suddenly dart out on them with a thong and\ngive them a sharp cut on the back or over the head. Then they would\nscamper, only to return again when, exhausted by the exercise of so much\nenergy, he relapsed into lethargy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut suddenly my attention was attracted by a beggar who, unlike the rest\nof them and indeed the people sitting round me, swarthy and\nblack-haired, had hair and beard of a red so vivid that it was\nstartling. His beard was ragged and his long mop of hair looked as\nthough it had not been brushed for months. He wore only a pair of\ntrousers and a cotton singlet, but they were tatters, grimy and foul,\nthat barely held together. I have never seen anyone so thin; his legs,\nhis naked arms were but skin and bone and through the rents of his\nsinglet you saw every rib of his wasted body; you could count the bones\nof his dust-covered feet. Of that starveling band he was easily the most\nabject. He was not old, he could not well have been more than forty, and\nI could not but ask myself what had brought him to this pass. It was\nabsurd to think that he would not have worked if work he had been able\nto get. He was the only one of the beggars who did not speak. The rest\nof them poured forth their litany of woe and if it did not bring the\nalms they asked continued until an impatient word from you chased them\naway. He said nothing. I suppose he felt that his look of destitution\nwas all the appeal he needed. He did not even hold out his hand, he\nmerely looked at you, but with such wretchedness in his eyes, such\ndespair in his attitude, it was dreadful; he stood on and on, silent and\nimmobile, gazing steadfastly, and then, if you took no notice of him, he\nmoved slowly to the next table. If he was given nothing he showed\nneither disappointment nor anger. If someone offered him a coin he\nstepped forward a little, stretched out his claw-like hand, took it\nwithout a word of thanks and impassively went his way. I had nothing to\ngive him and when he came to me, so that he should not wait in vain, I\nshook my head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Dispense Usted por Dios</i>,\" I said, using the polite Castillian formula\nwith which the Spaniards refuse a beggar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he paid no attention to what I said. He stood in front of me, for as\nlong as he stood at the other tables, looking at me with tragic eyes. I\nhave never seen such a wreck of humanity. There was something terrifying\nin his appearance. He did not look quite sane. At length he passed on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was one o'clock and I had lunch. When I awoke from my siesta it was\nstill very hot, but towards evening a breath of air coming in through\nthe windows which I had at last ventured to open tempted me into the\nplaza. I sat down under my arcade and ordered a long drink. Presently\npeople in greater numbers filtered into the open space from the\nsurrounding streets, the tables in the restaurants round it filled up,\nand in the kiosk in the middle the band began to play. The crowd grew\nthicker. On the free benches people sat huddled together like dark\ngrapes clustered on a stalk. There was a lively hum of conversation. The\nbig black buzzards flew screeching overhead, swooping down when they saw\nsomething to pick up, or scurrying away from under the feet of the\npassers-by. As twilight descended they swarmed, it seemed from all parts\nof the town, towards the church tower; they circled heavily about it and\nhoarsely crying, squabbling and jangling, settled themselves uneasily to\nroost. And again bootblacks begged me to have my shoes cleaned, newsboys\npressed dank papers upon me, beggars whined their plaintive demand for\nalms. I saw once more that strange, red-bearded fellow and watched him\nstand motionless, with the crushed and piteous air, before one table\nafter another. He did not stop before mine. I supposed he remembered me\nfrom the morning and having failed to get anything from me then thought\nit useless to try again. You do not often see a red-haired Mexican, and\nbecause it was only in Russia that I had seen men of so destitute a mien\nI asked myself if he was by chance a Russian. It accorded well enough\nwith the Russian fecklessness that he should have allowed himself to\nsink to such a depth of degradation. Yet he had not a Russian face; his\nemaciated features were clear-cut, and his blue eyes were not set in the\nhead in a Russian manner; I wondered if he could be a sailor, English,\nScandinavian or American, who had deserted his ship and by degrees sunk\nto this pitiful condition. He disappeared. Since there was nothing else\nto do, I stayed on till I got hungry, and when I had eaten came back. I\nsat on till the thinning crowd suggested it was bed-time. I confess that\nthe day had seemed long and I wondered how many similar days I should be\nforced to spend there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut I woke after a little while and could not get to sleep again. My\nroom was stifling. I opened the shutters and looked out at the church.\nThere was no moon, but the bright stars faintly lit its outline. The\nbuzzards were closely packed on the cross above the cupola and on the\nedges of the tower, and now and then they moved a little. The effect was\nuncanny. And then, I have no notion why, that red scarecrow recurred to\nmy mind and I had suddenly a strange feeling that I had seen him before.\nIt was so vivid that it drove away from me the possibility of sleep. I\nfelt sure that I had come across him, but when and where I could not\ntell. I tried to picture the surroundings in which he might take his\nplace, but I could see no more than a dim figure against a background of\nfog. As the dawn approached it grew a little cooler and I was able to\nsleep.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI spent my second day at Vera Cruz as I had spent the first. But I\nwatched for the coming of the red-haired beggar, and as he stood at the\ntables near mine I examined him with attention. I felt certain now that\nI had seen him somewhere. I even felt certain that I had known him and\ntalked to him, but I still could recall none of the circumstances. Once\nmore he passed my table without stopping and when his eyes met mine I\nlooked in them for some gleam of recollection. Nothing. I wondered if I\nhad made a mistake and thought I had seen him in the same way as\nsometimes, by some queer motion of the brain, in the act of doing\nsomething you are convinced that you are repeating an action that you\nhave done at some past time. I could not get out of my head the\nimpression that at some moment he had entered into my life. I racked my\nbrains. I was sure now that he was either English or American. But I was\nshy of addressing him. I went over in my mind the possible occasions\nwhen I might have met him. Not to be able to place him exasperated me as\nit does when you try to remember a name that is on the tip of your\ntongue and yet eludes you. The day wore on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnother day came, another morning, another evening. It was Sunday and\nthe plaza was more crowded than ever. The tables under the arcade were\npacked. As usual the red-haired beggar came along, a terrifying figure\nin his silence, his threadbare rags and his pitiful distress. He was\nstanding in front of a table only two from mine, mutely beseeching, but\nwithout a gesture. Then I saw the policeman who at intervals tried to\nprotect the public from the importunities of all these beggars sneak\nround a column and give him a resounding whack with his thong. His thin\nbody winced, but he made no protest and showed no resentment; he seemed\nto accept the stinging blow as in the ordinary course of things and with\nhis slow movements slunk away into the gathering night of the plaza. But\nthe cruel stripe had whipped my memory and suddenly I remembered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNot his name, that escaped me still, but everything else. He must have\nrecognised me, for I have not changed very much in twenty years, and\nthat was why after that first morning he had never paused in front of my\ntable. Yes, it was twenty years since I had known him. I was spending a\nwinter in Rome and every evening I used to dine in a restaurant in the\nVia Sistina where you got excellent macaroni and a good bottle of wine.\nIt was frequented by a little band of English and American art students,\nand one or two writers; and we used to stay late into the night engaged\nin interminable arguments upon art and literature. He used to come in\nwith a young painter who was a friend of his. He was only a boy then, he\ncould not have been more than twenty-two; and with his blue eyes,\nstraight nose and red hair he was pleasing to look at. I remembered that\nhe spoke a great deal of Central America, he had had a job with the\nAmerican Fruit Company, but had thrown it over because he wanted to be a\nwriter. He was not popular among us because he was arrogant and we were\nnone of us old enough to take the arrogance of youth with tolerance. He\nthought us poor fish and did not hesitate to tell us so. He would not\nshow us his work, because our praise meant nothing to him and he\ndespised our censure. His vanity was enormous. It irritated us; but some\nof us were uneasily aware that it might perhaps be justified. Was it\npossible that the intense consciousness of genius that he had, rested on\nno grounds? He had sacrificed everything to be a writer. He was so\ncertain of himself that he infected some of his friends with his own\nassurance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI recalled his high spirits, his vitality, his confidence in the future\nand his disinterestedness. It was impossible that it was the same man,\nand yet I was sure of it. I stood up, paid for my drink and went out\ninto the plaza to find him. My thoughts were in a turmoil. I was aghast.\nI had thought of him now and then and idly wondered what had become of\nhim. I could never have imagined that he was reduced to this frightful\nmisery. There are hundreds, thousands of youths who enter upon the hard\ncalling of the arts with extravagant hopes; but for the most part they\ncome to terms with their mediocrity and find somewhere in life a niche\nwhere they can escape starvation. This was awful. I asked myself what\nhad happened. What hopes deferred had broken his spirit, what\ndisappointments shattered him and what lost illusions ground him to the\ndust? I asked myself if nothing could be done. I walked round the plaza.\nHe was not in the arcades. There was no hope of finding him in the crowd\nthat circled round the bandstand. The light was waning and I was afraid\nI had lost him. Then I passed the church and saw him sitting on the\nsteps. I cannot describe what a lamentable object he looked. Life had\ntaken him, rent him on its racks, torn him limb from limb, and then\nflung him, a bleeding wreck, on the stone steps of that church. I went\nup to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you remember Rome?\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not move. He did not answer. He took no more notice of me than if\nI were not standing before him. He did not look at me. His vacant blue\neyes rested on the buzzards that were screaming and tearing at some\nobject at the bottom of the steps. I did not know what to do. I took a\nyellow-backed note out of my pocket and pressed it in his hand. He did\nnot give it a glance. But his hand moved a little, the thin claw-like\nfingers closed on the note and scrunched it up; he made it into a little\nball and then edging it on to his thumb flicked it into the air so that\nit fell among the jangling buzzards. I turned my head instinctively and\nsaw one of them seize it in his beak and fly off followed by two others\nscreaming behind it. When I looked back the man was gone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI stayed three more days in Vera Cruz. I never saw him again.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nIt chanced that in August, 1917, the work upon which I was then engaged\nobliged me to go from New York to Petrograd and I was instructed for\nsafety's sake to travel by way of Vladivostok. I landed there in the\nmorning and passed an idle day as best I could. The Trans-Siberian train\nwas due to start, so far as I remember, at about nine in the evening. I\ndined at the station restaurant by myself. It was crowded and I shared a\nsmall table with a man whose appearance entertained me. He was a\nRussian, a tall fellow, but amazingly stout, and he had so vast a paunch\nthat he was obliged to sit well away from the table. His hands, small\nfor his size, were buried in rolls of fat. His hair, long, dark and\nthin, was brushed carefully across his crown in order to conceal his\nbaldness, and his huge sallow face, with its enormous double chin,\nclean-shaven, gave you an impression of indecent nakedness. His nose was\nsmall, a funny little button upon that mass of flesh, and his black\nshining eyes were small too. But he had a large, red and sensual mouth.\nHe was dressed neatly enough in a black suit. It was not worn but\nshabby; it looked as if it had been neither pressed nor brushed since he\nhad had it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe service was bad and it was almost impossible to attract the\nattention of a waiter. We soon got into conversation. The Russian spoke\ngood and fluent English. His accent was marked but not tiresome. He\nasked me many questions about myself and my plans, which--my occupation\nat the time making caution necessary--I answered with a show of\nfrankness but with dissimulation. I told him I was a journalist. He\nasked me whether I wrote fiction and when I confessed that in my leisure\nmoments I did, he began to talk of the later Russian novelists. He spoke\nintelligently. It was plain that he was a man of education.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBy this time we had persuaded the waiter to bring us some cabbage soup,\nand my acquaintance pulled a small bottle of vodka from his pocket which\nhe invited me to share. I do not know whether it was the vodka or the\nnatural loquaciousness of his race that made him communicative, but\npresently he told me, unasked, a good deal about himself. He was of\nnoble birth, it appeared, a lawyer by profession, and a radical. Some\ntrouble with the authorities had made it necessary for him to be much\nabroad, but now he was on his way home. Business had detained him at\nVladivostok, but he expected to start for Moscow in a week and if I went\nthere he would be charmed to see me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you married?\" he asked me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not see what business it was of his, but I told him that I was. He\nsighed a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am a widower,\" he said. \"My wife was a Swiss, a native of Geneva. She\nwas a very cultivated woman. She spoke English, German and Italian\nperfectly. French, of course, was her native tongue. Her Russian was\nmuch above the average for a foreigner. She had scarcely the trace of an\naccent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe called a waiter who was passing with a tray full of dishes and asked\nhim, I suppose--for then I knew hardly any Russian--how much longer we\nwere going to wait for the next course. The waiter, with a rapid but\npresumably reassuring exclamation, hurried on, and my friend sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Since the revolution the waiting in restaurants has become abominable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe lighted his twentieth cigarette and I, looking at my watch, wondered\nwhether I should get a square meal before it was time for me to start.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My wife was a very remarkable woman,\" he continued. \"She taught\nlanguages at one of the best schools for the daughters of noblemen in\nPetrograd. For a good many years we lived together on perfectly friendly\nterms. She was, however, of a jealous temperament and unfortunately she\nloved me to distraction.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was difficult for me to keep a straight face. He was one of the\nugliest men I had ever seen. There is sometimes a certain charm in the\nrubicund and jovial fat man, but this saturnine obesity was repulsive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do not pretend that I was faithful to her. She was not young when I\nmarried her and we had been married for ten years. She was small and\nthin, and she had a bad complexion. She had a bitter tongue. She was a\nwoman who suffered from a fury of possession, and she could not bear me\nto be attracted to anyone but her. She was jealous not only of the women\nI knew, but of my friends, my cat and my books. On one occasion in my\nabsence she gave away a coat of mine merely because I liked none of my\ncoats so well. But I am of an equable temperament. I will not deny that\nshe bored me, but I accepted her acrimonious disposition as an act of\nGod and no more thought of rebelling against it than I would against bad\nweather or a cold in the head. I denied her accusations as long as it\nwas possible to deny them, and when it was impossible I shrugged my\nshoulders and smoked a cigarette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The constant scenes she made me did not very much affect me. I led my\nown life. Sometimes, indeed, I wondered whether it was passionate love\nshe felt for me or passionate hate. It seemed to me that love and hate\nwere very near allied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So we might have continued to the end of the chapter if one night a\nvery curious thing had not happened. I was awakened by a piercing scream\nfrom my wife. Startled, I asked her what was the matter. She told me\nthat she had had a fearful nightmare; she had dreamt that I was trying\nto kill her. We lived at the top of a large house and the well round\nwhich the stairs climbed was broad. She had dreamt that just as we had\narrived at our own floor I had caught hold of her and attempted to throw\nher over the balusters. It was six storeys to the stone floor at the\nbottom and it meant certain death.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was much shaken. I did my best to soothe her. But next morning, and\nfor two or three days after, she referred to the subject again and,\nnotwithstanding my laughter, I saw that it dwelt in her mind. I could\nnot help thinking of it either, for this dream showed me something that\nI had never suspected. She thought I hated her, she thought I would\ngladly be rid of her; she knew of course that she was insufferable, and\nat some time or other the idea had evidently occurred to her that I was\ncapable of murdering her. The thoughts of men are incalculable and ideas\nenter our minds that we should be ashamed to confess. Sometimes I had\nwished that she might run away with a lover, sometimes that a painless\nand sudden death might give me my freedom; but never, never had the idea\ncome to me that I might deliberately rid myself of an intolerable\nburden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The dream made an extraordinary impression upon both of us. It\nfrightened my wife, and she became for a little less bitter and more\ntolerant. But when I walked up the stairs to our apartment it was\nimpossible for me not to look over the balusters and reflect how easy it\nwould be to do what she had dreamt. The balusters were dangerously low.\nA quick gesture and the thing was done. It was hard to put the thought\nout of my mind. Then some months later my wife awakened me one night. I\nwas very tired and I was exasperated. She was white and trembling. She\nhad had the dream again. She burst into tears and asked me if I hated\nher. I swore by all the saints of the Russian calendar that I loved her.\nAt last she went to sleep again. It was more than I could do. I lay\nawake. I seemed to see her falling down the well of the stairs, and I\nheard her shriek and the thud as she struck the stone floor. I could not\nhelp shivering.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Russian stopped and beads of sweat stood on his forehead. He had\ntold the story well and fluently so that I had listened with attention.\nThere was still some vodka in the bottle; he poured it out and swallowed\nit at a gulp.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And how did your wife eventually die?\" I asked after a pause.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took out a dirty handkerchief and wiped his forehead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By an extraordinary coincidence she was found late one night at the\nbottom of the stairs with her neck broken.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who found her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was found by one of the lodgers who came in shortly after the\ncatastrophe.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And where were you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI cannot describe the look he gave me of malicious cunning. His little\nblack eyes sparkled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was spending the evening with a friend of mine. I did not come in\ntill an hour later.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment the waiter brought us the dish of meat that we had\nordered, and the Russian fell upon it with good appetite. He shovelled\nthe food into his mouth in enormous mouthfuls.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was taken aback. Had he really been telling me in this hardly veiled\nmanner that he had murdered his wife? That obese and sluggish man did\nnot look like a murderer; I could not believe that he would have had the\ncourage. Or was he making a sardonic joke at my expense?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn a few minutes it was time for me to go and catch my train. I left him\nand I have not seen him since. But I have never been able to make up my\nmind whether he was serious or jesting.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nRichard Harenger was a happy man. Notwithstanding what the pessimists,\nfrom Ecclesiastes onwards, have said, this is not so rare a thing to\nfind in this unhappy world, but Richard Harenger knew it, and that is a\nvery rare thing indeed. The golden mean which the ancients so highly\nprized is out of fashion, and those who follow it must put up with\npolite derision from those who see no merit in self-restraint and no\nvirtue in common-sense. Richard Harenger shrugged a polite and amused\nshoulder. Let others live dangerously, let others burn with a hard\ngem-like flame, let others stake their fortunes on the turn of a card,\nwalk the tight-rope that leads to glory or the grave, or hazard their\nlives for a cause, a passion or an adventure. He neither envied the fame\ntheir exploits brought them nor wasted his pity on them when their\nefforts ended in disaster.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut it must not be inferred from this that Richard Harenger was a\nselfish or a callous man. He was neither. He was considerate and of a\ngenerous disposition. He was always ready to oblige a friend and he was\nsufficiently well off to be able to indulge himself in the pleasure of\nhelping others. He had some money of his own and he occupied in the Home\nOffice a position that brought him an adequate stipend. The work suited\nhim. It was regular, responsible and pleasant. Every day when he left\nthe office he went to his club to play bridge for a couple of hours, and\non Saturdays and Sundays he played golf. He went abroad for his\nholidays, staying at good hotels, and visited churches, galleries and\nmuseums. He was a regular first-nighter. He dined out a good deal. His\nfriends liked him. He was easy to talk to. He was well-read,\nknowledgeable and amusing. He was besides of a personable exterior, not\nremarkably handsome, but tall, slim and erect of carriage, with a lean,\nintelligent face; his hair was growing thin, for he was now approaching\nthe age of fifty, but his brown eyes retained their smile and his teeth\nwere all his own. He had from nature a good constitution and he had\nalways taken care of himself. There was no reason in the world why he\nshould not be a happy man, and if there had been in him a trace of\nself-complacency he might have claimed that he deserved to be.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had the good fortune even to sail safely through those perilous,\nunquiet straits of marriage in which so many wise and good men have made\nshipwreck. Married for love in the early twenties, his wife and he,\nafter some years of almost perfect felicity, had drifted gradually\napart. Neither of them wished to marry anyone else, so there was no\nquestion of divorce (which indeed Richard Harenger's situation in the\ngovernment service made undesirable), but for convenience sake, with the\nhelp of the family lawyer, they arranged a separation which left them\nfree to lead their lives as each one wished without interference from\nthe other. They parted with mutual expressions of respect and good will.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRichard Harenger sold his house in St. John's Wood and took a flat\nwithin convenient walking distance of Whitehall. It had a sitting-room\nwhich he lined with his books, a dining-room into which his Chippendale\nfurniture just fitted, a nice-sized bedroom for himself, and beyond the\nkitchen a couple of maids' rooms. He brought his cook, whom he had had\nfor many years, from St. John's Wood, but needing no longer so large a\nstaff dismissed the rest of the servants and applied at a registry\noffice for a house-parlourmaid. He knew exactly what he wanted and he\nexplained his needs to the superintendent of the agency with precision.\nHe wanted a maid who was not too young, first because young women are\nflighty and secondly because, though he was of mature age and a man of\nprinciple, people would talk, the porter and the tradesmen if nobody\nelse, and both for the sake of his own reputation and that of the young\nperson he considered that the applicant should have reached years of\ndiscretion. Besides that he wanted a maid who could clean silver well.\nHe had always had a fancy for old silver, and it was reasonable to\ndemand that the forks and spoons that had been used by a woman of\nquality under the reign of Queen Anne should be treated with tenderness\nand respect. He was of a hospitable nature and liked to give at least\nonce a week little dinners of not less than four people and not more\nthan eight. He could trust his cook to send in a meal that his guests\nwould take pleasure in eating and he desired his parlourmaid to wait\nwith neatness and dispatch. Then he needed a perfect valet. He dressed\nwell, in a manner that suited his age and condition, and he liked his\nclothes to be properly looked after. The parlourmaid he was looking for\nmust be able to press trousers and iron a tie, and he was very\nparticular that his shoes should be well shone. He had small feet and he\ntook a good deal of trouble to have well-cut shoes. He had a large\nsupply and he insisted that they should be treed up the moment he took\nthem off. Finally the flat must be kept clean and tidy. It was of course\nunderstood that any applicant for the post must be of irreproachable\ncharacter, sober, honest, reliable and of a pleasing exterior. In return\nfor this he was prepared to offer good wages, reasonable liberty and\nample holidays. The superintendent listened without batting an eyelash\nand, telling him that she was quite sure she could suit him, sent him a\nstring of candidates which proved that she had not paid the smallest\nattention to a word he said. He saw them all personally. Some were\nobviously inefficient, some looked fast, some were too old, others too\nyoung, some lacked the presence he thought essential; there was not one\nto whom he was inclined even to give a trial. He was a kindly, polite\nman and he declined their services with a smile and a pleasant\nexpression of regret. He did not lose patience. He was prepared to\ninterview house-parlourmaids till he found one who was suitable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow it is a funny thing about life, if you refuse to accept anything but\nthe best you very often get it: if you utterly decline to make do with\nwhat you can get, then somehow or other you are very likely to get what\nyou want. It is as though fate said, this man's a perfect fool, he's\nasking for perfection, and then just out of her feminine wilfulness\nflung it in his lap. One day the porter of the flats said to Richard\nHarenger out of a blue sky:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hear you're lookin' for a house-parlourmaid, sir. There's someone I\nknow lookin' for a situation as might do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can you recommend her personally?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRichard Harenger had the sound opinion that one servant's recommendation\nof another was worth much more than that of an employer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can vouch for her respectability. She's been in some very good\nsituations.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall be coming in to dress about seven. If that's convenient to her\nI could see her then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very good, sir. I'll see that she's told.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had not been in more than five minutes when the cook, having answered\na ring at the front door, came in and told him that the person the\nporter had spoken to him about had called.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Show her in,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned on some more light so that he could see what the applicant\nlooked like and, getting up, stood with his back to the fireplace. A\nwoman came in and stood just inside the door in a respectful attitude.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-evening,\" he said. \"What is your name?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pritchard, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How old are you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thirty-five, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, that's a reasonable age.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave his cigarette a puff and looked at her reflectively. She was on\nthe tall side, nearly as tall as he, but he guessed that she wore high\nheels. Her black dress fitted her station. She held herself well. She\nhad good features and a rather high colour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you take off your hat?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe did so and he saw that she had pale brown hair. It was neatly and\nbecomingly dressed. She looked strong and healthy. She was neither fat\nnor thin. In a proper uniform she would look very presentable. She was\nnot inconveniently handsome, but she was certainly a comely, in another\nclass of life you might almost have said a handsome, woman. He proceeded\nto ask her a number of questions. Her answers were satisfactory. She had\nleft her last place for an adequate reason. She had been trained under a\nbutler and appeared to be well acquainted with her duties. In her last\nplace she had been head parlourmaid of three, but she did not mind\nundertaking the work of the flat single-handed. She had valeted a\ngentleman before who had sent her to a tailor's to learn how to press\nclothes. She was a little shy, but neither timid nor ill-at-ease.\nRichard asked her his questions in his amiable, leisurely way and she\nanswered them with modest composure. He was considerably impressed. He\nasked her what references she could give. They seemed extremely\nsatisfactory.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now look here,\" he said, \"I'm very much inclined to engage you. But I\nhate changes, I've had my cook for twelve years: if you suit me and the\nplace suits you I hope you'll stay. I mean, I don't want you to come to\nme in three or four months and say that you're leaving to get married.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's not much fear of that, sir. I'm a widow. I don't believe\nmarriage is much catch for anyone in my position, sir. My husband never\ndid a stroke of work from the day I married him to the day he died, and\nI had to keep him. What I want now is a good home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm inclined to agree with you,\" he smiled. \"Marriage is a very good\nthing, but I think it's a mistake to make a habit of it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe very properly made no reply to this, but waited for him to announce\nhis decision. She did not seem anxious about it. He reflected that if\nshe was as competent as she appeared she must be well aware that she\nwould have no difficulty in finding a place. He told her what wages he\nwas offering and these seemed to be satisfactory to her. He gave her the\nnecessary information about the place, but she gave him to understand\nthat she was already apprised of this, and he received the impression,\nwhich amused rather than disconcerted him, that she had made certain\nenquiries about him before applying for the situation. It showed\nprudence on her part and good sense.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When would you be able to come in if I engaged you? I haven't got\nanybody at the moment. The cook's managing as best she can with a char,\nbut I should like to get settled as soon as possible.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, sir, I was going to give myself a week's holiday, but if it's a\nmatter of obliging a gentleman I don't mind giving that up. I could come\nin to-morrow if it was convenient.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRichard Harenger gave her his attractive smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shouldn't like you to do without a holiday that I dare say you've\nbeen looking forward to. I can very well go on like this for another\nweek. Go and have your holiday and come to me when it's over.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you very much, sir. Would it do if I came in to-morrow week?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen she left, Richard Harenger felt he had done a good day's work. It\nlooked as though he had found exactly what he was after. He rang for the\ncook and told her he had engaged a house-parlourmaid at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think you'll like her, sir,\" she said. \"She came in and 'ad a talk\nwith me this afternoon. I could see at once she knew her duties. And\nshe's not one of them flighty ones.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We can but try, Mrs. Jeddy. I hope you gave me a good character.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I said you was particular, sir. I said you was a gentleman as\nliked things just so.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I admit that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She said she didn't mind that. She said she liked a gentleman as knew\nwhat was what. She said there's no satisfaction in doing things proper\nif nobody notices. I expect you'll find she'll take a rare lot of pride\nin her work.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's what I want her to do. I think we might go farther and fare\nworse.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, sir, there is that to it, of course. And the proof of the\npudding's the eating. But if you ask my opinion I think she's going to\nbe a real treasure.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd that is precisely what Pritchard turned out. No man was ever better\nserved. The way she shone shoes was marvellous, and he set out of a fine\nmorning for his walk to the office with a more jaunty step because you\ncould almost see yourself reflected in them. She looked after his\nclothes with such attention that his colleagues began to chaff him about\nbeing the best-dressed man in the Civil Service. One day, coming home\nunexpectedly, he found a line of socks and handkerchiefs hung up to dry\nin the bathroom. He called Pritchard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you wash my socks and handkerchiefs yourself, Pritchard? I should\nhave thought you had enough to do without that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They do ruin them so at the laundry, sir. I prefer to do them at home\nif you have no objection.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe knew exactly what he should wear on every occasion, and without\nasking him was aware whether she should put out a dinner jacket and a\nblack tie in the evening or a dress coat and a white one. When he was\ngoing to a party where decorations were to be worn he found his neat\nlittle row of medals automatically affixed to the lapel of his coat. He\nsoon ceased to choose every morning from his wardrobe the tie he wanted,\nfor he found that she put out for him without fail the one he would have\nhimself selected. Her taste was perfect. He supposed she read his\nletters, for she always knew what his movements were, and if he had\nforgotten at what hour he had an engagement he had no need to look in\nhis book, for Pritchard could tell him. She knew exactly what tone to\nuse with persons with whom she conversed on the telephone. Except with\ntradesmen, with whom she was apt to be peremptory, she was always\npolite, but there was a distinct difference in her manner if she was\naddressing one of Mr. Harenger's literary friends or the wife of a\nCabinet Minister. She knew by instinct with whom he wished to speak and\nwith whom he didn't. From his sitting-room he sometimes heard her with\nplacid sincerity assuring a caller that he was out, and then she would\ncome in and tell him that So-and-So had rung up, but she thought he\nwouldn't wish to be disturbed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite right, Pritchard,\" he smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I knew she only wanted to bother you about that concert,\" said\nPritchard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis friends made appointments with him through her, and she would tell\nhim what she had done on his return in the evening.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Soames rang up, sir, and asked if you would lunch with her on\nThursday, the eighth, but I said you were very sorry but you were\nlunching with Lady Versinder. Mr. Oakley rang up and asked if you'd go\nto a cocktail party at the Savoy next Tuesday at six. I said you would\nif you possibly could, but you might have to go to the dentist's.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought you could see when the time came, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe kept the flat like a new pin. On one occasion soon after she entered\nhis service, Richard coming back from a holiday took out a book from his\nshelves and at once noticed that it had been dusted. He rang the bell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I forgot to tell you when I went away under no circumstances ever to\ntouch my books. When books are taken out to be dusted they're never put\nback in the right place. I don't mind my books being dirty, but I hate\nnot being able to find them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm very sorry, sir,\" said Pritchard. \"I know some gentlemen are very\nparticular and I took care to put back every book exactly where I took\nit from.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRichard Harenger gave his books a glance. So far as he could see every\none was in its accustomed place. He smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I apologise, Pritchard.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They were in a muck, sir. I mean, you couldn't open one without getting\nyour hands black with dust.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe certainly kept his silver as he had never had it kept before. He\nfelt called upon to give her a special word of praise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Most of it's Queen Anne and George I, you know,\" he explained.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I know, sir. When you've got something good like that to look\nafter it's a pleasure to keep it like it should be.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You certainly have a knack for it. I never knew a butler who kept his\nsilver as well as you do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Men haven't the patience women have,\" she replied modestly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs soon as he thought Pritchard had settled down in the place he resumed\nthe little dinners he was fond of giving once a week. He had already\ndiscovered that she knew how to wait at table, but it was with a warm\nsense of complacency that he realised then how competently she could\nmanage a party. She was quick, silent and watchful. A guest had hardly\nfelt the need of something before Pritchard was at his elbow offering\nhim what he wanted. She soon learned the tastes of his more intimate\nfriends and remembered that one liked water instead of soda with his\nwhisky and that another particularly fancied the knuckle end of a leg of\nlamb. She knew exactly how cold a hock should be not to ruin its taste\nand how long claret should have stood in the room to bring out its\nbouquet. It was a pleasure to see her pour out a bottle of burgundy in\nsuch a fashion as not to disturb the grounds. On one occasion she did\nnot serve the wine Richard had ordered. He somewhat sharply pointed this\nout to her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I opened the bottle sir, and it was slightly corked. So I got the\nChambertin, as I thought it was safer.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite right, Pritchard.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPresently he left this matter entirely in her hands, for he discovered\nthat she knew perfectly what wines his guests would like. Without orders\nfrom him she would provide the best in his cellar and his oldest brandy\nif she thought they were the sort of people who knew what they were\ndrinking. She had no belief in the palate of women, and when they were\nof the party was apt to serve the champagne which had to be drunk before\nit went off. She had the English servant's instinctive knowledge of\nsocial differences and neither rank nor money blinded her to the fact\nthat someone was not a gentleman, but she had favourites among his\nfriends, and when someone she particularly liked was dining, with the\nair of a cat that has swallowed a canary she would pour out for him a\nbottle of a wine that Harenger kept for very special occasions. It\namused him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got on the right side of Pritchard, old boy,\" he exclaimed.\n\"There aren't many people she gives this wine to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPritchard became an institution. She was known very soon to be the\nperfect parlourmaid. People envied Harenger the possession of her as\nthey envied nothing else that he had. She was worth her weight in gold.\nHer price was above rubies. Richard Harenger beamed with\nself-complacency when they praised her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good masters make good servants,\" he said gaily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne evening, when they were sitting over their port and she had left the\nroom, they were talking about her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It'll be an awful blow when she leaves you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why should she leave me? One or two people have tried to get her away\nfrom me, but she turned them down. She knows where she's well off.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She'll get married one of these days.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think she's that sort.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's a good-looking woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, she has quite a decent presence.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you talking about? She's a very handsome creature. In another\nclass of life she'd be a well-known society beauty with her photograph\nin all the papers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment Pritchard came in with the coffee. Richard Harenger\nlooked at her. After seeing her every day, off and on, for four years it\nwas now--my word, how time flies--he had really forgotten what she\nlooked like. She did not seem to have changed much since he had first\nseen her. She was no stouter than then, she still had the high colour,\nand her regular features bore the same expression which was at once\nintent and vacuous. The black uniform suited her. She left the room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's a paragon and there's no doubt about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know she is,\" answered Harenger. \"She's perfection. I should be lost\nwithout her. And the strange thing is that I don't very much like her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why not?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think she bores me a little. You see, she has no conversation. I've\noften tried to talk to her. She answers when I speak to her, but that's\nall. In four years she's never volunteered a remark of her own. I know\nabsolutely nothing about her. I don't know if she likes me or if she's\ncompletely indifferent to me. She's an automaton. I respect her, I\nappreciate her, I trust her. She has every quality in the world and I've\noften wondered why it is that with all that I'm so completely\nindifferent to her. I think it must be that she is entirely devoid of\ncharm.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey left it at that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTwo or three days after this, since it was Pritchard's night out and he\nhad no engagement, Richard Harenger dined by himself at his club. A\npage-boy came to him and told him that they had just rung up from his\nflat to say that he had gone out without his keys and should they be\nbrought along to him in a taxi? He put his hand to his pocket. It was a\nfact. By a singular chance he had forgotten to replace them when he had\nchanged into a blue serge suit before coming out to dinner. His\nintention had been to play bridge, but it was an off-night at the club\nand there seemed little chance of a decent game; it occurred to him that\nit would be a good opportunity to see a picture that he had heard talked\nabout, so he sent back the message by the page that he would call for\nthe keys himself in half an hour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe rang at the door of his flat and it was opened by Pritchard. She had\nthe keys in her hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you doing here, Pritchard?\" he asked. \"It's your night out,\nisn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, sir. But I didn't care about going, so I told Mrs. Jeddy she could\ngo instead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You ought to get out when you have the chance,\" he said, with his usual\nthoughtfulness. \"It's not good for you to be cooped up here all the\ntime.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I get out now and then on an errand, but I haven't been out in the\nevening for the last month.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why on earth not?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it's not very cheerful going out by yourself, and somehow I don't\nknow anyone just now that I'm particularly keen on going out with.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You ought to have a bit of fun now and then. It's good for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got out of the habit of it somehow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, I'm just going to the cinema. Would you like to come along\nwith me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe spoke in kindliness, on the spur of the moment, and the moment he had\nsaid the words half regretted them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, sir, I'd like to,\" said Pritchard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Run along then and put on a hat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shan't be a minute.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe disappeared and he went into the sitting-room and lit a cigarette.\nHe was a little amused at what he was doing, and pleased too; it was\nnice to be able to make someone happy with so little trouble to himself.\nIt was characteristic of Pritchard that she had shown neither surprise\nnor hesitation. She kept him waiting about five minutes, and when she\ncame back he noticed that she had changed her dress. She wore a blue\nfrock in what he supposed was artificial silk, a small black hat with a\nblue brooch on it, and a silver fox round her neck. He was a trifle\nrelieved to see that she looked neither shabby nor showy. It would never\noccur to anyone who happened to see them that this was a distinguished\nofficial in the Home Office taking his housemaid to the pictures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It doesn't matter at all,\" he said graciously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe opened the front door for her and she went out before him. He\nremembered the familiar anecdote of Louis XIV and the courtier and\nappreciated the fact that she had not hesitated to precede him. The\ncinema for which they were bound was at no great distance from Mr.\nHarenger's flat and they walked there. He talked about the weather and\nthe state of the roads and Adolf Hitler. Pritchard made suitable\nreplies. They arrived just as Mickey the Mouse was starting and this put\nthem in a good humour. During the four years she had been in his service\nRichard Harenger had hardly ever seen Pritchard even smile, and now it\ndiverted him vastly to hear her peal upon peal of joyous laughter. He\nenjoyed her pleasure. Then the principal attraction was thrown on the\nscreen. It was a good picture and they both watched it with breathless\nexcitement. Taking his cigarette-case out to help himself he\nautomatically offered it to Pritchard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you, sir,\" she said, taking one.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe lit it for her. Her eyes were on the screen and she was almost\nunconscious of his action. When the picture was finished they streamed\nout with the crowd into the street. They walked back towards the flat.\nIt was a fine starry night.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you like it?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Like anything, sir. It was a real treat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA thought occurred to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, did you have any supper to-night?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, sir, I didn't have time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Aren't you starving?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll have a bit of bread and cheese when I get in and I'll make meself\na cup of cocoa.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That sounds rather grim.\" There was a feeling of gaiety in the air, and\nthe people who poured past them, one way and another, seemed filled with\na pleasant elation. In for a penny, in for a pound, he said to himself.\n\"Look here, would you like to come and have a bit of supper with me\nsomewhere?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you'd like to, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come on.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe hailed a cab. He was feeling very philanthropic and it was not a\nfeeling that he disliked at all. He told the driver to go to a\nrestaurant in Oxford Street which was gay, but at which he was confident\nthere was no chance of meeting anyone he knew. There was an orchestra\nand people danced. It would amuse Pritchard to see them. When they sat\ndown a waiter came up to them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They've got a set supper here,\" he said, thinking that was what she\nwould like. \"I suggest we have that. What would you like to drink? A\nlittle white wine?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What I really fancy is a glass of ginger beer,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRichard Harenger ordered himself a whisky and soda. She ate the supper\nwith hearty appetite, and though Harenger was not hungry, to put her at\nher ease he ate too. The picture they had just seen gave them something\nto talk about. It was quite true what they had said the other night,\nPritchard was not a bad-looking woman, and even if someone had seen them\ntogether he would not have minded. It would make rather a good story for\nhis friends when he told them how he had taken the incomparable\nPritchard to the cinema and then afterwards to supper. Pritchard was\nlooking at the dancers with a faint smile on her lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you like dancing?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I used to be a rare one for it when I was a girl. I never danced much\nafter I was married. My husband was a bit shorter than me and somehow I\nnever think it looks well unless the gentleman's taller, if you know\nwhat I mean. I suppose I shall be getting too old for it soon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRichard was certainly taller than his parlourmaid. They would look all\nright. He was fond of dancing and he danced well. But he hesitated. He\ndid not want to embarrass Pritchard by asking her to dance with him. It\nwas better not to go too far perhaps. And yet what did it matter? It was\na drab life she led. She was so sensible, if she thought it a mistake he\nwas pretty sure she would find a decent excuse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would you like to take a turn, Pritchard?\" he said, as the band struck\nup again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm terribly out of practice, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does that matter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you don't mind, sir,\" she answered coolly, rising from her seat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was not in the least shy. She was only afraid that she would not be\nable to follow his step. They moved on to the floor. He found she danced\nvery well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, you dance perfectly, Pritchard,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's coming back to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlthough she was a big woman she was light on her feet and she had a\nnatural sense of rhythm. She was very pleasant to dance with. He gave a\nglance at the mirrors that lined the walls and he could not help\nreflecting that they looked very well together. Their eyes met in the\nmirror; he wondered whether she was thinking that too. They had two more\ndances and then Richard Harenger suggested that they should go. He paid\nthe bill and they walked out. He noticed that she threaded her way\nthrough the crowd without a trace of self-consciousness. They got into a\ntaxi and in ten minutes were at home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll go up the back way, sir,\" said Pritchard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no need to do that. Come up in the lift with me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took her up, giving the night-porter an icy glance, so that he should\nnot think it strange that he came back at that somewhat late hour with\nhis parlourmaid, and with his latch-key let her into the flat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, good-night, sir,\" she said. \"Thank you very much. It's been a\nreal treat for me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank <i>you</i> Pritchard. I should have had a very dull evening by myself.\nI hope you've enjoyed your outing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That I have, sir, more than I can say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt had been a success. Richard Harenger was satisfied with himself. It\nwas a kindly thing for him to have done. It was a very agreeable\nsensation to give anyone so much real pleasure. His benevolence warmed\nhim and for a moment he felt a great love in his heart for the whole\nhuman race.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-night, Pritchard,\" he said, and because he felt happy and good he\nput his arm round her waist and kissed her on the lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer lips were very soft. They lingered on his and she returned his kiss.\nIt was the warm, hearty embrace of a healthy woman in the prime of life.\nHe found it very pleasant and he held her to him a little more closely.\nShe put her arms round his neck.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs a general rule he did not wake till Pritchard came in with his\nletters, but next morning he woke at half-past seven. He had a curious\nsensation that he did not recognise. He was accustomed to sleep with two\npillows under his head and he suddenly grew aware of the fact that he\nhad only one. Then he remembered and with a start looked round. The\nother pillow was beside his own. Thank God, no sleeping head rested\nthere, but it was plain that one had. His heart sank. He broke out into\na cold sweat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My God, what a fool I've been!\" he cried out loud.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHow could he have done anything so stupid? What on earth had come over\nhim? He was the last man to play about with servant girls. What a\ndisgraceful thing to do! At his age and in his position. He had not\nheard Pritchard slip away. He must have been asleep. It wasn't even as\nif he'd liked her very much. She wasn't his type. And, as he had said\nthe other night, she rather bored him. Even now he only knew her as\nPritchard. He had no notion what her first name was. What madness! And\nwhat was to happen now? The position was impossible. It was obvious he\ncouldn't keep her, and yet to send her away for what was his fault as\nmuch as hers seemed shockingly unfair. How idiotic to lose the best\nparlourmaid a man ever had just for an hour's folly!\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's that damned kindness of heart of mine,\" he groaned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe would never find anyone else to look after his clothes so admirably\nor clean the silver so well. She knew all his friends' telephone numbers\nand she understood wine. But of course she must go. She must see for\nherself that after what had happened things could never be the same. He\nwould make her a handsome present and give her an excellent reference.\nAt any minute she would be coming in now. Would she be arch, would she\nbe familiar? Or would she put on airs? Perhaps even she wouldn't trouble\nto come in with his letters. It would be awful if he had to ring the\nbell and Mrs. Jeddy came in and said: Pritchard's not up yet, sir, she's\nhaving a lie in after last night.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a fool I've been! What a contemptible cad!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a knock at the door. He was sick with anxiety.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRichard Harenger was a very unhappy man.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPritchard came in as the clock struck. She wore the print dress she was\nin the habit of wearing during the early part of the day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-morning, sir,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe drew the curtains and handed him his letters and the papers. Her\nface was impassive. She looked exactly as she always looked. Her\nmovements had the same competent deliberation that they always had. She\nneither avoided Richard's glance nor sought it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you wear your grey, sir? It came back from the tailor's\nyesterday.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe pretended to read his letters, but he watched her from under his\neyelashes. Her back was turned to him. She took his vest and drawers and\nfolded them over a chair. She took the studs out of the shirt he had\nworn the day before and studded a clean one. She put out some clean\nsocks for him and placed them on the seat of a chair with the suspenders\nto match by the side. Then she put out his grey suit and attached the\nbraces to the back buttons of the trousers. She opened his wardrobe and\nafter a moment's reflection chose a tie to go with the suit. She\ncollected on her arm the suit of the day before and picked up the shoes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you have breakfast now, sir, or will you have your bath first?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll have breakfast now,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith her slow quiet movements, unruffled, she left the room. Her face\nbore that rather serious, deferential, vacuous look it always bore. What\nhad happened might have been a dream. Nothing in Pritchard's demeanour\nsuggested that she had the smallest recollection of the night before. He\ngave a sigh of relief. It was going to be all right. She need not go,\nshe need not go. Pritchard was the perfect parlourmaid. He knew that\nnever by word nor gesture would she ever refer to the fact that for a\nmoment their relations had been other than those of master and servant.\nRichard Harenger was a very happy man.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nAll this happened two or three years before the outbreak of the war.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Peregrines were having breakfast. Though they were alone and the\ntable was long they sat at opposite ends of it. From the walls George\nPeregrine's ancestors, painted by the fashionable painters of the day,\nlooked down upon them. The butler brought in the morning post. There\nwere several letters for the colonel, business letters, <i>The Times</i> and\na small parcel for his wife Evie. He looked at his letters and then,\nopening <i>The Times</i>, began to read it. They finished breakfast and rose\nfrom the table. He noticed that his wife hadn't opened the parcel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's that?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Only some books.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shall I open it for you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe hated to cut string and so with some difficulty untied the knots.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But they're all the same,\" he said when he had unwrapped the parcel.\n\"What on earth d'you want six copies of the same book for?\" He opened\none of them. \"Poetry.\" Then he looked at the title page. <i>When Pyramids\nDecay</i>, he read, by E. K. Hamilton. Eva Katherine Hamilton: that was his\nwife's maiden name. He looked at her with smiling surprise. \"Have you\nwritten a book, Evie? You are a slyboots.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't think it would interest you very much. Would you like a copy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you know poetry isn't much in my line, but--yes, I'd like a copy;\nI'll read it. I'll take it along to my study. I've got a lot to do this\nmorning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gathered up <i>The Times</i>, his letters and the book, and went out. His\nstudy was a large and comfortable room, with a big desk, leather\narm-chairs and what he called \"trophies of the chase\" on the walls. On\nthe bookshelves were works of reference, books on farming, gardening,\nfishing and shooting, and books on the last war, in which he had won an\nM.C. and a D.S.O. For before his marriage he had been in the Welsh\nGuards. At the end of the war he retired and settled down to the life of\na country gentleman in the spacious house, some twenty miles from\nSheffield, which one of his forebears had built in the reign of George\nIII. George Peregrine had an estate of some fifteen hundred acres which\nhe managed with ability; he was a Justice of the Peace and performed his\nduties conscientiously. During the season he rode to hounds two days a\nweek. He was a good shot, a golfer and though now a little over fifty\ncould still play a hard game of tennis. He could describe himself with\npropriety as an all-round sportsman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had been putting on weight lately, but was still a fine figure of a\nman; tall, with grey curly hair, only just beginning to grow thin on the\ncrown, frank blue eyes, good features and a high colour. He was a\npublic-spirited man, chairman of any number of local organisations and,\nas became his class and station, a loyal member of the Conservative\nParty. He looked upon it as his duty to see to the welfare of the people\non his estate and it was a satisfaction to him to know that Evie could\nbe trusted to tend the sick and succour the poor. He had built a cottage\nhospital on the outskirts of the village and paid the wages of a nurse\nout of his own pocket. All he asked of the recipients of his bounty was\nthat at elections, county or general, they should vote for his\ncandidate. He was a friendly man, affable to his inferiors, considerate\nwith his tenants and popular with the neighbouring gentry. He would have\nbeen pleased and at the same time slightly embarrassed if someone had\ntold him he was a jolly good fellow. That was what he wanted to be. He\ndesired no higher praise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was hard luck that he had no children. He would have been an\nexcellent father, kindly but strict, and would have brought up his sons\nas gentlemen's sons should be brought up, sent them to Eton, you know,\ntaught them to fish, shoot and ride. As it was, his heir was a nephew,\nson of his brother killed in a motor accident, not a bad boy, but not a\nchip off the old block, no, sir, far from it; and would you believe it,\nhis fool of a mother was sending him to a co-educational school. Evie\nhad been a sad disappointment to him. Of course she was a lady, and she\nhad a bit of money of her own; she managed the house uncommonly well and\nshe was a good hostess. The village people adored her. She had been a\npretty little thing when he married her, with a creamy skin, light brown\nhair and a trim figure, healthy too and not a bad tennis player; he\ncouldn't understand why she'd had no children; of course she was faded\nnow, she must be getting on for five and forty; her skin was drab, her\nhair had lost its sheen and she was as thin as a rail. She was always\nneat and suitably dressed, but she didn't seem to bother how she looked,\nshe wore no make-up and didn't even use lipstick; sometimes at night\nwhen she dolled herself up for a party you could tell that once she'd\nbeen quite attractive, but ordinarily she was--well, the sort of woman\nyou simply didn't notice. A nice woman, of course, a good wife, and it\nwasn't her fault if she was barren, but it was tough on a fellow who\nwanted an heir of his own loins; she hadn't any vitality, that's what\nwas the matter with her. He supposed he'd been in love with her when he\nasked her to marry him, at least sufficiently in love for a man who\nwanted to marry and settle down, but with time he discovered that they\nhad nothing much in common. She didn't care about hunting, and fishing\nbored her. Naturally they'd drifted apart. He had to do her the justice\nto admit that she'd never bothered him. There'd been no scenes. They had\nno quarrels. She seemed to take it for granted that he should go his own\nway. When he went up to London now and then she never wanted to come\nwith him. He had a girl there, well, she wasn't exactly a girl, she was\nthirty-five if she was a day, but she was blonde and luscious and he\nonly had to wire ahead of time and they'd dine, do a show and spend the\nnight together. Well, a man, a healthy normal man had to have some fun\nin his life. The thought crossed his mind that if Evie hadn't been such\na good woman she'd have been a better wife; but it was not the sort of\nthought that he welcomed and he put it away from him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Peregrine finished his <i>Times</i> and being a considerate fellow\nrang the bell and told the butler to take it to Evie. Then he looked at\nhis watch. It was half-past ten and at eleven he had an appointment with\none of his tenants. He had half an hour to spare.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd better have a look at Evie's book,\" he said to himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took it up with a smile. Evie had a lot of highbrow books in her\nsitting-room, not the sort of books that interested him, but if they\namused her he had no objection to her reading them. He noticed that the\nvolume he now held in his hand contained no more than ninety pages. That\nwas all to the good. He shared Edgar Allan Poe's opinion that poems\nshould be short. But as he turned the pages he noticed that several of\nEvie's had long lines of irregular length and didn't rhyme. He didn't\nlike that. At his first school, when he was a little boy, he remembered\nlearning a poem that began: <i>The boy stood on the burning deck</i>, and\nlater, at Eton, one that started: <i>Ruin seize thee, ruthless king</i>; and\nthen there was Henry V; they'd had to take that, one half. He stared at\nEvie's pages with consternation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's not what I call poetry,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFortunately it wasn't all like that. Interspersed with the pieces that\nlooked so odd, lines of three or four words and then a line of ten or\nfifteen, there were little poems, quite short, that rhymed, thank God,\nwith the lines all the same length. Several of the pages were just\nheaded with the word Sonnet, and out of curiosity he counted the lines;\nthere were fourteen of them. He read them. They seemed all right, but he\ndidn't quite know what they were all about. He repeated to himself:\n<i>Ruin seize thee, ruthless king</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor Evie,\" he sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment the farmer he was expecting was ushered into the study,\nand putting the book down he made him welcome. They embarked on their\nbusiness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I read your book, Evie,\" he said as they sat down to lunch. \"Jolly\ngood. Did it cost you a packet to have it printed?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I was lucky. I sent it to a publisher and he took it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not much money in poetry, my dear,\" he said in his good-natured, hearty\nway.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I don't suppose there is. What did Bannock want to see you about\nthis morning?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBannock was the tenant who had interrupted his reading of Evie's poems.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's asked me to advance the money for a pedigree bull he wants to buy.\nHe's a good man and I've half a mind to do it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Peregrine saw that Evie didn't want to talk about her book and he\nwas not sorry to change the subject. He was glad she had used her maiden\nname on the title page; he didn't suppose anyone would ever hear about\nthe book, but he was proud of his own unusual name and he wouldn't have\nliked it if some damned penny-a-liner had made fun of Evie's effort in\none of the papers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDuring the few weeks that followed he thought it tactful not to ask Evie\nany questions about her venture into verse, and she never referred to\nit. It might have been a discreditable incident that they had silently\nagreed not to mention. But then a strange thing happened. He had to go\nto London on business and he took Daphne out to dinner. That was the\nname of the girl with whom he was in the habit of passing a few\nagreeable hours whenever he went to town.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, George,\" she said, \"is that your wife who's written a book they're\nall talking about?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What on earth d'you mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, there's a fellow I know who's a critic. He took me out to dinner\nthe other night and he had a book with him. 'Got anything for me to\nread?' I said. 'What's that?' 'Oh, I don't think that's your cup of\ntea,' he said. 'It's poetry. I've just been reviewing it.' 'No poetry\nfor me,' I said. 'It's about the hottest stuff I ever read,' he said.\n'Selling like hot cakes. And it's damned good.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who's the book by?\" asked George.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A woman called Hamilton. My friend told me that wasn't her real name.\nHe said her real name was Peregrine. 'Funny,' I said, 'I know a fellow\ncalled Peregrine.' 'Colonel in the army,' he said. 'Lives near\nSheffield.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd just as soon you didn't talk about me to your friends,\" said George\nwith a frown of vexation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Keep your shirt on, dearie. Who d'you take me for? I just said: 'It's\nnot the same one.'\" Daphne giggled. \"My friend said: 'They say he's a\nregular Colonel Blimp.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge had a keen sense of humour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You could tell them better than that,\" he laughed. \"If my wife had\nwritten a book I'd be the first to know about it, wouldn't I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you would.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnyhow the matter didn't interest her and when the colonel began to talk\nof other things she forgot about it. He put it out of his mind too.\nThere was nothing to it, he decided, and that silly fool of a critic had\njust been pulling Daphne's leg. He was amused at the thought of her\ntackling that book because she had been told it was hot stuff and then\nfinding it just a lot of bosh cut up into unequal lines.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was a member of several clubs and next day he thought he'd lunch at\none in St. James's Street. He was catching a train back to Sheffield\nearly in the afternoon. He was sitting in a comfortable arm-chair having\na glass of sherry before going into the dining-room when an old friend\ncame up to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, old boy, how's life?\" he said. \"How d'you like being the husband\nof a celebrity?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Peregrine looked at his friend. He thought he saw an amused\ntwinkle in his eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come off it, George. Everyone knows E. K. Hamilton is your wife. Not\noften a book of verse has a success like that. Look here, Henry Dashwood\nis lunching with me. He'd like to meet you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who the devil is Henry Dashwood and why should he want to meet me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my dear fellow, what do you do with yourself all the time in the\ncountry? Henry's about the best critic we've got. He wrote a wonderful\nreview of Evie's book. D'you mean to say she didn't show it you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBefore George could answer his friend had called a man over. A tall,\nthin man, with a high forehead, a beard, a long nose and a stoop, just\nthe sort of man whom George was prepared to dislike at first sight.\nIntroductions were effected. Henry Dashwood sat down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is Mrs. Peregrine in London by any chance? I should very much like to\nmeet her,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, my wife doesn't like London. She prefers the country,\" said George\nstiffly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She wrote me a very nice letter about my review. I was pleased. You\nknow, we critics get more kicks than halfpence. I was simply bowled over\nby her book. It's so fresh and original, very modern without being\nobscure. She seems to be as much at her ease in free verse as in the\nclassical metres.\" Then because he was a critic he thought he should\ncriticise. \"Sometimes her ear is a trifle at fault, but you can say the\nsame of Emily Dickinson. There are several of those short lyrics of hers\nthat might have been written by Landor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAll this was gibberish to George Peregrine. The man was nothing but a\ndisgusting highbrow. But the colonel had good manners and he answered\nwith proper civility: Henry Dashwood went on as though he hadn't spoken.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what makes the book so outstanding is the passion that throbs in\nevery line. So many of these young poets are so anæmic, cold, bloodless,\ndully intellectual, but here you have real naked, earthy passion; of\ncourse deep, sincere emotion like that is tragic----ah, my dear Colonel,\nhow right Heine was when he said that the poet makes little songs out of\nhis great sorrows. You know, now and then, as I read and re-read those\nheartrending pages I thought of Sappho.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis was too much for George Peregrine and he got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it's jolly nice of you to say such nice things about my wife's\nlittle book. I'm sure she'll be delighted. But I must bolt, I've got to\ncatch a train and I want to get a bite of lunch.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damned fool,\" he said irritably to himself as he walked upstairs to the\ndining-room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got home in time for dinner and after Evie had gone to bed he went\ninto his study and looked for her book. He thought he'd just glance\nthrough it again to see for himself what they were making such a fuss\nabout, but he couldn't find it. Evie must have taken it away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Silly,\" he muttered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe'd told her he thought it jolly good. What more could a fellow be\nexpected to say? Well, it didn't matter. He lit his pipe and read the\n<i>Field</i> till he felt sleepy. But a week or so later it happened that he\nhad to go into Sheffield for the day. He lunched there at his club. He\nhad nearly finished when the Duke of Haverel came in. This was the great\nlocal magnate and of course the colonel knew him, but only to say how\nd'you do to; and he was surprised when the Duke stopped at his table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We're so sorry your wife couldn't come to us for the week-end,\" he\nsaid, with a sort of shy cordiality. \"We're expecting rather a nice lot\nof people.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge was taken aback. He guessed that the Haverels had asked him and\nEvie over for the week-end and Evie, without saying a word to him about\nit, had refused. He had the presence of mind to say he was sorry too.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Better luck next time,\" said the Duke pleasantly and moved on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nColonel Peregrine was very angry and when he got home he said to his\nwife:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, what's this about our being asked over to Haverel? Why on\nearth did you say we couldn't go? We've never been asked before and it's\nthe best shooting in the county.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't think of that. I thought it would only bore you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damn it all, you might at least have asked me if I wanted to go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at her closely. There was something in her expression that he\ndidn't quite understand. He frowned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose <i>I</i> was asked?\" he barked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEvie flushed a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, in point of fact you weren't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I call it damned rude of them to ask you without asking me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose they thought it wasn't your sort of party. The Duchess is\nrather fond of writers and people like that, you know. She's having\nHenry Dashwood, the critic, and for some reason he wants to meet me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was damned nice of you to refuse, Evie.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's the least I could do,\" she smiled. She hesitated a moment.\n\"George, my publishers want to give a little dinner-party for me one day\ntowards the end of the month and of course they want you to come too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I don't think that's quite my mark. I'll come up to London with you\nif you like. I'll find someone to dine with.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDaphne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I expect it'll be very dull, but they're making rather a point of it.\nAnd the day after, the American publisher who's taken my book is giving\na cocktail party at Claridge's. I'd like to you come to that if you\nwouldn't mind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sounds like a crashing bore, but if you really want me to come I'll\ncome.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be sweet of you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Peregrine was dazed by the cocktail party. There were a lot of\npeople. Some of them didn't look so bad, a few of the women were\ndecently turned out, but the men seemed to him pretty awful. He was\nintroduced to everyone as Colonel Peregrine, E. K. Hamilton's husband,\nyou know. The men didn't seem to have anything to say to him, but the\nwomen gushed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You <i>must</i> be proud of your wife. Isn't it <i>wonderful</i>? You know, I\nread it right through at a sitting, I simply couldn't put it down, and\nwhen I'd finished I started again at the beginning and read it right\nthrough a second time. I was simply <i>thrilled</i>.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe English publisher said to him:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We've not had a success like this with a book of verse for twenty\nyears. I've never seen such reviews.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe American publisher said to him:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's swell. It'll be a smash hit in America. You wait and see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe American publisher had sent Evie a great spray of orchids. Damned\nridiculous, thought George. As they came in, people were taken up to\nEvie, and it was evident that they said flattering things to her, which\nshe took with a pleasant smile and a word or two of thanks. She was a\ntrifle flushed with the excitement, but seemed quite at her ease. Though\nhe thought the whole thing a lot of stuff and nonsense George noted with\napproval that his wife was carrying it off in just the right way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, there's one thing,\" he said to himself, \"you can see she's a lady\nand that's a damned sight more than you can say of anyone else here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe drank a good many cocktails. But there was one thing that bothered\nhim. He had a notion that some of the people he was introduced to looked\nat him in rather a funny sort of way, he couldn't quite make out what it\nmeant, and once when he strolled by two women who were sitting together\non a sofa he had the impression that they were talking about him and\nafter he passed he was almost certain they tittered. He was very glad\nwhen the party came to an end.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the taxi on their way back to their hotel Evie said to him:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You were wonderful, dear. You made quite a hit. The girls simply raved\nabout you: they thought you so handsome.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Girls,\" he said bitterly. \"Old hags.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Were you bored, dear?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Stiff.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe pressed his hand in a gesture of sympathy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope you won't mind if we wait and go down by the afternoon train.\nI've got some things to do in the morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, that's all right. Shopping?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do want to buy one or two things, but I've got to go and be\nphotographed. I hate the idea, but they think I ought to be. For\nAmerica, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe said nothing. But he thought. He thought it would be a shock to the\nAmerican public when they saw the portrait of the homely, desiccated\nlittle woman who was his wife. He'd always been under the impression\nthat they liked glamour in America.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went on thinking, and next morning when Evie had gone out he went to\nhis club and up to the library. There he looked up recent numbers of\n<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>, <i>The New Statesman</i> and <i>The\nSpectator</i>. Presently he found reviews of Evie's book. He didn't read\nthem very carefully, but enough to see that they were extremely\nfavourable. Then he went to the bookseller's in Piccadilly where he\noccasionally bought books. He'd made up his mind that he had to read\nthis damned thing of Evie's properly, but he didn't want to ask her what\nshe'd done with the copy she'd given him. He'd buy one for himself.\nBefore going in he looked in the window and the first thing he saw was a\ndisplay of <i>When Pyramids Decay</i>. Damned silly title! He went in. A\nyoung man came forward and asked if he could help him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I'm just having a look round.\" It embarrassed him to ask for Evie's\nbook and he thought he'd find it for himself and then take it to the\nsalesman. But he couldn't see it anywhere and at last, finding the young\nman near him, he said in a carefully casual tone: \"By the way, have you\ngot a book called <i>When Pyramids Decay</i>?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The new edition came in this morning. I'll get a copy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn a moment the young man returned with it. He was a short, rather stout\nyoung man, with a shock of untidy carroty hair and spectacles. George\nPeregrine, tall, upstanding, very military, towered over him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is this a new edition then?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, sir. The fifth. It might be a novel the way it's selling.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Peregrine hesitated a moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why d'you suppose it's such a success? I've always been told no one\nreads poetry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it's good, you know. I've read it meself.\" The young man, though\nobviously cultured, had a slight Cockney accent, and George quite\ninstinctively adopted a patronising attitude. \"It's the story they like.\nSexy, you know, but tragic.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge frowned a little. He was coming to the conclusion that the young\nman was rather impertinent. No one had told him anything about there\nbeing a story in the damned book and he had not gathered that from\nreading the reviews. The young man went on:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course it's only a flash in the pan, if you know what I mean. The\nway I look at it, she was sort of inspired like by a personal\nexperience, like Housman was with <i>The Shropshire Lad</i>. She'll never\nwrite anything else.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How much is the book?\" said George coldly to stop his chatter. \"You\nneedn't wrap it up, I'll just slip it into my pocket.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe November morning was raw and he was wearing a greatcoat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt the station he bought the evening papers and magazines and he and\nEvie settled themselves comfortably in opposite corners of a first-class\ncarriage and read. At five o'clock they went along to the restaurant-car\nto have tea and chatted a little. They arrived. They drove home in the\ncar which was waiting for them. They bathed, dressed for dinner, and\nafter dinner Evie, saying she was tired out, went to bed. She kissed\nhim, as was her habit, on the forehead. Then he went into the hall, took\nEvie's book out of his greatcoat pocket and going into the study began\nto read it. He didn't read verse very easily and though he read with\nattention, every word of it, the impression he received was far from\nclear. Then he began at the beginning again and read it a second time.\nHe read with increasing malaise, but he was not a stupid man and when he\nhad finished he had a distinct understanding of what it was all about.\nPart of the book was in free verse, part in conventional metres, but the\nstory it related was coherent and plain to the meanest intelligence. It\nwas the story of a passionate love affair between an older woman,\nmarried, and a young man. George Peregrine made out the steps of it as\neasily as if he had been doing a sum in simple addition.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWritten in the first person, it began with the tremulous surprise of the\nwoman, past her youth, when it dawned upon her that the young man was in\nlove with her. She hesitated to believe it. She thought she must be\ndeceiving herself. And she was terrified when on a sudden she discovered\nthat she was passionately in love with him. She told herself it was\nabsurd; with the disparity of age between them nothing but unhappiness\ncould come to her if she yielded to her emotion. She tried to prevent\nhim from speaking but the day came when he told her that he loved her\nand forced her to tell him that she loved him too. He begged her to run\naway with him. She couldn't leave her husband, her home; and what life\ncould they look forward to, she an ageing woman, he so young? How could\nshe expect his love to last? She begged him to have mercy on her. But\nhis love was impetuous. He wanted her, he wanted her with all his heart,\nand at last trembling, afraid, desirous, she yielded to him. Then there\nwas a period of ecstatic happiness. The world, the dull, humdrum world\nof every day, blazed with glory. Love songs flowed from her pen. The\nwoman worshipped the young, virile body of her lover. George flushed\ndarkly when she praised his broad chest and slim flanks, the beauty of\nhis legs and the flatness of his belly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHot stuff, Daphne's friend had said. It was that all right. Disgusting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere were sad little pieces in which she lamented the emptiness of her\nlife when as must happen he left her, but they ended with a cry that all\nshe had to suffer would be worth it for the bliss that for a while had\nbeen hers. She wrote of the long, tremulous nights they passed together\nand the languor that lulled them to sleep in one another's arms. She\nwrote of the rapture of brief stolen moments when, braving all danger,\ntheir passion overwhelmed them and they surrendered to its call.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe thought it would be an affair of a few weeks, but miraculously it\nlasted. One of the poems referred to three years having gone by without\nlessening the love that filled their hearts. It looked as though he\ncontinued to press her to go away with him, far away, to a hill town in\nItaly, a Greek island, a walled city in Tunisia, so that they could be\ntogether always, for in another of the poems she besought him to let\nthings be as they were. Their happiness was precarious. Perhaps it was\nowing to the difficulties they had to encounter and the rarity of their\nmeetings that their love had retained for so long its first enchanting\nardour. Then on a sudden the young man died. How, when or where George\ncould not discover. There followed a long, heartbroken cry of bitter\ngrief, grief she could not indulge in, grief that had to be hidden. She\nhad to be cheerful, give dinner-parties and go out to dinner, behave as\nshe had always behaved, though the light had gone out of her life and\nshe was bowed down with anguish. The last poem of all was a set of four\nshort stanzas in which the writer, sadly resigned to her loss, thanked\nthe dark powers that rule man's destiny that she had been privileged at\nleast for a while to enjoy the greatest happiness that we poor human\nbeings can ever hope to know.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was three o'clock in the morning when George Peregrine finally put\nthe book down. It had seemed to him that he heard Evie's voice in every\nline, over and over again he came upon turns of phrase he had heard her\nuse, there were details that were as familiar to him as to her: there\nwas no doubt about it; it was her own story she had told, and it was as\nplain as anything could be that she had had a lover and her lover had\ndied. It was not anger so much that he felt, nor horror or dismay,\nthough he was dismayed and he was horrified, but amazement. It was as\ninconceivable that Evie should have had a love affair, and a wildly\npassionate one at that, as that the trout in a glass case over the\nchimney-piece in his study, the finest he had ever caught, should\nsuddenly wag its tail. He understood now the meaning of the amused look\nhe had seen in the eyes of that man he had spoken to at the club, he\nunderstood why Daphne when she was talking about the book had seemed to\nbe enjoying a private joke, and why those two women at the cocktail\nparty had tittered when he strolled past them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe broke out into a sweat. Then on a sudden he was seized with fury and\nhe jumped up to go and awake Evie and ask her sternly for an\nexplanation. But he stopped at the door. After all, what proof had he? A\nbook. He remembered that he'd told Evie he thought it jolly good. True,\nhe hadn't read it, but he'd pretended he had. He would look a perfect\nfool if he had to admit that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must watch my step,\" he muttered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe made up his mind to wait for two or three days and think it all over.\nThen he'd decide what to do. He went to bed, but he couldn't sleep for a\nlong time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Evie,\" he kept on saying to himself. \"Evie, of all people.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey met at breakfast next morning as usual. Evie was as she always was,\nquiet, demure and self-possessed, a middle-aged woman who made no effort\nto look younger than she was, a woman who had nothing of what he still\ncalled It. He looked at her as he hadn't looked at her for years. She\nhad her usual placid serenity. Her pale-blue eyes were untroubled. There\nwas no sign of guilt on her candid brow. She made the same little casual\nremarks she always made.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's nice to get back to the country again after those two hectic days\nin London. What are you going to do this morning?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was incomprehensible.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThree days later he went to see his solicitor. Henry Blane was an old\nfriend of George's as well as his lawyer. He had a place not far from\nPeregrine's and for years they had shot over one another's preserves.\nFor two days a week he was a country gentleman and for the other five a\nbusy lawyer in Sheffield. He was a tall, robust fellow, with a\nboisterous manner and a jovial laugh, which suggested that he liked to\nbe looked upon essentially as a sportsman and a good fellow and only\nincidentally as a lawyer. But he was shrewd and worldly-wise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, George, what's brought you here to-day?\" he boomed as the colonel\nwas shown into his office. \"Have a good time in London? I'm taking my\nmissus up for a few days next week. How's Evie?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's about Evie I've come to see you,\" said Peregrine, giving him a\nsuspicious look. \"Have you read her book?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis sensitivity had been sharpened during those last days of troubled\nthought and he was conscious of a faint change in the lawyer's\nexpression. It was as though he were suddenly on his guard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I've read it. Great success, isn't it? Fancy Evie breaking out\ninto poetry. Wonders will never cease.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Peregrine was inclined to lose his temper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's made me look a perfect damned fool.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, what nonsense, George! There's no harm in Evie's writing a book.\nYou ought to be jolly proud of her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't talk such rot. It's her own story. You know it and everyone else\nknows it. I suppose I'm the only one who doesn't know who her lover\nwas.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is such a thing as imagination, old boy. There's no reason to\nsuppose the whole thing isn't made up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, Henry, we've known one another all our lives. We've had all\nsorts of good times together. Be honest with me. Can you look me in the\nface and tell me you believe it's a made-up story?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHarry Blane moved uneasily in his chair. He was disturbed by the\ndistress in old George's voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got no right to ask me a question like that. Ask Evie.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I daren't,\" George answered after an anguished pause. \"I'm afraid she'd\ntell me the truth.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was an uncomfortable silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who was the chap?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHarry Blane looked at him straight in the eye.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know, and if I did I wouldn't tell you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You swine. Don't you see what a position I'm in? Do you think it's very\npleasant to be made absolutely ridiculous?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe lawyer lit a cigarette and for some moments silently puffed it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't see what I can do for you,\" he said at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got private detectives you employ, I suppose. I want you to put\nthem on the job and let them find everything out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not very pretty to put detectives on one's wife, old boy; and\nbesides, taking for granted for a moment that Evie had an affair, it was\na good many years ago and I don't suppose it would be possible to find\nout a thing. They seem to have covered their tracks pretty carefully.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't care. You put the detectives on. I want to know the truth.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I won't, George. If you're determined to do that you'd better consult\nsomeone else. And look here, even if you got evidence that Evie had been\nunfaithful to you what would you do with it? You'd look rather silly\ndivorcing your wife because she'd committed adultery ten years ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At all events I could have it out with her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can do that now, but you know just as well as I do that if you do\nshe'll leave you. D'you want her to do that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge gave him an unhappy look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. I always thought she'd been a damned good wife to me. She\nruns the house perfectly, we never have any servant trouble; she's done\nwonders with the garden and she's splendid with all the village people.\nBut damn it, I have my self-respect to think of. How can I go on living\nwith her when I know that she was grossly unfaithful to me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you always been faithful to her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"More or less, you know. After all, we've been married for nearly\ntwenty-four years and Evie was never much for bed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe solicitor slightly raised his eyebrows, but George was too intent on\nwhat he was saying to notice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't deny that I've had a bit of fun now and then. A man wants it.\nWomen are different.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We only have men's word for that,\" said Harry Blane, with a faint\nsmile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Evie's absolutely the last woman I'd have suspected of kicking over the\ntraces. I mean, she's a very fastidious, reticent woman. What on earth\nmade her write the damned book?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose it was a very poignant experience and perhaps it was a relief\nto her to get it off her chest like that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if she had to write it why the devil didn't she write it under an\nassumed name?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She used her maiden name. I suppose she thought that was enough, and it\nwould have been if the book hadn't had this amazing boom.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Peregrine and the lawyer were sitting opposite one another with a\ndesk between them. George, his elbow on the desk, his cheek on his hand,\nfrowned at his thought.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's so rotten not to know what sort of a chap he was. One can't even\ntell if he was by way of being a gentleman. I mean, for all I know he\nmay have been a farm-hand or a clerk in a lawyer's office.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHarry Blane did not permit himself to smile and when he answered there\nwas in his eyes a kindly, tolerant look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Knowing Evie so well I think the probabilities are that he was all\nright. Anyhow I'm sure he wasn't a clerk in my office.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's been a shock to me,\" the colonel sighed. \"I thought she was fond\nof me. She couldn't have written that book unless she hated me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I don't believe that. I don't think she's capable of hatred.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not going to pretend that she loves me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what does she feel for me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHarry Blane leaned back in his swivel chair and looked at George\nreflectively.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Indifference, I should say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe colonel gave a little shudder and reddened.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After all, you're not in love with her, are you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Peregrine did not answer directly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's been a great blow to me not to have any children, but I've never\nlet her see that I think she's let me down. I've always been kind to\nher. Within reasonable limits I've tried to do my duty by her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe lawyer passed a large hand over his mouth to conceal the smile that\ntrembled on his lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's been such an awful shock to me,\" Peregrine went on. \"Damn it all,\neven ten years ago Evie was no chicken and God knows, she wasn't much to\nlook at. It's so ugly.\" He sighed deeply. \"What would <i>you</i> do in my\nplace?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Peregrine drew himself bolt upright in his chair and he looked at\nHarry with the stern set face that he must have worn when he inspected\nhis regiment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't overlook a thing like this. I've been made a laughing-stock. I\ncan never hold up my head again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nonsense,\" said the lawyer sharply, and then in a pleasant, kindly\nmanner. \"Listen, old boy: the man's dead; it all happened a long while\nback. Forget it. Talk to people about Evie's book, rave about it, tell\n'em how proud you are of her. Behave as though you had so much\nconfidence in her, you <i>knew</i> she could never have been unfaithful to\nyou. The world moves so quickly and people's memories are so short.\nThey'll forget.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shan't forget.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're both middle-aged people. She probably does a great deal more for\nyou than you think and you'd be awfully lonely without her. I don't\nthink it matters if you don't forget. It'll be all to the good if you\ncan get it into that thick head of yours that there's a lot more in Evie\nthan you ever had the gumption to see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damn it all, you talk as if <i>I</i> was to blame.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I don't think you were to blame, but I'm not so sure that Evie was\neither. I don't suppose she wanted to fall in love with this boy. D'you\nremember those verses right at the end? The impression they gave me was\nthat though she was shattered by his death, in a strange sort of way she\nwelcomed it. All through she'd been aware of the fragility of the tie\nthat bound them. He died in the full flush of his first love and had\nnever known that love so seldom endures; he'd only known its bliss and\nbeauty. In her own bitter grief she found solace in the thought that\nhe'd been spared all sorrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All that's a bit above my head, old boy. I see more or less what you\nmean.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Peregrine stared unhappily at the inkstand on the desk. He was\nsilent and the lawyer looked at him with curious, yet sympathetic, eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you realise what courage she must have had never by a sign to show\nhow dreadfully unhappy she was?\" he said gently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nColonel Peregrine sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm broken. I suppose you're right; it's no good crying over spilt milk\nand it would only make things worse if I made a fuss.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Peregrine gave a pitiful little smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll take your advice. I'll do nothing. Let them think me a damned fool\nand to hell with them. The truth is, I don't know what I'd do without\nEvie. But I'll tell you what, there's one thing I shall never understand\ntill my dying day: What in the name of heaven did the fellow ever see in\nher?\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nIt was not till the beginning of September that Ashenden, a writer by\nprofession, who had been abroad at the outbreak of the war, managed to\nget back to England. He chanced soon after his arrival to go to a party\nand was there introduced to a middle-aged colonel whose name he did not\ncatch. He had some talk with him. As he was about to leave, this officer\ncame up to him and asked:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, I wonder if you'd mind coming to see me. I'd rather like to have\na chat with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Certainly,\" said Ashenden. \"Whenever you like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What about to-morrow at eleven?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll just write down my address. Have you a card on you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden gave him one and on this the colonel scribbled in pencil the\nname of a street and the number of a house. When Ashenden walked along\nnext morning to keep his appointment he found himself in a street of\nrather vulgar red-brick houses in a part of London that had once been\nfashionable, but was now fallen in the esteem of the house-hunter who\nwanted a good address. On the house at which Ashenden had been asked to\ncall there was a board up to announce that it was for sale, the shutters\nwere closed and there was no sign that anyone lived in it. He rang the\nbell and the door was opened by a non-commissioned officer so promptly\nthat he was startled. He was not asked his business, but led immediately\ninto a long room at the back, once evidently a dining-room, the florid\ndecoration of which looked oddly out of keeping with the office\nfurniture, shabby and sparse, that was in it. It gave Ashenden the\nimpression of a room in which the brokers had taken possession. The\ncolonel, who was known in the Intelligence Department, as Ashenden later\ndiscovered, by the letter R., rose when he came in and shook hands with\nhim. He was a man somewhat above the middle height, lean, with a yellow,\ndeeply-lined face, thin grey hair and a toothbrush moustache. The thing\nimmediately noticeable about him was the closeness with which his blue\neyes were set. He only just escaped a squint. They were hard and cruel\neyes, and very wary; and they gave him a cunning, shifty look. Here was\na man that you could neither like nor trust at first sight. His manner\nwas pleasant and cordial.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe asked Ashenden a good many questions and then, without further to-do,\nsuggested that he had particular qualifications for the secret service.\nAshenden was acquainted with several European languages and his\nprofession was excellent cover; on the pretext that he was writing a\nbook he could without attracting attention visit any neutral country. It\nwas while they were discussing this point that R. said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, you ought to get material that would be very useful to you in\nyour work.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shouldn't mind that,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll tell you an incident that occurred only the other day and I can\nvouch for its truth. I thought at the time it would make a damned good\nstory. One of the French ministers went down to Nice to recover from a\ncold and he had some very important documents with him that he kept in a\ndespatch-case. They were very important indeed. Well, a day or two after\nhe arrived he picked up a yellow-haired lady at some restaurant or other\nwhere there was dancing, and he got very friendly with her. To cut a\nlong story short, he took her back to his hotel--of course it was a very\nimprudent thing to do--and when he came to himself in the morning the\nlady and the despatch-case had disappeared. They had one or two drinks\nup in his room and his theory is that when his back was turned the woman\nslipped a drug into his glass.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. finished and looked at Ashenden with a gleam in his close-set eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dramatic, isn't it?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean to say that happened the other day?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The week before last.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Impossible,\" cried Ashenden. \"Why, we've been putting that incident on\nthe stage for sixty years, we've written it in a thousand novels. Do you\nmean to say that life has only just caught up with us?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. was a trifle disconcerted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if necessary, I could give you names and dates, and believe me,\nthe Allies have been put to no end of trouble by the loss of the\ndocuments that the despatch-case contained.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, sir, if you can't do better than that in the secret service,\"\nsighed Ashenden, \"I'm afraid that as a source of inspiration to the\nwriter of fiction it's a wash-out. We really <i>can't</i> write that story\nmuch longer.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt did not take them long to settle things and when Ashenden rose to go\nhe had already made careful note of his instructions. He was to start\nfor Geneva next day. The last words that R. said to him, with a\ncasualness that made them impressive, were:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's just one thing I think you ought to know before you take on\nthis job. And don't forget it. If you do well you'll get no thanks and\nif you get into trouble you'll get no help. Does that suit you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perfectly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then I'll wish you good-afternoon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was on his way back to Geneva. The night was stormy and the\nwind blew cold from the mountains, but the stodgy little steamer plodded\nsturdily through the choppy waters of the lake. A scudding rain, just\nturning into sleet, swept the deck in angry gusts, like a nagging woman\nwho cannot leave a subject alone. Ashenden had been to France in order\nto write and dispatch a report. A day or two before, about five in the\nafternoon, an Indian agent of his had come to see him in his rooms; it\nwas only by a lucky chance that he was in, for he had no appointment\nwith him, and the agent's instructions were to come to the hotel only in\na case of urgent importance. He told Ashenden that a Bengali in the\nGerman service had recently come from Berlin with a black cane trunk in\nwhich were a number of documents interesting to the British Government.\nAt that time the Central Powers were doing their best to foment such an\nagitation in India as would make it necessary for Great Britain to keep\ntheir troops in the country and perhaps send others from France. It had\nbeen found possible to get the Bengali arrested in Berne on a charge\nthat would keep him out of harm's way for a while, but the black cane\ntrunk could not be found. Ashenden's agent was a very brave and very\nclever fellow and he mixed freely with such of his countrymen as were\ndisaffected to the interests of Great Britain. He had just discovered\nthat the Bengali before going to Berne had, for greater safety, left the\ntrunk in the cloakroom at Zürich station, and now that he was in gaol,\nawaiting trial, was unable to get the <i>bulletin</i> by which it might be\nobtained into the hands of any of his confederates. It was a matter of\ngreat urgency for the German Intelligence Department to secure the\ncontents of the trunk without delay, and since it was impossible for\nthem to get hold of it by the ordinary official means, they had decided\nto break into the station that very night and steal it. It was a bold\nand ingenious scheme and Ashenden felt a pleasant exhilaration (for a\ngreat deal of his work was uncommonly dull) when he heard of it. He\nrecognised the dashing and unscrupulous touch of the head of the German\nsecret service at Berne. But the burglary was arranged for two o'clock\non the following morning and there was not a moment to lose. He could\ntrust neither the telegraph nor the telephone to communicate with the\nBritish officer at Berne, and since the Indian agent could not go (he\nwas taking his life in his hands by coming to see Ashenden and if he\nwere noticed leaving his room it might easily be that he would be found\none day floating in the lake with a knife thrust in his back), there was\nnothing for it but to go himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a train to Berne that he could just catch and he put on his\nhat and coat as he ran downstairs. He jumped into a cab. Four hours\nlater he rang the bell of the headquarters of the Intelligence\nDepartment. His name was known there but to one person, and it was for\nhim that Ashenden asked. A tall tired-looking man, whom he had not met\nbefore, came out and without a word led him into an office. Ashenden\ntold him his errand. The tall man looked at his watch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's too late for us to do anything ourselves. We couldn't possibly get\nto Zürich in time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe reflected.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'll put the Swiss authorities on the job. They can telephone, and\nwhen your friends attempt their little burglary, I have no doubt they'll\nfind the station well guarded. Anyhow, you had better get back to\nGeneva.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe shook hands with Ashenden and showed him out. Ashenden was well aware\nthat he would never know what happened then. Being no more than a tiny\nrivet in a vast and complicated machine, he never had the advantage of\nseeing a completed action. He was concerned with the beginning or the\nend of it, perhaps, or with some incident in the middle, but what his\nown doings led to he had seldom a chance of discovering. It was as\nunsatisfactory as those modern novels that give you a number of\nunrelated episodes and expect you by piecing them together to construct\nin your mind a connected narrative.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNotwithstanding his fur coat and his muffler, Ashenden was chilled to\nthe bone. It was warm in the saloon and there were good lights to read\nby, but he thought it better not to sit there in case some habitual\ntraveller, recognising him, wondered why he made these constant journeys\nbetween Geneva in Switzerland and Thonon in France; and so, making the\nbest of what shelter could be found, he passed the tedious time in the\ndarkness of the deck. He looked in the direction of Geneva, but could\nsee no lights, and the sleet, turning into snow, prevented him from\nrecognising the landmarks. Lake Leman, on fine days so trim and pretty,\nartificial like a piece of water in a French garden, in this tempestuous\nweather was as secret and as menacing as the sea. He made up his mind\nthat, on getting back to his hotel, he would have a fire lit in his\nsitting-room, a hot bath, and dinner comfortably by the fireside in\npyjamas and a dressing-gown. The prospect of spending an evening by\nhimself with his pipe and a book was so agreeable that it made the\nmisery of that journey across the lake positively worth while. Two\nsailors tramped past him heavily, their heads bent down to save\nthemselves from the sleet that blew in their faces, and one of them\nshouted to him: <i>Nous arrivons</i>; they went to the side and withdrew a\nbar to allow passage for the gangway, and looking again Ashenden through\nthe howling darkness saw mistily the lights of the quay. A welcome\nsight. In two or three minutes the steamer was made fast and Ashenden,\nmuffled to the eyes, joined himself to the little knot of passengers\nthat waited to step ashore. Though he made the journey so often--it was\nhis duty to cross the lake into France once a week to deliver his\nreports and to receive instructions--he had always a faint sense of\ntrepidation when he stood among the crowd at the gangway and waited to\nland. There was nothing on his passport to show that he had been in\nFrance; the steamer went round the lake touching French soil at two\nplaces, but going from Switzerland to Switzerland, so that his journey\nmight have been to Vevey or to Lausanne; but he could never be sure that\nthe secret police had not taken note of him, and if he had been followed\nand seen to land in France, the fact that there was no stamp on his\npassport would be difficult to explain. Of course he had his story\nready, but he well knew that it was not a very convincing one, and\nthough it might be impossible for the Swiss authorities to prove that he\nwas anything but a casual traveller, he might nevertheless spend two or\nthree days in gaol, which would be uncomfortable, and then be firmly\nconducted to the frontier, which would be mortifying. The Swiss knew\nwell that their country was the scene of all manner of intrigues; agents\nof the secret service, spies, revolutionaries and agitators infested the\nhotels of the principal towns and, jealous of their neutrality, they\nwere determined to prevent conduct that might embroil them with any of\nthe belligerent powers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere were as usual two police officers on the quay to watch the\npassengers disembark and Ashenden, walking past them with as unconcerned\nan air as he could assume, was relieved when he had got safely by. The\ndarkness swallowed him up and he stepped out briskly for his hotel. The\nwild weather with a scornful gesture had swept all the neatness from the\ntrim promenade. The shops were closed and Ashenden passed only an\noccasional pedestrian who sidled along, scrunched up, as though he fled\nfrom the blind wrath of the unknown. You had a feeling in that black and\nbitter night that civilisation, ashamed of its artificiality, cowered\nbefore the fury of elemental things. It was hail now that blew in\nAshenden's face and the pavement was wet and slippery so that he had to\nwalk with caution. The hotel faced the lake. When he reached it and a\npage-boy opened the door for him, he entered the hall with a flurry of\nwind that sent the papers on the porter's desk flying into the air.\nAshenden was dazzled by the light. He stopped to ask the porter if there\nwere letters for him. There was nothing, and he was about to get into\nthe lift when the porter told him that two gentlemen were waiting in his\nroom to see him. Ashenden had no friends in Geneva.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh?\" he answered, not a little surprised. \"Who are they?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had taken care to get on friendly terms with the porter and his tips\nfor trifling services had been generous. The porter gave a discreet\nsmile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is no harm in telling you. I think they are members of the\npolice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do they want?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They did not say. They asked me where you were, and I told them you had\ngone for a walk. They said they would wait till you came back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How long have they been there?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"An hour.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden's heart sank, but he took care not to let his face betray his\nconcern.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll go up and see them,\" he said. The liftman stood aside to let him\nstep into the lift, but Ashenden shook his head. \"I'm so cold,\" he said,\n\"I'll walk up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe wished to give himself a moment to think, but as he ascended the\nthree flights slowly his feet were like lead. There could be small doubt\nwhy two police officers were so bent upon seeing him. He felt on a\nsudden dreadfully tired. He did not feel he could cope with a multitude\nof questions. And if he were arrested as a secret agent he must spend at\nleast the night in a cell. He longed more than ever for a hot bath and a\npleasant dinner by his fireside. He had half a mind to turn tail and\nwalk out of the hotel, leaving everything behind him; he had his\npassport in his pocket and he knew by heart the hours at which trains\nstarted for the frontier: before the Swiss authorities had made up their\nminds what to do he would be in safety. But he continued to trudge\nupstairs. He did not like the notion of abandoning his job so easily; he\nhad been sent to Geneva, knowing the risks, to do work of a certain\nkind, and it seemed to him that he had better go through with it. Of\ncourse it would not be very nice to spend two years in a Swiss prison,\nbut the chance of this was, like assassination to kings, one of the\ninconveniences of his profession. He reached the landing of the third\nfloor and walked to his room. Ashenden had in him, it seems, a strain of\nflippancy (on account of which, indeed, the critics had often reproached\nhim) and as he stood for a moment outside the door his predicament\nappeared to him on a sudden rather droll. His spirits went up and he\ndetermined to brazen the thing out. It was with a genuine smile on his\nlips that he turned the handle and entering the room faced his visitors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-evening, gentlemen,\" said he.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe room was brightly lit, for all the lights were on, and a fire burned\nin the hearth. The air was grey with smoke, since the strangers, finding\nit long to wait for him, had been smoking strong and inexpensive cigars.\nThey sat in their greatcoats and bowler-hats as though they had only\njust that moment come in; but the ashes in the little tray on the table\nwould alone have suggested that they had been long enough there to make\nthemselves familiar with their surroundings. They were two powerful men,\nwith black moustaches, on the stout side, heavily built, and they\nreminded Ashenden of Fafner and Fasolt, the giants in <i>The Rhinegold</i>;\ntheir clumsy boots, the massive way they sat in their chairs and the\nponderous alertness of their expression made it obvious that they were\nmembers of the detective force. Ashenden gave his room an enveloping\nglance. He was a neat creature and saw at once that his things, though\nnot in disorder, were not as he had left them. He guessed that an\nexamination had been made of his effects. That did not disturb him, for\nhe kept in his room no document that would compromise him; his code he\nhad learned by heart and destroyed before leaving England, and such\ncommunications as reached him from Germany were handed to him by third\nparties and transmitted without delay to the proper places. There was\nnothing he need fear in a search, but the impression that it had been\nmade confirmed his suspicion that he had been denounced to the\nauthorities as a secret agent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What can I do for you, gentlemen?\" he asked affably. \"It's warm in\nhere, wouldn't you like to take off your coats--and hats?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt faintly irritated him that they should sit there with their hats on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We're only staying a minute,\" said one of them. \"We were passing and as\nthe <i>concierge</i> said you would be in at once, we thought we would wait.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not remove his hat. Ashenden unwrapped his scarf and\ndisembarrassed himself of his heavy coat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Won't you have a cigar?\" he asked, offering the box to the two\ndetectives in turn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't mind if I do,\" said the first, Fafner, taking one, upon which\nthe second, Fasolt, helped himself without a word, even of thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe name on the box appeared to have a singular effect on their manners,\nfor both now took off their hats.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must have had a very disagreeable walk in this bad weather,\" said\nFafner, as he bit half an inch off the end of his cigar and spat it in\nthe fireplace.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow it was Ashenden's principle (a good one in life as well as in the\nIntelligence Department) always to tell as much of the truth as he\nconveniently could; so he answered as follows:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you take me for? I wouldn't go out in such weather if I could\nhelp it. I had to go to Vevey to-day to see an invalid friend and I came\nback by boat. It was bitter on the lake.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We come from the police,\" said Fafner casually.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden thought they must consider him a perfect idiot if they imagined\nhe had not guessed that, but it was not a piece of information to which\nit was discreet to reply with a pleasantry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, really,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you your passport on you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. In these war-times I think a foreigner is wise always to keep his\npassport on him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very wise.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden handed the man the nice new passport, which gave no information\nabout his movements other than that he had come from London three months\nbefore and had since then crossed no frontier. The detective looked at\nit carefully and passed it on to his colleague.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It appears to be all in order,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden, standing in front of the fire to warm himself, a cigarette\nbetween his lips, made no reply. He watched the detectives warily, but\nwith an expression, he flattered himself, of amiable unconcern. Fasolt\nhanded back the passport to Fafner, who tapped it reflectively with a\nthick forefinger.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The chief of police told us to come here,\" he said, and Ashenden was\nconscious that both of them now looked at him with attention, \"to make a\nfew enquiries of you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden knew that when you have nothing apposite to say it is better to\nhold your tongue; and when a man has made a remark that calls to his\nmind for an answer, he is apt to find silence a trifle disconcerting.\nAshenden waited for the detective to proceed. He was not quite sure, but\nit seemed to him that he hesitated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It appears that there have been a good many complaints lately of the\nnoise that people make when they come out of the Casino late at night.\nWe wish to know if you personally have been troubled by the disturbance.\nIt is evident that as your rooms look on the lake and the revellers pass\nyour windows, if the noise is serious, you must have heard it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor an instant Ashenden was dumbfounded. What balderdash was this the\ndetective was talking to him (boom, boom, he heard the big drum as the\ngiant lumbered on the scene), and why on earth should the chief of\npolice send to him to find out if his beauty sleep had been disturbed by\nvociferous gamblers? It looked very like a trap. But nothing is so\nfoolish as to ascribe profundity to what on the surface is merely inept;\nit is a pitfall into which many an ingenuous reviewer has fallen\nheadlong. Ashenden had a confident belief in the stupidity of the human\nanimal, which in the course of his life had stood him in good stead. It\nflashed across him that if the detective asked him such a question it\nwas because he had no shadow of proof that he was engaged in any illegal\npractice. It was clear that he had been denounced, but no evidence had\nbeen offered, and the search of his rooms had been fruitless. But what a\nsilly excuse was this to make for a visit and what a poverty of\ninvention it showed! Ashenden immediately thought of three reasons the\ndetectives might have given for seeking an interview with him and he\nwished that he were on terms sufficiently familiar with them to make the\nsuggestions. This was really an insult to the intelligence. These men\nwere even stupider than he thought; but Ashenden had always a soft\ncorner in his heart for the stupid and now he looked upon them with a\nfeeling of unexpected kindliness. He would have liked to pat them\ngently. But he answered the question with gravity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To tell you the truth, I am a very sound sleeper (the result doubtless\nof a pure heart and an easy conscience), and I have never heard a\nthing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden looked at them for the faint smile that he thought his remark\ndeserved, but their countenances remained stolid. Ashenden, as well as\nan agent of the British Government, was a humorist, and he stifled the\nbeginnings of a sigh. He assumed a slightly imposing air and adopted a\nmore serious tone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But even if I had been awakened by noisy people I should not dream of\ncomplaining. At a time when there is so much trouble, misery and\nunhappiness in the world, I cannot but think it very wrong to disturb\nthe amusement of persons who are lucky enough to be able to amuse\nthemselves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>En effet</i>,\" said the detective. \"But the fact remains that people have\nbeen disturbed and the chief of police thought the matter should be\nenquired into.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis colleague, who had hitherto preserved a silence that was positively\nsphinx-like, now broke it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I notice by your passport that you are an author, <i>monsieur</i>,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden in reaction from his previous perturbation was feeling\nexceedingly debonair and he answered with good-humour:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is true. It is a profession full of tribulation, but it has now and\nthen its compensations.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>La gloire</i>,\" said Fafner politely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Or shall we say notoriety?\" hazarded Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what are you doing in Geneva?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe question was put so pleasantly that Ashenden felt it behoved him to\nbe on his guard. A police officer amiable is more dangerous to the wise\nthan a police officer aggressive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am writing a play,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe waved his hand to the papers on his table. Four eyes followed his\ngesture. A casual glance told him that the detectives had looked and\ntaken note of his manuscripts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And why should you write a play here rather than in your own country?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden smiled upon them with even more affability than before, since\nthis was a question for which he had long been prepared, and it was a\nrelief to give the answer. He was curious to see how it would go down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Mais, monsieur</i>, there is the war. My country is in turmoil, it would\nbe impossible to sit there quietly and write a play.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it a comedy or a tragedy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, a comedy, and a light one at that,\" replied Ashenden. \"The artist\nneeds peace and quietness. How do you expect him to preserve that\ndetachment of spirit that is demanded by creative work unless he can\nhave perfect tranquillity? Switzerland has the good fortune to be\nneutral, and it seemed to me that in Geneva I should find the very\nsurroundings I wanted.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFafner nodded slight to Fasolt, but whether to indicate that he thought\nAshenden an imbecile or whether in sympathy with his desire for a safe\nretreat from a turbulent world, Ashenden had no means of knowing. Anyhow\nthe detective evidently came to the conclusion that he could learn\nnothing more from talking to Ashenden, for his remarks grew now\ndesultory and in a few minutes he rose to go.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ashenden, having warmly shaken their hands, closed the door behind\nthe pair he heaved a great sigh of relief. He turned on the water for\nhis bath, as hot as he thought he could possibly bear it, and as he\nundressed reflected comfortably over his escape.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe day before, an incident had occurred that had left him on his guard.\nThere was in his service a Swiss, known in the Intelligence Department\nas Bernard, who had recently come from Germany, and Ashenden, desiring\nto see him, had instructed him to go to a certain café at a certain\ntime. Since he had not seen him before, so that there might be no\nmistake he had informed him through an intermediary what question\nhimself would ask and what reply he was to give. He chose the luncheon\nhour for the meeting, since then the café was unlikely to be crowded,\nand it chanced that on entering he saw but one man of about the age he\nknew Bernard to be. He was by himself, and going up to him Ashenden\ncasually put to him the pre-arranged question. The pre-arranged answer\nwas given, and sitting down beside him, Ashenden ordered himself a\nDubonnet. The spy was a stocky little fellow, shabbily dressed, with a\nbullet-shaped head, close-cropped, fair, with shifty blue eyes and a\nsallow skin. He did not inspire confidence, and but that Ashenden knew\nby experience how hard it was to find men willing to go into Germany he\nwould have been surprised that his predecessor had engaged him. He was a\nGerman-Swiss and spoke French with a strong accent. He immediately asked\nfor his wages and these Ashenden passed over to him in an envelope. They\nwere in Swiss francs. He gave a general account of his stay in Germany\nand answered Ashenden's careful questions. He was by calling a waiter\nand had found a job in a restaurant near one of the Rhine bridges, which\ngave him good opportunity to get the information that was required of\nhim. His reasons for coming to Switzerland for a few days were plausible\nand there could apparently be no difficulty in his crossing the frontier\non his return. Ashenden expressed his satisfaction with his behaviour,\ngave him his orders and was prepared to finish the interview.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very good,\" said Bernard. \"But before I go back to Germany I want two\nthousand francs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, and I want them now, before you leave this café. It's a sum I have\nto pay, and I've got to have it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I can't give it to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA scowl made the man's face even more unpleasant to look at than it was\nbefore.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What makes you think that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe spy leaned forward and, not raising his voice, but speaking so that\nonly Ashenden could hear, burst out angrily:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think I'm going on risking my life for that beggarly sum you\ngive me? Not ten days ago a man was caught at Mainz and shot. Was that\none of your men?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We haven't got anyone at Mainz,\" said Ashenden, carelessly, and for all\nhe knew it was true. He had been puzzled not to receive his usual\ncommunications from that place and Bernard's information might afford\nthe explanation. \"You knew exactly what you were to get when you took on\nthe job, and if you weren't satisfied you needn't have taken it. I have\nno authority to give you a penny more.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you see what I've got here?\" said Bernard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took a small revolver out of his pocket and fingered it\nsignificantly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do with it? Pawn it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith an angry shrug of the shoulders he put it back in his pocket.\nAshenden reflected that had he known anything of the technique of the\ntheatre Bernard would have been aware that it was useless to make a\ngesture that had no ulterior meaning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You refuse to give me the money?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Certainly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe spy's manner, which at first had been obsequious, was now somewhat\ntruculent, but he kept his head and never for a moment raised his voice.\nAshenden could see that Bernard, however big a ruffian, was a reliable\nagent, and he made up his mind to suggest to R. that his salary should\nbe raised. The scene diverted him. A little way off two fat citizens of\nGeneva, with black beards, were playing dominoes, and on the other side\na young man with spectacles was with great rapidity writing sheet after\nsheet of an immensely long letter. A Swiss family (who knows, perhaps\nRobinson by name), consisting of a father and mother and four children,\nwere sitting round a table making the best of two small cups of coffee.\nThe <i>caissière</i> behind the counter, an imposing brunette with a large\nbust encased in black silk, was reading the local paper. The\nsurroundings made the melodramatic scene in which Ashenden was engaged\nperfectly grotesque. His own play seemed to him much more real.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBernard smiled. His smile was not engaging.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you know that I have only to go to the police and tell them about\nyou to have you arrested? Do you know what a Swiss prison is like?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I've often wondered lately. Do you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, and you wouldn't much like it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne of the things that had bothered Ashenden was the possibility that he\nwould be arrested before he finished his play. He disliked the notion of\nleaving it half done for an indefinite period. He did not know whether\nhe would be treated as a political prisoner or as a common criminal and\nhe had a mind to ask Bernard whether in the latter case (the only one\nBernard was likely to know anything about) he would be allowed writing\nmaterials. He was afraid Bernard would think the inquiry an attempt to\nlaugh at him. But he was feeling comparatively at ease and was able to\nanswer Bernard's threat without heat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You could of course get me sentenced to two years' imprisonment.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At least.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, that is the maximum, I understand, and I think it is quite enough.\nI won't conceal from you that I should find it extremely disagreeable.\nBut not nearly so disagreeable as you would.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What could you do?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, we'd get you somehow. And after all, the war won't last for ever.\nYou are a waiter, you want your freedom of action. I promise you that if\nI get into any trouble, you will never be admitted into any of the\nAllied countries for the rest of your life. I can't help thinking it\nwould cramp your style.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBernard did not reply, but looked down sulkily at the marble-topped\ntable. Ashenden thought this was the moment to pay for the drinks and\ngo.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Think it over, Bernard,\" he said. \"If you want to go back to your job,\nyou have your instructions, and your usual wages shall be paid through\nthe usual channels.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe spy shrugged his shoulders, and Ashenden, though not knowing in the\nleast what was the result of their conversation, felt that it behoved\nhim to walk out with dignity. He did so.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd now as he carefully put one foot into the bath, wondering if he\ncould bear it, he asked himself what Bernard had in the end decided on.\nThe water was just not scalding and he gradually let himself down into\nit. On the whole it seemed to him that the spy had thought it would be\nas well to go straight, and the source of his denunciation must be\nlooked for elsewhere. Perhaps in the hotel itself. Ashenden lay back,\nand as his body grew used to the heat of the water gave a sigh of\nsatisfaction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Really,\" he reflected, \"there are moments in life when all this to-do\nthat has led from the primeval slime to myself seems almost worth\nwhile.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden could not but think he was lucky to have wriggled out of the\nfix he had found himself in that afternoon. Had he been arrested and in\ndue course sentenced, R., shrugging his shoulders, would merely have\ncalled him a damned fool and set about looking for someone to take his\nplace. Already Ashenden knew his chief well enough to be aware that when\nhe had told him that if he got into trouble he need look for no help he\nmeant exactly what he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden, lying comfortably in his bath, was glad to think that in all\nprobability he would be able to finish his play in peace. The police had\ndrawn a blank and though they might watch him from now on with some care\nit was unlikely that they would take a further step until he had at\nleast roughed out his third act. It behoved him to be prudent (only a\nfortnight ago his colleague at Lausanne had been sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment), but it would be foolish to be alarmed: his predecessor in\nGeneva, seeing himself, with an exaggerated sense of his own importance,\nshadowed from morning till night, had been so affected by the nervous\nstrain that it had been found necessary to withdraw him. Twice a week\nAshenden had to go to the market to receive instructions that were\nbrought to him by an old peasant woman from French Savoy who sold butter\nand eggs. She came in with the other market-women and the search at the\nfrontier was perfunctory. It was barely dawn when they crossed and the\nofficials were only too glad to have done quickly with these chattering\nnoisy women and get back to their warm fires and their cigars. Indeed\nthis old lady looked so bland and innocent, with her corpulence, her fat\nred face, and her smiling good-natured mouth, it would have been a very\nastute detective who could imagine that if he took the trouble to put\nhis hand deep down between those voluminous breasts of hers, he would\nfind a little piece of paper that would land in the dock an honest old\nwoman (who kept her son out of the trenches by taking this risk) and an\nEnglish writer approaching middle age. Ashenden went to the market about\nnine when the housewives of Geneva for the most part had done their\nprovisioning, stopped in front of the basket by the side of which, rain\nor wind, hot or cold, sat that indomitable creature and bought half a\npound of butter. She slipped the note into his hand when he was given\nchange for ten francs and he sauntered away. His only moment of risk was\nwhen he walked back to his hotel with the paper in his pocket, and after\nthis scare he made up his mind to shorten as much as possible the period\nduring which it could be found on him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden sighed, for the water was no longer quite so hot; he could not\nreach the tap with his hand nor could he turn it with his toes (as every\nproperly regulated tap should turn) and if he got up enough to add more\nhot-water he might just as well get out altogether. On the other hand he\ncould not pull out the plug with his foot in order to empty the bath and\nso force himself to get out, nor could he find in himself the will-power\nto step out of it like a man. He had often heard people tell him that he\npossessed character and he reflected that people judge hastily in the\naffairs of life because they judge on insufficient evidence: they had\nnever seen him in a hot, but diminishingly hot, bath. His mind, however,\nwandered back to his play, and telling himself jokes and repartees that\nhe knew by bitter experience would never look so neat on paper nor sound\nso well on the stage as they did then, he abstracted his mind from the\nfact that his bath was growing almost tepid, when he heard a knock at\nthe door. Since he did not want anyone to enter, he had the presence of\nmind not to say come in, but the knocking was repeated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is it?\" he cried irascibly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A letter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come in then. Wait a minute.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden heard his bedroom-door open and getting out of the bath flung a\ntowel round him and went in. A page-boy was waiting with a note. It\nneeded only a verbal answer. It was from a lady staying in the hotel\nasking him to play bridge after dinner and was signed in the continental\nfashion Baronne de Higgins. Ashenden, longing for a cosy meal in his own\nroom, in slippers and with a book leaned up against a reading-lamp, was\nabout to refuse when it occurred to him that in the circumstances it\nmight be discreet to show himself in the dining-room that night. It was\nabsurd to suppose that in that hotel the news would not have spread that\nhe had been visited by the police and it would be as well to prove to\nhis fellow-guests that he was not disconcerted. It had passed through\nhis mind that it might be someone in the hotel who had denounced him and\nindeed the name of the sprightly baroness had not failed to suggest\nitself to him. If it was she who had given him away there would be a\ncertain humour in playing bridge with her. He gave the boy a message\nthat he would be pleased to come and proceeded slowly to don his evening\nclothes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Baroness von Higgins was an Austrian, who on settling in Geneva\nduring the first winter of the war had found it convenient to make her\nname look as French as possible. She spoke English and French perfectly.\nHer surname, so far from Teutonic, she owed to her grandfather, a\nYorkshire stable-boy, who had been taken over to Austria by a Prince\nBlankenstein early in the nineteenth century. He had had a charming and\nromantic career; a very good-looking man, he attracted the attention of\none of the arch-duchesses and then made such good use of his\nopportunities that he ended his life as a baron and minister\nplenipotentiary to an Italian court. The baroness, his only descendant,\nafter an unhappy marriage, the particulars of which she was fond of\nrelating to her acquaintance, had resumed her maiden name. She mentioned\nnot infrequently the fact that her grandfather had been an ambassador,\nbut never that he had been a stable-boy and Ashenden had learned this\ninteresting detail from Vienna; for as he grew friendly with her he had\nthought it necessary to get a few particulars about her past, and he\nknew among other things that her private income did not permit her to\nlive on the somewhat lavish scale on which she was living in Geneva.\nSince she had so many advantages for espionage, it was fairly safe to\nsuppose that an alert secret service had enlisted her services and\nAshenden took it for granted that she was engaged somehow on the same\nkind of work as himself. It increased if anything the cordiality of his\nrelations with her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen he went into the dining-room it was already full. He sat down at\nhis table and feeling jaunty after his adventure ordered himself (at the\nexpense of the British Government) a bottle of champagne. The baroness\ngave him a flashing, brilliant smile. She was a woman of more than\nforty, but in a hard and glittering manner extremely beautiful. She was\na high-coloured blonde with golden hair of a metallic lustre, lovely no\ndoubt but not attractive, and Ashenden had from the first reflected that\nit was not the sort of hair you would like to find in your soup. She had\nfine features, blue eyes, a straight nose, and a pink and white skin,\nbut her skin was stretched over her bones a trifle tightly; she was\ngenerously <i>décolletée</i> and her white and ample bosom had the quality of\nmarble. There was nothing in her appearance to suggest the yielding\ntenderness that the susceptible find so alluring. She was magnificently\ngowned, but scantily bejewelled, so that Ashenden, who knew something of\nthese matters, concluded that the superior authority had given her\n<i>carte blanche</i> at a dressmaker's but had not thought it prudent or\nnecessary to provide her with rings or pearls. She was notwithstanding\nso showy that but for R.'s story of the minister, Ashenden would have\nthought the sight of her alone must have aroused in anyone on whom she\ndesired to exercise her wiles the sense of prudence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhile he waited for his dinner to be served, Ashenden cast his eyes over\nthe company. Most of the persons gathered were old friends by sight. At\nthat time Geneva was a hot-bed of intrigue and its home was the hotel at\nwhich Ashenden was staying. There were Frenchmen there, Italians and\nRussians, Turks, Rumanians, Greeks and Egyptians. Some had fled their\ncountry, some doubtless represented it. There was a Bulgarian, an agent\nof Ashenden's, whom for greater safety he had never even spoken to in\nGeneva; he was dining that night with two fellow-countrymen and in a day\nor so, if he was not killed in the interval, might have a very\ninteresting communication to make. Then there was a little German\nprostitute, with china-blue eyes and a doll-like face, who made frequent\njourneys along the lake and up to Berne, and in the exercise of her\nprofession got little titbits of information over which doubtless they\npondered with deliberation in Berlin. She was of course of a different\nclass from the baroness and hunted much easier game. But Ashenden was\nsurprised to catch sight of Count von Holzminden and wondered what on\nearth he was doing there. This was the German agent in Vevey and he came\nover to Geneva only on occasion. Once Ashenden had seen him in the old\nquarter of the city, with its silent houses and deserted streets,\ntalking at a corner to a man whose appearance very much suggested the\nspy and he would have given a great deal to hear what they said to one\nanother. It had amused him to come across the Count, for in London\nbefore the war he had known him fairly well. He was of great family and\nindeed related to the Hohenzollerns. He was fond of England; he danced\nwell, rode well and shot well; people said he was more English than the\nEnglish. He was a tall, thin fellow, in well-cut clothes, with a\nclose-cropped Prussian head, and that peculiar bend of the body as\nthough he were just about to bow to a royalty that you feel, rather than\nsee, in those who have spent their lives about a court. He had charming\nmanners and was much interested in the Fine Arts. But now Ashenden and\nhe pretended they had never seen one another before. Each of course knew\non what work the other was engaged and Ashenden had had a mind to chaff\nhim about it--it seemed absurd when he had dined with a man off and on\nfor years and played cards with him, to act as though he did not know\nhim from Adam--but refrained in case the German looked upon his\nbehaviour as further proof of the British frivolity in face of war.\nAshenden was perplexed: Holzminden had never set foot in that hotel\nbefore and it was unlikely that he had done so now without good reason.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden asked himself whether this event had anything to do with the\nunusual presence in the dining-room of Prince Ali. At that juncture it\nwas imprudent to ascribe any occurrence, however accidental it looked,\nto the hazard of coincidence. Prince Ali was an Egyptian, a near\nrelation of the Khedive, who had fled his country when the Khedive was\ndeposed. He was a bitter enemy of the English and was known to be\nactively engaged in stirring up trouble in Egypt. The week before, the\nKhedive in great secrecy had passed three days at the hotel and the pair\nof them had held constant meetings in the prince's apartments. He was a\nlittle fat man with a heavy black moustache. He was living with his two\ndaughters and a certain pasha, Mustapha by name, who was his secretary\nand managed his affairs. The four of them were now dining together; they\ndrank a great deal of champagne, but sat in a stolid silence. The two\nprincesses were emancipated young women who spent their nights dancing\nin restaurants with the bloods of Geneva. They were short and stout,\nwith fine black eyes and heavy sallow faces; and they were dressed with\na rich loudness that suggested the Fish-market at Cairo rather than the\nRue de la Paix. His Highness usually ate upstairs but the princesses\ndined every evening in the public dining-room: they were chaperoned\nvaguely by a little old Englishwoman, a Miss King, who had been their\ngoverness; but she sat at a table by herself and they appeared to pay no\nattention to her. Once Ashenden, going along a corridor, had come upon\nthe elder of the two fat princesses berating the governess in French\nwith a violence that took his breath away. She was shouting at the top\nof her voice and suddenly smacked the old woman's face. When she caught\nsight of Ashenden she gave him a furious look and flinging into her room\nslammed the door. He walked on as though he had noticed nothing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn his arrival Ashenden had tried to scrape acquaintance with Miss King,\nbut she had received his advances not merely with frigidity but with\nchurlishness. He had begun by taking off his hat when he met her, and\nshe had given him a stiff bow, then he had addressed her and she had\nanswered with such brevity that it was evident that she wished to have\nnothing much to do with him. But it was not his business to be\ndiscouraged, so with what assurance he could muster he took the first\nopportunity to enter into conversation with her. She drew herself up and\nsaid in French, but with an English accent:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't wish to make acquaintance with strangers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe turned her back on him and, next time he saw her, cut him dead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was a tiny woman, just a few little bones in a bag of wrinkled skin,\nand her face was deeply furrowed. It was obvious that she wore a wig, it\nwas of a mousy brown, very elaborate and not always set quite straight,\nand she was heavily made up, with great patches of scarlet on her\nwithered cheeks and brilliantly red lips. She dressed fantastically in\ngay clothes that looked as though they had been bought higgledy-piggledy\nfrom an old-clothes shop and in the day-time she wore enormous,\nextravagantly girlish hats. She tripped along in very small smart shoes\nwith very high heels. Her appearance was so grotesque that it created\nconsternation rather than amusement. People turned in the street and\nstared at her with open mouths.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was told that Miss King had not been to England since she was\nfirst engaged as governess of the prince's mother and he could not but\nbe amazed to think of all she must have seen during those long years in\nthe harems of Cairo. It was impossible to guess how old she was. How\nmany of those short Eastern lives must have run their course under her\neyes and what dark secrets must she have known! Ashenden wondered where\nshe came from; an exile from her own country for so long, she must\npossess in it neither family nor friends: he knew that her sentiments\nwere anti-English and if she had answered him so rudely he surmised that\nshe had been told to be on her guard against him. She never spoke\nanything but French. Ashenden wondered what it was she thought of as she\nsat there, at luncheon and dinner by herself. He wondered if ever she\nread. After meals she went straight upstairs and was never seen in the\npublic sitting-rooms. He wondered what she thought of those two\nemancipated princesses who wore garish frocks and danced with strange\nmen in second-rate cafés. But when Miss King passed him on her way out\nof the dining-room it seemed to Ashenden that her mask of a face\nscowled. She appeared actively to dislike him. Her gaze met his and the\npair of them looked at one another for a moment; he imagined that she\ntried to put into her stare an unspoken insult. It would have been\npleasantly absurd in that painted, withered visage if it had not been\nfor some reason rather oddly pathetic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut now the Baroness de Higgins, having finished her dinner, gathered up\nher handkerchief and her bag, and with waiters bowing on either side\nsailed down the spacious room. She stopped at Ashenden's table. She\nlooked magnificent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm so glad you can play bridge to-night,\" she said in perfect English,\nwith no more than a trace of German accent. \"Will you come to my\nsitting-room when you are ready and have your coffee?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a lovely dress,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is frightful. I have nothing to wear, I don't know what I shall do\nnow that I cannot go to Paris. Those horrible Prussians,\" and her r's\ngrew guttural as she raised her voice, \"why did they want to drag my\npoor country into this terrible war?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave a sigh, and a flashing smile, and sailed on. Ashenden was among\nthe last to finish and when he left the dining-room it was almost empty.\nAs he walked past Count Holzminden, Ashenden feeling very gay hazarded\nthe shadow of a wink. The German agent could not be quite sure of it and\nif he suspected it might rack his brains to discover what mystery it\nportended. Ashenden walked up to the second floor and knocked at the\nbaroness's door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Entrez, entrez</i>,\" she said and flung it open.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shook both his hands with cordiality and drew him into the room. He\nsaw that the two persons who were to make the four had already arrived.\nThey were Prince Ali and his secretary. Ashenden was astounded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Allow me to introduce Mr. Ashenden to Your Highness,\" said the\nbaroness, speaking in her fluent French.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden bowed and took the proffered hand. The prince gave him a quick\nlook, but did not speak. Madame de Higgins went on:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do not know if you have met the Pasha.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Ashenden,\" said the\nprince's secretary, warmly shaking his hand. \"Our beautiful baroness has\ntalked to us of your bridge and His Highness is devoted to the game.\n<i>N'est ce pas, Altesse?</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Oui, oui</i>,\" said the prince.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMustapha Pasha was a huge fat fellow, of forty-five perhaps, with large\nmobile eyes and a big black moustache. He wore a dinner jacket with a\nlarge diamond in his shirt-front and the <i>tarboosh</i> of his country. He\nwas exceedingly voluble, and the words tumbled out of his mouth\ntumultuously, like marbles out of a bag. He took pains to be extremely\ncivil to Ashenden. The prince sat in silence, looking at Ashenden\nquietly from under his heavy eyelids. He seemed shy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have not seen you at the club, <i>Monsieur</i>,\" said the pasha. \"Do you\nnot like baccarat?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I play but seldom.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The baroness, who has read everything, tells me that you are a\nremarkable writer. Unfortunately I do not read English.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe baroness paid Ashenden some very fulsome compliments to which he\nlistened with a proper and grateful politeness, and then, having\nprovided her guests with coffee and liqueurs, she produced the cards.\nAshenden could not but wonder why he had been asked to play. He had (he\nflattered himself) few illusions about himself, and so far as bridge was\nconcerned none. He knew that he was a good player of the second class,\nbut he had played often enough with the best players in the world to\nknow that he was not in the same street with them. The game played now\nwas contract, with which he was not very familiar, and the stakes were\nhigh; but the game was obviously but a pretext and Ashenden had no\nnotion what other game was being played under the rose. It might be that\nknowing he was a British agent the prince and his secretary had desired\nto see him in order to find out what sort of person he was. Ashenden had\nfelt for a day or two that something was in the air and this meeting\nconfirmed his suspicions, but he had not the faintest notion of what\nnature this something was. His spies had told him of late nothing that\nsignified. He was now persuaded that he owed that visit of the Swiss\npolice to the kindly intervention of the baroness and it looked as\nthough the bridge-party had been arranged when it was discovered that\nthe detectives had been able to do nothing. The notion was mysterious,\nbut diverting, and as Ashenden played one rubber after another, joining\nin the incessant conversation, he watched what was said by himself no\nless closely than what was said by the others. The war was spoken of a\ngood deal and the baroness and the pasha expressed very anti-German\nsentiments. The baroness's heart was in England whence her family (the\nstable-boy from Yorkshire) had sprung and the pasha looked upon Paris as\nhis spiritual home. When the pasha talked of Montmartre and its life by\nnight the prince was roused from his silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>C'est une bien belle ville, Paris</i>,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Prince has a beautiful apartment there,\" said his secretary, \"with\nbeautiful pictures and life-sized statues.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden explained that he had the greatest sympathy for the national\naspirations of Egypt and that he looked upon Vienna as the most pleasing\ncapital in Europe. He was as friendly to them as they were to him. But\nif they were under the impression that they would get any information\nout of him that they had not already seen in the Swiss papers he had a\nnotion that they were mistaken. At one moment he had a suspicion that he\nwas being sounded upon the possibility of selling himself. It was done\nso discreetly that he could not be quite sure, but he had a feeling that\na suggestion floated in the air that a clever writer could do his\ncountry a good turn and make a vast amount of money for himself if he\ncared to enter into an arrangement that would bring to a troubled world\nthe peace that every humane man must so sincerely desire. It was plain\nthat nothing very much would be said that first evening, but Ashenden as\nevasively as he could, more by general amiability than by words, tried\nto indicate that he was willing to hear more of the subject. While he\ntalked with the pasha and the beautiful Austrian he was conscious that\nthe watchful eyes of Prince Ali were upon him, and had an uneasy\nsuspicion that they read too much of his thoughts. He felt rather than\nknew that the prince was an able and astute man. It was possible that\nafter he left them the prince would tell the other two that they were\nwasting their time and there was nothing to be done with Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSoon after midnight, a rubber having been finished, the prince rose from\nthe table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is getting late,\" he said, \"and Mr. Ashenden has doubtless much to\ndo to-morrow. We must not keep him up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden looked upon this as a signal to take himself off. He left the\nthree together to discuss the situation and retired not a little\nmystified. He could only trust that they were no less puzzled than he.\nWhen he got to his room he suddenly realised that he was dog-tired. He\ncould hardly keep his eyes open while he undressed, and the moment he\nflung himself into bed he fell asleep.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe would have sworn that he had not been asleep five minutes when he was\ndragged back to wakefulness by a knocking at the door. He listened for a\nmoment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's the maid. Open. I have something to say to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCursing, Ashenden turned on his light, ran a hand through his thinning\nand rumpled hair (for like Julius Cæsar he disliked exposing an\nunbecoming baldness) and unlocked and opened the door. Outside it stood\na tousled Swiss maid. She wore no apron and looked as though she had\nthrown on her clothes in a hurry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The old English lady, the governess of the Egyptian princesses, is\ndying and she wants to see you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Me?\" said Ashenden. \"It's impossible. I don't know her. She was all\nright this evening.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was confused and spoke his thoughts as they came to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She asks for you. The doctor says, will you come. She cannot last much\nlonger.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must be a mistake. She can't want me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She said your name and the number of your room. She says quick, quick.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden shrugged his shoulders. He went back into his room to put on\nslippers and a dressing-gown, and as an after-thought dropped a small\nrevolver into his pocket. Ashenden believed much more in his acuteness\nthan in a firearm, which is apt to go off at the wrong time and make a\nnoise, but there are moments when it gives you confidence to feel your\nfingers round its butt, and this sudden summons seemed to him\nexceedingly mysterious. It was ridiculous to suppose that those two\ncordial stout Egyptian gentlemen were laying some sort of trap for him,\nbut in the work upon which Ashenden was engaged the dullness of routine\nwas apt now and again to slip quite shamelessly into the melodrama of\nthe sixties. Just as passion will make use brazenly of the hackneyed\nphrase, so will chance show itself insensitive to the triteness of the\nliterary convention.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss King's room was two floors higher than Ashenden's, and as he\naccompanied the chamber-maid along the corridor and up the stairs he\nasked her what was the matter with the old governess. She was flurried\nand stupid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think she has had a stroke. I don't know. The night-porter woke me\nand said Monsieur Bridet wanted me to get up at once.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMonsieur Bridet was the assistant-manager.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is the time?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must be three o'clock.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey arrived at Miss King's door and the maid knocked. It was opened by\nMonsieur Bridet. He had evidently been roused from his sleep; he wore\nslippers on his bare feet, grey trousers and a frock-coat over his\npyjamas. He looked absurd. His hair as a rule plastered neatly on his\nhead stood on end. He was extremely apologetic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A thousand excuses for disturbing you, Monsieur Ashenden, but she kept\nasking for you and the doctor said you should be sent for.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It doesn't matter at all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden walked in. It was a small back-room and all the lights were on.\nThe windows were closed and the curtains drawn. It was intensely hot.\nThe doctor, a bearded, grizzled Swiss, was standing at the bedside.\nMonsieur Bridet, notwithstanding his costume and his evident harassment,\nfound in himself the presence of mind to remain the attentive manager,\nand with ceremony effected the proper introduction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is Mr. Ashenden, for whom Miss King has been asking. Dr. Arbos of\nthe Faculty of Medicine of Geneva.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWithout a word the doctor pointed to the bed. On it lay Miss King. It\ngave Ashenden a shock to look at her. She wore a large white cotton\nnightcap (on entering Ashenden had noticed the brown wig on a stand on\nthe dressing-table) tied under the chin and a white, voluminous\nnightdress that came high up in the neck. Nightcap and nightdress\nbelonged to a past age and reminded you of Cruikshank's illustrations to\nthe novels of Charles Dickens. Her face was greasy still with the cream\nshe had used before going to bed to remove her make-up, but she had\nremoved it summarily and there were streaks of black on her eyebrows and\nof red on her cheeks. She looked very small, lying in the bed, no larger\nthan a child, and immensely old.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She must be well over eighty,\" thought Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe did not look human, but like a doll, the caricature of an old, old\nwitch that an ironic toymaker had amused himself with modelling. She lay\nperfectly still on her back, the tiny little body hardly marked under\nthe flatness of the blanket, her face even smaller than usual because\nshe had removed her teeth; and you would have thought she was dead but\nfor the black eyes, strangely large in the shrunken mask, that stared\nunblinkingly. Ashenden thought their expression changed when she saw\nhim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Miss King, I'm sorry to see you like this,\" he said with forced\ncheerfulness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She cannot speak,\" said the doctor. \"She had another little stroke when\nthe maid went to fetch you. I have just given her an injection. She may\npartly recover the use of her tongue in a little while. She has\nsomething to say to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will gladly wait,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe fancied that in those dark eyes he saw a look of relief. For a moment\nor two the four of them stood round the bed and stared at the dying\nwoman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if there is nothing I can do, I may just as well go back to bed,\"\nsaid Monsieur Bridet then.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Allez, mon ami</i>,\" said the doctor. \"You can do nothing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMonsieur Bridet turned to Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"May I have a word with you?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Certainly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor noticed a sudden fear in Miss King's eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do not be alarmed,\" he said kindly. \"Monsieur Ashenden is not going. He\nwill stay as long as you wish.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe assistant-manager took Ashenden to the door and partly closed it so\nthat those within should not hear his undertones.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can count on your discretion, Monsieur Ashenden, can I not? It is a\nvery disagreeable thing to have anyone die in a hotel. The other guests\ndo not like it and we must do all we can to prevent their knowing. I\nshall have the body removed the first possible moment and I shall be\nextremely obliged if you will not say that there has been a death.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can have every confidence in me,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is very unfortunate that the manager should be away for the night. I\nam afraid he will be exceedingly displeased. Of course if it had been\npossible I would have sent for an ambulance and had her taken to the\nhospital, but the doctor said she might die before we got her downstairs\nand absolutely refused to let me. It is not my fault if she dies in the\nhotel.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Death so often chooses its moments without consideration,\" murmured\nAshenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After all she is an old woman, she should have died years ago. What did\nthis Egyptian prince want to have a governess of that age for? He ought\nto have sent her back to her own country. These Orientals, they are\nalways giving trouble.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where is the prince now?\" asked Ashenden. \"She has been in his service\nfor many years. Ought you not to wake him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He is not in the hotel. He went out with his secretary. He may be\nplaying baccarat. I do not know. Anyhow I cannot send all over Geneva to\nfind him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And the princesses?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They have not come in. They seldom return to the hotel till dawn. They\nare mad about dancing. I do not know where they are; in any case they\nwould not thank me for dragging them away from their diversions because\ntheir governess has had a stroke. I know what they are. The night-porter\nwill tell them when they arrive and then they can please themselves. She\ndoes not want them. When the night-porter fetched me and I went into her\nroom I asked where His Highness was and she cried with all her strength:\nno, no.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She could talk then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, after a fashion, but the thing that surprised me was that she\nspoke in English. She always insisted on talking French. You know, she\nhated the English.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did she want with me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That I cannot tell you. She said she had something that she must say to\nyou at once. It is funny, she knew the number of your room. At first\nwhen she asked for you I would not let them send. I cannot have my\nclients disturbed in the middle of the night because a crazy old woman\nasks for them. You have the right to your sleep, I imagine. But when the\ndoctor came he insisted. She gave us no peace and when I said she must\nwait till morning she cried.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden looked at the assistant-manager. He seemed to find nothing at\nall touching in the scene he related.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The doctor asked who you were and when I told him he said that perhaps\nshe wished to see you because you were a compatriot.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps,\" said Ashenden dryly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I shall try to get a little sleep. I shall give the night-porter\norders to wake me when everything is over. Fortunately the nights are\nlong now and if everything goes well we may be able to get the body away\nbefore it is light.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden went back into the room and immediately the dark eyes of the\ndying woman fixed upon him. He felt that it was incumbent upon him to\nsay something, but as he spoke he reflected on the foolish way in which\none speaks to the sick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid you're feeling very ill, Miss King.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt seemed to him that a flash of anger crossed her eyes and Ashenden\ncould not but imagine that she was exasperated by his futile words.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You do not mind waiting?\" asked the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt appeared that the night-porter had been roused by the ringing of the\ntelephone from Miss King's room, but on listening could get no one to\nspeak. The bell continued to ring, so he went upstairs and knocked at\nthe door. He entered with his pass-key and found Miss King lying on the\nfloor. The telephone had fallen too. It looked as though, feeling ill,\nshe had taken off the receiver to call for help and then collapsed. The\nnight-porter hurried to fetch the assistant-manager and together they\nhad lifted her back into bed. Then the maid was wakened and the doctor\nsent for. It gave Ashenden a queer feeling to listen to the doctor\ngiving him these facts in Miss King's hearing. He spoke as though she\ncould not understand his French. He spoke as though she were already\ndead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen the doctor said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, there is really nothing more that I can do. It is useless for me\nto stay. I can be rung up if there is any change.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden, knowing that Miss King might remain in that condition for\nhours, shrugged his shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor patted her raddled cheek as though she were a child.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must try to sleep. I will come back in the morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe packed up the despatch-case in which he had his medical appliances,\nwashed his hands and shuffled himself into a heavy coat. Ashenden\naccompanied him to the door and as he shook hands the doctor gave his\nprognosis in a pout of his bearded mouth. Ashenden, coming back, looked\nat the maid. She sat on the edge of a chair, uneasily, as though in the\npresence of death she feared to presume. Her broad, ugly face was\nbloated with fatigue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no use in your staying up,\" Ashenden said to her. \"Why don't\nyou go to bed?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Monsieur</i> wouldn't like to remain here alone. Somebody must stay with\nhim.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But good heavens, why? You have your day's work to do to-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In any case I have to get up at five.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then try to get a little sleep now. You can give me a look in when you\nget up. <i>Allez.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe rose heavily to her feet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As the gentleman wishes. But I will stay very willingly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden smiled and shook his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Bonsoir, ma pauvre mademoiselle</i>,\" said the maid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe went out and Ashenden was left alone. He sat by the bedside and\nagain his eyes met Miss King's. It was embarrassing to encounter that\nunshrinking stare.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't worry yourself, Miss King. You've had a slight stroke. I'm sure\nyour speech will come back to you in a minute.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe felt certain then that he saw in those dark eyes a desperate effort\nto speak. He could not be mistaken. The mind was shaken by desire, but\nthe paralysed body was incapable of obedience. For her disappointment\nexpressed itself quite plainly, tears came to her eyes and ran down her\ncheeks. Ashenden took out his handkerchief and dried them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't distress yourself, Miss King. Have a little patience and I'm sure\nyou'll be able to say anything you want.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not know if it was his fancy that he read in her eyes now the\ndespairing thought that she had not the time to wait. Perhaps it was\nonly that he ascribed to her the notions that came to himself. On the\ndressing-table were the governess's poor little toilet things,\nsilver-backed embossed brushes and a silver mirror, in a corner stood a\nshabby black trunk and on the top of the wardrobe a large hat-box in\nshiny leather. It all looked poor and mean in that trim hotel room, with\nits suite in highly varnished rose-wood. The glare was intolerable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wouldn't you be more comfortable if I turned out some of the lights?\"\nasked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put out all the lamps but the one by the bedside and then sat down\nagain. He had a longing to smoke. Once more his eyes were held by those\nother eyes in which was all that remained alive of that old, old woman.\nHe felt certain that she had something that she wanted urgently to say\nto him. But what was it? What was it? Perhaps she had asked him only\nbecause, feeling death near, she had had a sudden yearning, she the\nexile of so many years, to die with someone of her own people, so long\nforgotten, by her side. That was what the doctor thought. But why should\nshe have sent for him? There were other English people in the hotel.\nThere was an old pair, a retired Indian Civilian and his wife, to whom\nit seemed more natural that she should turn. No one could be more of a\nstranger to her than Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you got something to say to me, Miss King?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe tried to read an answer in her eyes. They continued to stare at him\nmeaningly, but what the meaning was he had no notion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be afraid I shall go. I will stay as long as you want me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNothing, nothing. The black eyes, and as he looked at them they seemed\nto glow mysteriously as though there were fire behind them, the eyes\ncontinued to hold him with that insistent stare. Then Ashenden asked\nhimself if she had sent for him because she knew that he was a British\nagent. Was it possible that at that last moment she had had some\nunexpected revulsion of feeling from everything that had signified to\nher for so many years? Perhaps at the moment of death a love for her\ncountry, a love that had been dead for half a century, awakened again in\nher--(\"I'm silly to fancy these idiotic things,\" thought Ashenden, \"it's\ncheap and tawdry fiction.\")--and she had been seized with a desire to do\nsomething for what was after all her own. No one was quite himself just\nthen and patriotism (in peace-time an attitude best left to politicians,\npublicists and fools, but in the dark days of war an emotion that can\nwring the heart-strings), patriotism made one do odd things. It was\ncurious that she had been unwilling to see the prince and his daughters.\nDid she on a sudden hate them? Did she feel herself a traitor on their\naccount and now at the last hour wish to make amends. (\"It's all very\nimprobable, she's just a silly old maid who ought to have died years\nago.\") But you couldn't ignore the improbable. Ashenden, his\ncommon-sense protesting, became strangely convinced that she had some\nsecret that she wished to impart to him. She had sent for him knowing\nwho he was because he could make use of it. She was dying and feared\nnothing. But was it really important? Ashenden leaned forward trying\nmore eagerly to read what her eyes had to say. Perhaps it was only some\ntrivial thing that was important only in her addled old brain. Ashenden\nwas sick of the people who saw spies in every inoffensive passer-by and\nplots in the most innocent combination of circumstances. It was a\nhundred to one that if Miss King recovered her speech she would tell him\nsomething that could be of no use to anybody.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut how much must that old woman know! With her sharp eyes and sharp\nears she must have had the chance to discover matters that were closely\nhidden from persons that seemed less insignificant. Ashenden thought\nagain how he had the impression that something of real consequence was\nbeing prepared round about him. It was curious that Holzminden should\nhave come to the hotel that day; and why had Prince Ali and the pasha,\nthose wild gamblers, wasted an evening in playing contract-bridge with\nhim? It might be that some new plan was in question, it might be that\nthe very greatest affairs were afoot, and perhaps what the old woman had\nto say might make all the difference in the world. It might mean defeat\nor victory. It might mean anything. And there she lay powerless to\nspeak. For a long time Ashenden stared at her in silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Has it got anything to do with the war, Miss King?\" he said on a\nsudden, loudly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSomething passed through her eyes and a tremor shot across her little\nold face. It was a distinct movement. Something strange and horrible was\nhappening and Ashenden held his breath. The tiny frail body was suddenly\nconvulsed and that old woman, as though by a final desperate effort of\nwill, raised herself up in the bed. Ashenden sprang forward to support\nher.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"England,\" she said, just that one word, in a harsh cracked voice, and\nfell back in his arms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen he laid her down on the pillow, he saw that she was dead.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you like macaroni?\" said R.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean by macaroni?\" answered Ashenden. \"It is like asking me\nif I like poetry. I like Keats and Wordsworth and Verlaine and Goethe.\nWhen you say macaroni, do you mean <i>spaghetti, tagliatelli, vermicelli,\nfettucini, tufali, farfalli,</i> or just macaroni?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Macaroni,\" replied R., a man of few words.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I like all simple things, boiled eggs, oysters and caviare, <i>truite au\nbleu</i>, grilled salmon, roast lamb (the saddle by preference), cold\ngrouse, treacle tart and rice pudding. But of all simple things the only\none I can eat day in and day out, not only without disgust but with the\neagerness of an appetite unimpaired by excess, is macaroni.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am glad of that because I want you to go down to Italy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden had come from Geneva to meet R. at Lyons and having got there\nbefore him had spent the afternoon wandering about the dull, busy and\nprosaic streets of that thriving city. They were sitting now in a\nrestaurant on the <i>place</i> to which Ashenden had taken R. on his arrival\nbecause it was reputed to give you the best food in that part of France.\nBut since in so crowded a resort (for the Lyonese like a good dinner)\nyou never knew what inquisitive ears were pricked up to catch any useful\npiece of information that might fall from your lips, they had contented\nthemselves with talking of indifferent things. They had reached the end\nof an admirable repast.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have another glass of brandy?\" said R.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, thank you,\" answered Ashenden, who was of an abstemious turn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One should do what one can to mitigate the rigours of war,\" remarked R.\nas he took the bottle and poured out a glass for himself and another for\nAshenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden, thinking it would be affectation to protest, let the gesture\npass, but felt bound to remonstrate with his chief on the unseemly\nmanner in which he held the bottle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In my youth I was always taught that you should take a woman by the\nwaist and a bottle by the neck,\" he murmured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am glad you told me. I shall continue to hold a bottle by the waist\nand give women a wide berth.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden did not know what to reply to this and so remained silent. He\nsipped his brandy and R. called for his bill. It was true that he was an\nimportant person, with power to make or mar quite a large number of his\nfellows, and his opinions were listened to by those who held in their\nhands the fate of empires; but he could never face the business of\ntipping a waiter without an embarrassment that was obvious in his\ndemeanour. He was tortured by the fear of making a fool of himself by\ngiving too much or of exciting the waiter's icy scorn by giving too\nlittle. When the bill came he passed some hundred-franc notes over to\nAshenden and said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pay him, will you? I can never understand French figures.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe groom brought them their hats and coats.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would you like to go back to the hotel?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We might as well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was early in the year, but the weather had suddenly turned warm, and\nthey walked with their coats over their arms. Ashenden knowing that R.\nliked a sitting-room had engaged one for him and to this, when they\nreached the hotel, they went. The hotel was old-fashioned and the\nsitting-room was vast. It was furnished with a heavy mahogany suite\nupholstered in green velvet and the chairs were set primly round a large\ntable. On the walls, covered with a dingy paper, were large steel\nengravings of the battles of Napoleon, and from the ceiling hung an\nenormous chandelier once used for gas, but now fitted with electric\nbulbs. It flooded the cheerless room with a cold, hard light.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is very nice,\" said R., as they went in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not exactly cosy,\" suggested Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, but it looks as though it were the best room in the place. It all\nlooks very <i>good</i> to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe drew one of the green velvet chairs away from the table and, sitting\ndown, lit a cigar. He loosened his belt and unbuttoned his tunic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I always thought I liked a cheroot better than anything,\" he said, \"but\nsince the war I've taken quite a fancy to Havanas. Oh well, I suppose it\ncan't last for ever.\" The corners of his mouth flickered with the\nbeginning of a smile. \"It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden took two chairs, one to sit on and one for his feet, and when\nR. saw him he said: \"That's not a bad idea,\" and swinging another chair\nout from the table with a sigh of relief put his boots on it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What room is that next door?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's your bedroom.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And on the other side?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A banqueting hall.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. got up and strolled slowly about the room and when he passed the\nwindows, as though in idle curiosity, peeped through the heavy rep\ncurtains that covered them, and then returning to his chair once more\ncomfortably put his feet up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's just as well not to take any more risk than one need,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at Ashenden reflectively. There was a slight smile on his thin\nlips, but the pale eyes, too closely set together, remained cold and\nsteely. R.'s stare would have been embarrassing if Ashenden had not been\nused to it. He knew that R. was considering how he would broach the\nsubject that he had in mind. The silence must have lasted for two or\nthree minutes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm expecting a fellow to come and see me to-night,\" he said at last.\n\"His train gets in about ten.\" He gave his wrist-watch a glance. \"He's\nknown as the Hairless Mexican.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Because he's hairless and because he's a Mexican.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The explanation seems perfectly satisfactory,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He'll tell you all about himself. He talks nineteen to the dozen. He\nwas on his uppers when I came across him. It appears that he was mixed\nup in some revolution in Mexico and had to get out with nothing but the\nclothes he stood up in. They were rather the worse for wear when I found\nhim. If you want to please him you call him General. He claims to have\nbeen a general in Huerta's army, at least I think it was Huerta; anyhow\nhe says that if things had gone right he would be Minister of War now\nand no end of a big bug. I've found him very useful. Not a bad chap. The\nonly thing I really have against him is that he will use scent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And where do I come in?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's going down to Italy. I've got rather a ticklish job for him to do\nand I want you to stand by. I'm not keen on trusting him with a lot of\nmoney. He's a gambler and he's a bit too fond of the girls. I suppose\nyou came from Geneva on your Ashenden passport?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got another for you, a diplomatic one, by the way, in the name of\nSomerville with visas for France and Italy. I think you and he had\nbetter travel together. He's an amusing cove when he gets going, and I\nthink you ought to know one another.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is the job?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't yet quite made up my mind how much it's desirable for you to\nknow about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden did not reply. They eyed one another in a detached manner, as\nthough they were strangers who sat together in a railway carriage and\neach wondered who and what the other was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In your place I'd leave the General to do most of the talking. I\nwouldn't tell him more about yourself than you find absolutely\nnecessary. He won't ask you any questions, I can promise you that, I\nthink he's by way of being a gentleman after his own fashion.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, what is his real name?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I always call him Manuel, I don't know that he likes it very much, his\nname is Manuel Carmona.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I gather by what you have not said that he's an unmitigated scoundrel.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. smiled with his pale-blue eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know that I'd go quite so far as that. He hasn't had the\nadvantages of a public-school education. His ideas of playing the game\nare not quite the same as yours or mine. I don't know that I'd leave a\ngold cigarette-case about when he was in the neighbourhood, but if he\nlost money to you at poker and had pinched your cigarette-case he would\nimmediately pawn it to pay you. If he had half a chance he'd seduce your\nwife, but if you were up against it he'd share his last crust with you.\nThe tears will run down his face when he hears Gounod's 'Ave Maria' on\nthe gramophone, but if you insult his dignity he'll shoot you like a\ndog. It appears that in Mexico it's an insult to get between a man and\nhis drink and he told me himself that once when a Dutchman who didn't\nknow passed between him and the bar he whipped out his revolver and shot\nhim dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did nothing happen to him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, it appears that he belongs to one of the best families. The matter\nwas hushed up and it was announced in the papers that the Dutchman had\ncommitted suicide. He did practically. I don't believe the Hairless\nMexican has a great respect for human life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden, who had been looking intently at R., started a little and he\nwatched more carefully than ever his chief's tired, lined and yellow\nface. He knew that he did not make this remark for nothing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course a lot of nonsense is talked about the value of human life.\nYou might just as well say that the counters you use at poker have an\nintrinsic value, their value is what you like to make it; for a general\ngiving battle, men are merely counters and he's a fool if he allows\nhimself for sentimental reasons to look upon them as human beings.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But, you see, they're counters that feel and think and if they believe\nthey're being squandered they are quite capable of refusing to be used\nany more.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Anyhow, that's neither here nor there. We've had information that a man\ncalled Constantine Andreadi is on his way from Constantinople with\ncertain documents that we want to get hold of. He's a Greek. He's an\nagent of Enver Pasha and Enver has great confidence in him. He's given\nhim verbal messages that are too secret and too important to be put on\npaper. He's sailing from the Piræus, on a boat called the <i>Ithaca</i>, and\nwill land at Brindisi on his way to Rome. He's to deliver his despatches\nat the German Embassy and impart what he has to say personally to the\nambassador.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt this time Italy was still neutral; the Central Powers were straining\nevery nerve to keep her so; the Allies were doing what they could to\ninduce her to declare war on their side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We don't want to get into any trouble with the Italian authorities, it\nmight be fatal, but we've got to prevent Andreadi from getting to Rome.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At any cost?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Money's no object,\" answered R., his lips twisting into a sardonic\nsmile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you propose to do?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think you need bother your head about that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have a fertile imagination,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want you to go down to Naples with the Hairless Mexican. He's very\nkeen on getting back to Cuba. It appears that his friends are organising\na show and he wants to be as near at hand as possible so that he can hop\nover to Mexico when things are ripe. He needs cash. I've brought money\ndown with me, in American dollars, and I shall give it to you to-night.\nYou'd better carry it on your person.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it much?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a good deal, but I thought it would be easier for you if it wasn't\nbulky, so I've got it in thousand-dollar notes. You will give the\nHairless Mexican the notes in return for the documents that Andreadi is\nbringing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA question sprang to Ashenden's lips, but he did not ask it. He asked\nanother instead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does this fellow understand what he has to do?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perfectly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a knock at the door. It opened and the Hairless Mexican stood\nbefore them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have arrived. Good-evening, Colonel. I am enchanted to see you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Had a nice journey, Manuel? This is Mr. Somerville, who's going to\nNaples with you, General Carmona.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pleased to meet you, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe shook Ashenden's hand with such force that he winced.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your hands are like iron, General,\" he murmured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Mexican gave them a glance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I had them manicured this morning. I do not think they were very well\ndone. I like my nails much more highly polished.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were cut to a point, stained bright red, and to Ashenden's mind\nshone like mirrors. Though it was not cold the General wore a fur coat\nwith an astrakhan collar and with his every movement a wave of perfume\nwas wafted to your nose.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Take off your coat, General, and have a cigar,\" said R.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Hairless Mexican was a tall man, and though thinnish gave you the\nimpression of being very powerful; he was smartly dressed in a blue\nserge suit, with a silk handkerchief neatly tucked in the breast pocket\nof his coat, and he wore a gold bracelet on his wrist. His features were\ngood, but a little larger than life-size, and his eyes were brown and\nlustrous. He was quite hairless. His yellow skin had the smoothness of a\nwoman's and he had no eyebrows nor eyelashes; he wore a pale brown wig,\nrather long, and the locks were arranged in artistic disorder. This and\nthe unwrinkled sallow face, combined with his dandified dress, gave him\nan appearance that was at first glance a trifle horrifying. He was\nrepulsive and ridiculous, but you could not take your eyes from him.\nThere was a sinister fascination in his strangeness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sat down and hitched up his trousers so that they should not bag at\nthe knee.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Manuel, have you been breaking any hearts to-day?\" said R. with\nhis sardonic joviality.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe General turned to Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Our good friend, the Colonel, envies me my successes with the fair sex.\nI tell him he can have just as many as I if he will only listen to me.\nConfidence, that is all you need. If you never fear a rebuff you will\nnever have one.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nonsense, Manuel, one has to have your way with the girls. There's\nsomething about you that they can't resist.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Hairless Mexican laughed with a self-satisfaction that he did not\ntry to disguise. He spoke English very well, with a Spanish accent, but\nwith an American intonation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But since you ask me, Colonel, I don't mind telling you that I got into\nconversation on the train with a little woman who was coming to Lyons to\nsee her mother-in-law. She was not very young and she was thinner than I\nlike a woman to be, but she was possible, and she helped me to pass an\nagreeable hour.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, let's get to business,\" said R.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am at your service, Colonel.\" He gave Ashenden a glance. \"Is Mr.\nSomerville a military man?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No,\" said R., \"he's an author.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It takes all sorts to make a world, as you say. I am happy to make your\nacquaintance, Mr. Somerville. I can tell you many stories that will\ninterest you; I am sure that we shall get on well together. You have a\nsympathetic air. I am very sensitive to that. To tell you the truth I am\nnothing but a bundle of nerves and if I am with a person who is\nantipathetic to me I go all to pieces.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope we shall have a pleasant journey,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When does our friend arrive at Brindisi?\" asked the Mexican, turning to\nR.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He sails from the Piræus in the <i>Ithaca</i> on the fourteenth. It's\nprobably some old tub, but you'd better get down to Brindisi in good\ntime.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I agree with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. got up and with his hands in his pockets sat on the edge of the\ntable. In his rather shabby uniform, his tunic unbuttoned, he looked a\nslovenly creature beside the neat and well-dressed Mexican.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Somerville knows practically nothing of the errand on which you are\ngoing and I do not desire you to tell him anything. I think you had much\nbetter keep your own counsel. He is instructed to give you the funds you\nneed for your work, but your actions are your own affair. If you need\nhis advice of course you can ask for it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I seldom ask other people's advice and never take it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And should you make a mess of things I trust you to keep Mr. Somerville\nout of it. He must on no account be compromised.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am a man of honour, Colonel,\" answered the Hairless Mexican with\ndignity, \"and I would sooner let myself be cut in a thousand pieces than\nbetray my friends.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is what I have already told Mr. Somerville. On the other hand, if\neverything pans out O.K. Mr. Somerville is instructed to give you the\nsum we agreed on in return for the papers I spoke to you about. In what\nmanner you get them is no business of his.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That goes without saying. There is only one thing I wish to make quite\nplain; Mr. Somerville understands of course that I have not accepted the\nmission with which you have entrusted me on account of the money?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite,\" replied R. gravely, looking him straight in the eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am with the Allies body and soul, I cannot forgive the Germans for\noutraging the neutrality of Belgium, and if I accept the money that you\nhave offered me it is because I am first and foremost a patriot. I can\ntrust Mr. Somerville implicitly, I suppose?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. nodded. The Mexican turned to Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"An expedition is being arranged to free my unhappy country from the\ntyrants that exploit and ruin it and every penny that I receive will go\non guns and cartridges. For myself I have no need of money; I am a\nsoldier and I can live on a crust and a few olives. There are only three\noccupations that befit a gentleman, war, cards and women; it costs\nnothing to sling a rifle over your shoulder and take to the\nmountains--and that is real warfare, not this manoeuvring of battalions\nand firing of great guns--women love me for myself, and I generally win\nat cards.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden found the flamboyance of this strange creature, with his\nscented handkerchief and his gold bracelet, very much to his taste. This\nwas far from being just the man in the street (whose tyranny we rail at\nbut in the end submit to) and to the amateur of the baroque in human\nnature he was a rarity to be considered with delight. He was a purple\npatch on two legs. Notwithstanding his wig and his hairless big face, he\nhad undoubtedly an air; he was absurd, but he did not give you the\nimpression that he was a man to be trifled with. His self-complacency\nwas magnificent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where is your kit, Manuel?\" asked R.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was possible that a frown for an instant darkened the Mexican's brow\nat the abrupt question that seemed a little contemptuously to brush to\none side his eloquent statement, but he gave no other sign of\ndispleasure. Ashenden suspected that he thought the Colonel a barbarian\ninsensitive to the finer emotions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I left it at the station.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Somerville has a diplomatic passport so that he can get it through\nwith his own things at the frontier without examination if you like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have very little, a few suits and some linen, but perhaps it would be\nas well if Mr. Somerville would take charge of it. I bought half a dozen\nsuits of silk pyjamas before I left Paris.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what about you?\" asked R., turning to Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've only got one bag. It's in my room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd better have it taken to the station while there's someone about.\nYour train goes at one ten.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis was the first Ashenden had heard that they were to start that\nnight.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think you'd better get down to Naples as soon as possible.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going to bed. I don't know what you fellows want to do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall take a walk about Lyons,\" said the Hairless Mexican. \"I am\ninterested in life. Lend me a hundred francs, Colonel, will you? I have\nno change on me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. took out his pocket-book and gave the General the note he asked for.\nThen to Ashenden:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do? Wait here?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No,\" said Ashenden, \"I shall go to the station and read.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd both of you better have a whisky and soda before you go, hadn't\nyou? What about it, Manuel?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is very kind of you, but I never drink anything but champagne and\nbrandy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mixed?\" asked R. dryly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not necessarily,\" returned the other with gravity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. ordered brandy and soda and when it came, whereas he and Ashenden\nhelped themselves to both, the Hairless Mexican poured himself out three\nparts of a tumbler of neat brandy and swallowed it in two noisy gulps.\nHe rose to his feet and put on his coat with the astrakhan collar,\nseized in one hand his bold black hat and, with the gesture of a\nromantic actor giving up the girl he loves to one more worthy of her,\nheld out the other to R.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Colonel, I will bid you good-night and pleasant dreams. I do not\nexpect that we shall meet again so soon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't make a hash of things, Manuel, and if you do, keep your mouth\nshut.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They tell me that in one of your colleges where the sons of gentlemen\nare trained to become naval officers it is written in letters of gold:\nThere is no such word as impossible in the British Navy. I do not know\nthe meaning of the word failure.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It has a good many synonyms,\" retorted R.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will meet you at the station, Mr. Somerville,\" said the Hairless\nMexican, and with a flourish left them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. looked at Ashenden with that little smile of his that always made his\nface look so dangerously shrewd.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what d'you think of him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got me beat,\" said Ashenden. \"Is he a mountebank? He seems as\nvain as a peacock. And with that frightful appearance can he really be\nthe lady's man he pretends? What makes you think you can trust him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. gave a low chuckle and he washed his thin, old hands with imaginary\nsoap.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought you'd like him. He's quite a character, isn't he? I think we\ncan trust him.\" R.'s eyes suddenly grew opaque. \"I don't believe it\nwould pay him to double-cross us.\" He paused for a moment. \"Anyhow,\nwe've got to risk it. I'll give you the tickets and the money and then\nyou can take yourself off; I'm all in and I want to go to bed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTen minutes later Ashenden set out for the station with his bag on a\nporter's shoulder.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHaving nearly two hours to wait he made himself comfortable in the\nwaiting-room. The light was good and he read a novel. When the time drew\nnear for the arrival of the train from Paris that was to take them\ndirect to Rome and the Hairless Mexican did not appear, Ashenden,\nbeginning to grow a trifle anxious, went out on the platform to look for\nhim. Ashenden suffered from that distressing malady known as train\nfever: an hour before his train was due he began to have apprehensions\nlest he should miss it; he was impatient with the porters who would\nnever bring his luggage down from his room in time and he could not\nunderstand why the hotel bus cut it so fine; a block in the street would\ndrive him to frenzy and the languid movements of the station porters\ninfuriate him. The whole world seemed in a horrid plot to delay him;\npeople got in his way as he passed through the barriers; others, a long\nstring of them, were at the ticket-office getting tickets for other\ntrains than his and they counted their change with exasperating care;\nhis luggage took an interminable time to register; and then if he was\ntravelling with friends they would go to buy newspapers, or would take a\nwalk along the platform, and he was certain they would be left behind,\nthey would stop to talk to a casual stranger or suddenly be seized with\na desire to telephone and disappear at a run. In fact the universe\nconspired to make him miss every train he wanted to take and he was not\nhappy unless he was settled in his corner, his things on the rack above\nhim, with a good half-hour to spare. Sometimes by arriving at the\nstation too soon he had caught an earlier train than the one he had\nmeant to, but that was nerve-racking and caused him all the anguish of\nvery nearly missing it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Rome express was signalled and there was no sign of the Hairless\nMexican; it came in and he was not to be seen. Ashenden became more and\nmore harassed. He walked quickly up and down the platform, looked in all\nthe waiting-rooms, went to the consigne where the luggage was left; he\ncould not find him. There were no sleeping-cars, but a number of people\ngot out and he took two seats in a first-class carriage. He stood by the\ndoor, looking up and down the platform and up at the clock; it was\nuseless to go if his travelling companion did not turn up, and Ashenden\nmade up his mind to take his things out of the carriage as the porter\ncried <i>en voiture</i>; but, by George! he would give the brute hell when he\nfound him. There were three minutes more, then two minutes, then one; at\nthat late hour there were few persons about and all who were travelling\nhad taken their seats. Then he saw the Hairless Mexican, followed by two\nporters with his luggage and accompanied by a man in a bowler-hat, walk\nleisurely on to the platform. He caught sight of Ashenden and waved to\nhim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, my dear fellow, there you are, I wondered what had become of you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good God, man, hurry up or we shall miss the train.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never miss a train. Have you got good seats? The <i>chef de gare</i> has\ngone for the night; this is his assistant.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe man in the bowler-hat took it off when Ashenden nodded to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But this is an ordinary carriage. I am afraid I could not travel in\nthat.\" He turned to the stationmaster's assistant with an affable smile.\n\"You must do better for me than that, <i>mon cher</i>.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Certainement, mon général</i>, I will put you into a <i>salon-lit</i>. Of\ncourse.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe assistant stationmaster led them along the train and opened the door\nof an empty compartment where there were two beds. The Mexican eyed it\nwith satisfaction and watched the porters arrange the luggage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That will do very well. I am much obliged to you.\" He held out his hand\nto the man in the bowler-hat. \"I shall not forget you and next time I\nsee the Minister I will tell him with what civility you have treated\nme.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are too good, General. I shall be very grateful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA whistle was blown and the train started.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is better than an ordinary first-class carriage, I think, Mr.\nSomerville,\" said the Mexican. \"A good traveller should learn how to\nmake the best of things.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Ashenden was still extremely cross.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know why the devil you wanted to cut it so fine. We should have\nlooked a pair of damned fools if we'd missed the train.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear fellow, there was never the smallest chance of that. When I\narrived I told the stationmaster that I was General Carmona,\nCommander-in-Chief of the Mexican Army, and that I had to stop off in\nLyons for a few hours to hold a conference with the British\nField-Marshal. I asked him to hold the train for me if I was delayed and\nsuggested that my government might see its way to conferring an order on\nhim. I have been to Lyons before, I like the girls here; they have not\nthe <i>chic</i> of the Parisians, but they have something, there is no\ndenying that they have something. Will you have a mouthful of brandy\nbefore you go to sleep?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, thank you,\" said Ashenden morosely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I always drink a glass before going to bed, it settles the nerves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked in his suitcase and without difficulty found a bottle. He put\nit to his lips and had a long drink, wiped his mouth with the back of\nhis hand and lit a cigarette. Then he took off his boots and lay down.\nAshenden dimmed the light.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have never yet made up my mind,\" said the Hairless Mexican\nreflectively, \"whether it is pleasanter to go to sleep with the kisses\nof a beautiful woman on your mouth or with a cigarette between your\nlips. Have you ever been to Mexico? I will tell you about Mexico\nto-morrow. Good-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSoon Ashenden heard from his steady breathing that he was asleep and in\na little while himself dozed off. Presently he woke. The Mexican, deep\nin slumber, lay motionless; he had taken off his fur coat and was using\nit as a blanket; he still wore his wig. Suddenly there was a jolt and\nthe train with a noisy grinding of brakes stopped; in the twinkling of\nan eye, before Ashenden could realize that anything had happened, the\nMexican was on his feet with his hand to his hip.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it?\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing. Probably only a signal against us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Mexican sat down heavily on his bed. Ashenden turned on the light.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You wake quickly for such a sound sleeper,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You have to in my profession.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden would have liked to ask him whether this was murder, conspiracy\nor commanding armies, but was not sure that it would be discreet. The\nGeneral opened his bag and took out the bottle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you have a nip?\" he asked. \"There is nothing like it when you wake\nsuddenly in the night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ashenden refused he put the bottle once more to his lips and poured\na considerable quantity of liquor down his throat. He sighed and lit a\ncigarette. Although Ashenden had seen him now drink nearly a bottle of\nbrandy, and it was probable that he had had a good deal more when he was\ngoing about the town, he was certainly quite sober. Neither in his\nmanner nor in his speech was there any indication that he had drunk\nduring the evening anything but lemonade.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe train started and Ashenden again fell asleep. When he awoke it was\nmorning and turning round lazily he saw that the Mexican was awake too.\nHe was smoking a cigarette. The floor by his side was strewn with\nburnt-out butts and the air was thick and grey. He had begged Ashenden\nnot to insist on opening a window, for he said the night air was\ndangerous.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I did not get up, because I was afraid of waking you. Will you do your\ntoilet first or shall I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm in no hurry,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am an old campaigner, it will not take me long. Do you wash your\nteeth every day?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So do I. It is a habit I learned in New York. I always think that a\nfine set of teeth are an adornment to a man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a wash-basin in the compartment and the General scrubbed his\nteeth, with gurglings and garglings, energetically. Then he got a bottle\nof eau-de-Cologne from his bag, poured some of it on a towel and rubbed\nit over his face and hands. He took a comb and carefully arranged his\nwig; either it had not moved in the night or else he had set it straight\nbefore Ashenden awoke. He got another bottle out of his bag, with a\nspray attached to it, and squeezing a bulb covered his shirt and coat\nwith a fine cloud of scent, did the same to his handkerchief, and then\nwith a beaming face, like a man who has done his duty by the world and\nis well pleased, turned to Ashenden and said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now I am ready to brave the day. I will leave my things for you, you\nneed not be afraid of the eau-de-Cologne, it is the best you can get in\nParis.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Ashenden. \"All I want is soap and water.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Water? I never use water except when I have a bath. Nothing can be\nworse for the skin.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen they approached the frontier, Ashenden, remembering the General's\ninstructive gesture when he was suddenly awakened in the night, said to\nhim:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you've got a revolver on you I think you'd better give it to me.\nWith my diplomatic passport they're not likely to search me, but they\nmight take it into their heads to go through you and we don't want to\nhave any bothers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is hardly a weapon, it is only a toy,\" returned the Mexican, taking\nout of his hip-pocket a fully loaded revolver of formidable dimensions.\n\"I do not like parting with it even for an hour, it gives me the feeling\nthat I am not fully dressed. But you are quite right, we do not want to\ntake any risks; I will give you my knife as well, I would always rather\nuse a knife than a revolver; I think it is a more elegant weapon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say it is only a matter of habit,\" answered Ashenden. \"Perhaps\nyou are more at home with a knife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Anyone can pull a trigger, but it needs a man to use a knife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo Ashenden it looked as though it were in a single movement that he\ntore open his waistcoat and from his belt snatched and opened a long\nknife of murderous aspect. He handed it to Ashenden with a pleased smile\non his large, ugly and naked face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's a pretty piece of work for you, Mr. Somerville. I've never seen\na better bit of steel in my life, it takes an edge like a razor and it's\nstrong; you can cut a cigarette-paper with it and you can hew down an\noak. There is nothing to get out of order and when it is closed it might\nbe the knife a schoolboy uses to cut notches in his desk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe shut it with a click and Ashenden put it along with the revolver in\nhis pocket.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you anything else?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My hands,\" replied the Mexican with arrogance, \"but those I dare say\nthe Custom officials will not make trouble about.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden remembered the iron grip he had given him when they shook hands\nand slightly shuddered. They were large and long and smooth; there was\nnot a hair on them or on the wrists, and with the pointed, rosy,\nmanicured nails there was really something sinister about them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden and General Carmona went through the formalities at the\nfrontier independently and when they returned to their carriage Ashenden\nhanded back to his companion the revolver and the knife. He sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now I feel more comfortable. What do you say to a game of cards?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should like it,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Hairless Mexican opened his bag again and from a corner extracted a\ngreasy pack of French cards. He asked Ashenden whether he played\n<i>écarté</i> and when Ashenden told him that he did not suggested piquet.\nThis was a game that Ashenden was not unfamiliar with, so they settled\nthe stakes and began. Since both were in favour of quick action, they\nplayed the game of four hands, doubling the first and last. Ashenden had\ngood enough cards, but the General seemed notwithstanding always to have\nbetter. Ashenden kept his eyes open and he was not careless of the\npossibility that his antagonist might correct the inequalities of\nchance, but he saw nothing to suggest that everything was not above\nboard. He lost game after game. He was capoted and rubiconed. The score\nagainst him mounted up and up till he had lost something like a thousand\nfrancs, which at that time was a tidy sum. The General smoked\ninnumerable cigarettes. He made them himself with a twist of the finger,\na lick of his tongue and incredible celerity. At last he flung himself\nagainst the back of his seat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, my friend, does the British Government pay your card losses\nwhen you are on a mission?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It certainly doesn't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I think you have lost enough. If it went down on your expense\naccount I would have proposed playing till we reached Rome, but you are\nsympathetic to me. If it is your own money I do not want to win any more\nof it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe picked up the cards and put them aside. Ashenden somewhat ruefully\ntook out a number of notes and handed them to the Mexican. He counted\nthem and with his usual neatness put them carefully folded into his\npocket-book. Then, leaning forward, he patted Ashenden almost\naffectionately on the knee.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I like you, you are modest and unassuming, you have not the arrogance\nof your countrymen, and I am sure that you will take my advice in the\nspirit in which it is meant. Do not play piquet with people you don't\nknow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was somewhat mortified and perhaps his face showed it, for the\nMexican seized his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear fellow, I have not hurt your feelings? I would not do that for\nthe world. You do not play piquet worse than most piquet players. It is\nnot that. If we were going to be together longer I would teach you how\nto win at cards. One plays cards to win money and there is no sense in\nlosing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought it was only in love and war that all things were fair,\" said\nAshenden, with a chuckle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, I am glad to see you smile. That is the way to take a loss. I see\nthat you have good humour and good sense. You will go far in life. When\nI get back to Mexico and am in possession of my estates again you must\ncome and stay with me. I will treat you like a king. You shall ride my\nbest horses, we will go to bull-fights together, and if there are girls\nyou fancy you have only to say the word and you shall have them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe began telling Ashenden of the vast territories, the <i>haciendas</i> and\nthe mines in Mexico, of which he had been dispossessed. He told him of\nthe feudal state in which he lived. It did not matter whether what he\nsaid was true or not, for those sonorous phrases of his were fruity with\nthe rich-distilled perfumes of romance. He described a spacious life\nthat seemed to belong to another age and his eloquent gestures brought\nbefore the mind's eye tawny distances and vast green plantations, great\nherds of cattle and in the moonlit night the song of the blind singers\nthat melted in the air and the twanging of guitars.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Everything I lost, everything. In Paris I was driven to earn a pittance\nby giving Spanish lessons or showing Americans--<i>Americanos del Norte</i>,\nI mean--the night life of the city. I who have flung away a thousand\n<i>duros</i> on a dinner have been forced to beg my bread like a blind\nIndian. I who have taken pleasure in clasping a diamond bracelet round\nthe wrist of a beautiful woman have been forced to accept a suit of\nclothes from a hag old enough to be my mother. Patience. Man is born to\ntrouble as the sparks fly upward, but misfortune cannot last for ever.\nThe time is ripe and soon we shall strike our blow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took up the greasy pack of cards and set them out in a number of\nlittle piles.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let us see what the cards say. They never lie. Ah, if I had only had\ngreater faith in them I should have avoided the only action of my life\nthat has weighed heavily on me. My conscience is at ease. I did what any\nman would do under the circumstances, but I regret that necessity forced\nupon me an action that I would willingly have avoided.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked through the cards, set some of them on one side on a system\nAshenden did not understand, shuffled the remainder and once more put\nthem in little piles.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The cards warned me, I will never deny that, their warning was clear\nand definite. Love and a dark woman, danger, betrayal and death. It was\nas plain as the nose on your face. Any fool would have known what it\nmeant and I have been using the cards all my life. There is hardly an\naction that I make without consulting them. There are no excuses. I was\nbesotted. Ah, you of the Northern races do not know what love means, you\ndo not know how it can prevent you from sleeping, how it can take your\nappetite for food away so that you dwindle as if from a fever, you do\nnot understand what a frenzy it is so that you are like a madman and you\nwill stick at nothing to satisfy your desire. A man like me is capable\nof every folly and every crime when he is in love, <i>si, Señor</i>, and of\nheroism. He can scale mountains higher than Everest and swim seas\nbroader than the Atlantic. He is god, he is devil. Women have been my\nruin.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOnce more the Hairless Mexican glanced at the cards, took some out of\nthe little piles and left others in. He shuffled them again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have been loved by multitudes of women. I do not say it in vanity. I\noffer no explanation. It is mere matter of fact. Go to Mexico City and\nask them what they know of Manuel Carmona and of his triumphs. Ask them\nhow many women have resisted Manuel Carmona.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden, frowning a little, watched him reflectively. He wondered\nwhether R., that shrewd fellow who chose his instruments with such a\nsure instinct, had not this time made a mistake, and he was uneasy. Did\nthe Hairless Mexican really believe that he was irresistible or was he\nmerely a blatant liar? In the course of his manipulations he had thrown\nout all the cards in the pack but four, and these now lay in front of\nhim face downwards and side by side. He touched them one by one but did\nnot turn them up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is fate,\" he said, \"and no power on earth can change it. I\nhesitate. This is a moment that ever fills me with apprehension and I\nhave to steel myself to turn over the cards that may tell me that\ndisaster awaits me. I am a brave man, but sometimes I have reached this\nstage and not had the courage to look at the four vital cards.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIndeed now he eyed the backs of them with an anxiety he did not try to\nhide.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What was I saying to you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You were telling me that women found your fascinations irresistible,\"\nreplied Ashenden dryly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Once all the same I found a woman who resisted me. I saw her first in a\nhouse, a <i>casa de mujeres</i> in Mexico City, she was going down the stairs\nas I went up; she was not very beautiful, I had had a hundred more\nbeautiful, but she had something that took my fancy and I told the old\nwoman who kept the house to send her to me. You will know her when you\ngo to Mexico City; they call her La Marqueza. She said that the girl was\nnot an inmate, but came there only from time to time and had left. I\ntold her to have her there next evening and not to let her go till I\ncame. But I was delayed and when I arrived La Marqueza told me that the\ngirl had said she was not used to being kept waiting and had gone. I am\na good-natured fellow and I do not mind if women are capricious and\nteasing, that is part of their charm, so with a laugh I sent her a note\nof a hundred <i>duros</i> and promised that on the following day I would be\npunctual. But when I went, on the minute, La Marqueza handed me back my\nhundred <i>duros</i> and told me the girl did not fancy me. I laughed at her\nimpertinence. I took off the diamond ring I was wearing and told the old\nwoman to give her that and see whether it would induce her to change her\nmind. In the morning La Marqueza brought me in return for my ring--a red\ncarnation. I did not know whether to be amused or angry. I am not used\nto being thwarted in my passions, I never hesitate to spend money (what\nis it for but to squander on pretty women?), and I told La Marqueza to\ngo to the girl and say that I would give her a thousand <i>duros</i> to dine\nwith me that night. Presently she came back with the answer that the\ngirl would come on the condition that I allowed her to go home\nimmediately after dinner. I accepted with a shrug of the shoulders. I\ndid not think she was serious. I thought that she was saying that only\nto make herself more desired. She came to dinner at my house. Did I say\nshe was not beautiful? She was the most beautiful, the most exquisite\ncreature I had ever met. I was intoxicated. She had charm and she had\nwit. She had all the <i>gracia</i> of the Andalusian. In one word she was\nadorable. I asked her why she had treated me so casually and she laughed\nin my face. I laid myself out to be agreeable. I exercised all my skill.\nI surpassed myself. But when we finished dinner she rose from her seat\nand bade me good-night. I asked her where she was going. She said I had\npromised to let her go and she trusted me as a man of honour to keep my\nword. I expostulated, I reasoned, I raved, I stormed. She held me to my\nword. All I could induce her to do was to consent to dine with me the\nfollowing night on the same terms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You will think I was a fool, I was the happiest man alive; for seven\ndays I paid her a thousand silver <i>duros</i> to dine with me. Every evening\nI waited for her with my heart in my mouth, as nervous as a <i>novillero</i>\nat his first bull-fight, and every evening she played with me, laughed\nat me, coquetted with me and drove me frantic. I was madly in love with\nher. I have never loved anyone so much before or since. I could think of\nnothing else. I was distracted. I neglected everything. I am a patriot\nand I love my country. A small band of us had got together and made up\nour minds that we could no longer put up with the misrule from which we\nwere suffering. All the lucrative posts were given to other people, we\nwere being made to pay taxes as though we were tradesmen, and we were\nexposed to abominable affronts. We had money and men. Our plans were\nmade and we were ready to strike. I had an infinity of things to do,\nmeetings to go to, ammunition to get, orders to give, I was so besotted\nover this woman that I could attend to nothing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You would have thought that I should be angry with her for making such\na fool of me, me who had never known what it was not to gratify my\nsmallest whim; I did not believe that she refused me to inflame my\ndesires, I believed that she told the plain truth when she said that she\nwould not give herself to me until she loved me. She said it was for me\nto make her love me. I thought her an angel. I was ready to wait. My\npassion was so consuming that sooner or later, I felt, it must\ncommunicate itself to her; it was like a fire on the prairie that\ndevours everything around it; and at last--at last she said she loved\nme. My emotion was so terrific that I thought I should fall down and\ndie. Oh, what rapture! Oh, what madness! I would have given her\neverything I possessed in the world, I would have torn down the stars\nfrom heaven to deck her hair; I wanted to do something to prove to her\nthe extravagance of my love, I wanted to do the impossible, the\nincredible, I wanted to give her myself, my soul, my honour, all, all I\nhad and all I was; and that night when she lay in my arms I told her of\nour plot and who we were that were concerned in it. I felt her body\nstiffen with attention, I was conscious of a flicker of her eyelids,\nthere was something, I hardly knew what, the hand that stroked my face\nwas dry and cold; a sudden suspicion seized me and all at once I\nremembered what the cards had told me: love and a dark woman, danger,\nbetrayal and death. Three times they'd said it and I wouldn't heed. I\nmade no sign that I had noticed anything. She nestled up against my\nheart and told me that she was frightened to hear such things and asked\nme if So-and-so was concerned. I answered her. I wanted to make sure.\nOne after the other, with infinite cunning, between her kisses she\ncajoled me into giving every detail of the plot, and now I was certain,\nas certain as I am that you sit before me, that she was a spy. She was a\nspy of the President's and she had been set to allure me with her\ndevilish charm and now she had wormed out of me all our secrets. The\nlives of all of us were in her hands and I knew that if she left that\nroom in twenty-four hours we should be dead men. And I loved her, I\nloved her; oh, words cannot tell you the agony of desire that burned my\nheart; love like that is no pleasure; it is pain, pain, but the\nexquisite pain that transcends all pleasure. It is that heavenly anguish\nthat the saints speak of when they are seized with a divine ecstasy. I\nknew that she must not leave the room alive and I feared that if I\ndelayed my courage would fail me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I think I shall sleep,' she said.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Sleep, my dove,' I answered.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'<i>Alma de mi corazón</i>,' she called me. 'Soul of my heart.' They were\nthe last words she spoke. Those heavy lids of hers, dark like a grape\nand faintly humid, those heavy lids of hers closed over her eyes and in\na little while I knew by the regular movement of her breast against mine\nthat she slept. You see, I loved her, I could not bear that she should\nsuffer; she was a spy, yes, but my heart bade me spare her the terror of\nknowing what must happen. It is strange, I felt no anger because she had\nbetrayed me, I should have hated her because of her vileness; I could\nnot, I only felt that my soul was enveloped in night. Poor thing, poor\nthing. I could have cried in pity for her. I drew my arm very gently\nfrom around her, my left arm that was, my right was free, and raised\nmyself on my hand. But she was so beautiful, I turned my face away when\nI drew the knife with all my strength across her lovely throat. Without\nawaking she passed from sleep to death.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe stopped and stared frowning at the four cards that still lay, their\nbacks upward, waiting to be turned up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was in the cards. Why did I not take their warning? I will not look\nat them. Damn them. Take them away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith a violent gesture he swept the whole pack on to the floor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Though I am a free-thinker I had masses said for her soul.\" He leaned\nback and rolled himself a cigarette. He inhaled a long breathful of\nsmoke. He shrugged his shoulders. \"The Colonel said you were a writer.\nWhat do you write?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Stories,\" replied Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Detective stories?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why not? They are the only ones I read. If I were a writer I should\nwrite detective stories.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They are very difficult. You need an incredible amount of invention. I\ndevised a murder story once, but the murder was so ingenious that I\ncould never find a way of bringing it home to the murderer, and, after\nall, one of the conventions of the detective story is that the mystery\nshould in the end be solved and the criminal brought to justice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If your murder is as ingenious as you think the only means you have of\nproving the murderer's guilt is by the discovery of his motives. When\nonce you have found a motive the chances are that you will hit upon\nevidence that till then had escaped you. If there is no motive the most\ndamning evidence will be inconclusive. Imagine for instance that you\nwent up to a man in a lonely street on a moonless night and stabbed him\nto the heart. Who would ever think of you? But if he was your wife's\nlover, or your brother, or had cheated or insulted you, then a scrap of\npaper, a bit of string or a chance remark would be enough to hang you.\nWhat were your movements at the time he was killed? Are there not a\ndozen people who saw you before and after? But if he was a total\nstranger you would never for a moment be suspected. It was inevitable\nthat Jack the Ripper should escape unless he was caught in the act.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden had more than one reason to change the conversation. They were\nparting at Rome and he thought it necessary to come to an understanding\nwith his companion about their respective movements. The Mexican was\ngoing to Brindisi and Ashenden to Naples. He meant to lodge at the Hotel\nde Belfast, which was a large second-rate hotel near the harbour\nfrequented by commercial travellers and the thriftier kind of tripper.\nIt would be as well to let the General have the number of his room so\nthat he could come up if necessary without enquiring of the porter, and\nat the next stopping-place Ashenden got an envelope from the\nstation-buffet and made him address it in his own writing to himself at\nthe post-office in Brindisi. All Ashenden had to do then was to scribble\na number on a sheet of paper and post it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Hairless Mexican shrugged his shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To my mind all these precautions are rather childish. There is\nabsolutely no risk. But whatever happens you may be quite sure that I\nwill not compromise you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is not the sort of job which I'm very familiar with,\" said\nAshenden. \"I'm content to follow the Colonel's instructions and know no\nmore about it than it's essential I should.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite so. Should the exigencies of the situation force me to take a\ndrastic step and I get into trouble I shall of course be treated as a\npolitical prisoner. Sooner or later Italy is bound to come into the war\non the side of the Allies and I shall be released. I have considered\neverything. But I beg you very seriously to have no more anxiety about\nthe outcome of our mission than if you were going for a picnic on the\nThames.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut when at last they separated and Ashenden found himself alone in a\ncarriage on the way to Naples he heaved a great sigh of relief. He was\nglad to be rid of that chattering, hideous and fantastic creature. He\nwas gone to meet Constantine Andreadi at Brindisi and if half of what he\nhad told Ashenden was true, Ashenden could not but congratulate himself\nthat he did not stand in the Greek spy's shoes. He wondered what sort of\na man he was. There was a grimness in the notion of his coming across\nthe blue Ionian, with his confidential papers and his dangerous secrets,\nall unconscious of the noose into which he was putting his head. Well,\nthat was war, and only fools thought it could be waged with kid gloves\non.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden arrived in Naples and, having taken a room at the hotel, wrote\nits number on a sheet of paper in block letters and posted it to the\nHairless Mexican. He went to the British Consulate, where R. had\narranged to send any instructions he might have for him, and found that\nthey knew about him and everything was in order. Then he put aside these\nmatters and made up his mind to amuse himself. Here in the South the\nspring was well advanced and in the busy streets the sun was hot.\nAshenden knew Naples pretty well. The Piazza di San Ferdinando, with its\nbustle, the Piazza del Plebiscito, with its handsome church, stirred in\nhis heart pleasant recollections. The Strada di Chiara was as noisy as\never. He stood at corners and looked up the narrow alleys that climbed\nthe hill precipitously, those alleys of high houses with the washing set\nout to dry on lines across the street like pennants flying to mark a\nfeast-day: and he sauntered along the shore, looking at the burnished\nsea with Capri faintly outlined against the bay, till he came to\nPosilippo, where there was an old, rambling and bedraggled <i>palazzo</i> in\nwhich in his youth he had spent many a romantic hour. He observed the\ncurious little pain with which the memories of the past wrung his\nheart-strings. Then he took a fly drawn by a small and scraggy pony and\nrattled back over the stones to the <i>Galleria</i>, where he sat in the cool\nand drank an americano and looked at the people who loitered there,\ntalking, for ever talking with vivacious gestures, and, exercising his\nfancy, sought from their appearance to divine their reality.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor three days Ashenden led the idle life that fitted so well the\nfantastical, untidy and genial city. He did nothing from morning till\nnight but wander at random, looking, not with the eye of the tourist who\nseeks for what ought to be seen, nor with the eye of the writer who\nlooks for his own (seeing in a sunset a melodious phrase or in a face\nthe inkling of a character), but with that of the tramp to whom whatever\nhappens is absolute. He went to the museum to look at the statue of\nAgrippina the Younger, which he had particular reasons for remembering\nwith affection, and took the opportunity to see once more the Titian and\nthe Brueghel in the picture gallery. But he always came back to the\nchurch of Santa Chiara. Its grace, its gaiety, the airy persiflage with\nwhich it seemed to treat religion and at the back of this its sensual\nemotion; its extravagance, its elegance of line; to Ashenden it seemed\nto express, as it were in one absurd and grandiloquent metaphor, the\nsunny, dusty, lovely city and its bustling inhabitants. It said that\nlife was charming and sad; it's a pity one hadn't any money, but money\nwasn't everything, and anyway why bother when we are here to-day and\ngone to-morrow, and it was all very exciting and amusing, and after all\nwe must make the best of things: <i>facciamo una piccola combinazione</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut on the fourth morning, when Ashenden, having just stepped out of his\nbath, was trying to dry himself on a towel that absorbed no moisture,\nhis door was quickly opened and a man slipped into his room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What d'you want?\" cried Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's all right. Don't you know me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good Lord, it's the Mexican. What have you done to yourself?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had changed his wig and wore now a black one, close-cropped, that\nfitted on his head like a cap. It entirely altered the look of him and\nthough this was still odd enough, it was quite different from that which\nhe had borne before. He wore a shabby grey suit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can only stop a minute. He's getting shaved.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden felt his cheeks suddenly redden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You found him then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That wasn't difficult. He was the only Greek passenger on the ship. I\nwent on board when she got in and asked for a friend who had sailed from\nthe Piræus. I said I had come to meet a Mr. George Diogenidis. I\npretended to be much puzzled at his not coming, and I got into\nconversation with Andreadi. He's travelling under a false name. He calls\nhimself Lombardos. I followed him when he landed and do you know the\nfirst thing he did? He went into a barber's and had his beard shaved.\nWhat do you think of that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing. Anyone might have his beard shaved.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is not what I think. He wanted to change his appearance. Oh, he's\ncunning. I admire the Germans, they leave nothing to chance, he's got\nhis whole story pat, but I'll tell you that in a minute.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, you've changed your appearance too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, yes, this is a wig I'm wearing; it makes a difference, doesn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should never have known you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One has to take precautions. We are bosom friends. We had to spend the\nday in Brindisi and he cannot speak Italian. He was glad to have me help\nhim and we travelled up together. I have brought him to this hotel. He\nsays he is going to Rome to-morrow, but I shall not let him out of my\nsight; I do not want him to give me the slip. He says that he wants to\nsee Naples and I have offered to show him everything there is to see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why isn't he going to Rome to-day?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is part of the story. He pretends he is a Greek business man who\nhas made money during the war. He says he was the owner of two coasting\nsteamers and has just sold them. Now he means to go to Paris and have\nhis fling. He says he has wanted to go to Paris all his life and at last\nhas the chance. He is close. I tried to get him to talk. I told him I\nwas a Spaniard and had been to Brindisi to arrange communications with\nTurkey about war material. He listened to me and I saw he was\ninterested, but he told me nothing and of course I did not think it wise\nto press him. He has the papers on his person.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How do you know?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He is not anxious about his grip, but he feels every now and then round\nhis middle, they're either in a belt or in the lining of his vest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why the devil did you bring him to this hotel?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought it would be more convenient. We may want to search his\nluggage.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you staying here too?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I am not such a fool as that. I told him I was going to Rome by the\nnight train and would not take a room. But I must go, I promised to meet\nhim outside the barber's in fifteen minutes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where shall I find you to-night if I want you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden for an instant eyed the Hairless Mexican, then with a slight\nfrown looked away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall spend the evening in my room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well. Will you just see that there's nobody in the passage?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden opened the door and looked out. He saw no one. The hotel in\npoint of fact at that season was nearly empty. There were few foreigners\nin Naples and trade was bad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's all right,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Hairless Mexican walked boldly out. Ashenden closed the door behind\nhim. He shaved and slowly dressed. The sun was shining as brightly as\nusual on the square and the people who passed, the shabby little\ncarriages with their scrawny horses, had the same air as before, but\nthey did not any longer fill Ashenden with gaiety. He was not\ncomfortable. He went out and called as was his habit at the Consulate to\nask if there was a telegram for him. Nothing. Then he went to Cook's and\nlooked out the trains to Rome: there was one soon after midnight and\nanother at five in the morning. He wished he could catch the first. He\ndid not know what were the Mexican's plans; if he really wanted to get\nto Cuba he would do well to make his way to Spain, and, glancing at the\nnotices in the office, Ashenden saw that next day there was a ship\nsailing from Naples to Barcelona.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was bored with Naples. The glare in the streets tired his eyes,\nthe dust was intolerable, the noise was deafening. He went to the\n<i>Galleria</i> and had a drink. In the afternoon he went to a cinema. Then,\ngoing back to his hotel, he told the clerk that since he was starting so\nearly in the morning he preferred to pay his bill at once, and he took\nhis luggage to the station, leaving in his room only a despatch-case in\nwhich were the printed part of his code and a book or two. He dined.\nThen returning to the hotel he sat down to wait for the Hairless\nMexican. He could not conceal from himself the fact that he was\nexceedingly nervous. He began to read, but the book was tiresome, and he\ntried another; his attention wandered and he glanced at his watch. It\nwas desperately early; he took up his book again, making up his mind\nthat he would not look at his watch till he had read thirty pages, but\nthough he ran his eyes conscientiously down one page after another he\ncould not tell more than vaguely what it was he read. He looked at the\ntime again. Good God, it was only half-past ten. He wondered where the\nHairless Mexican was, and what he was doing; he was afraid he would make\na mess of things. It was a horrible business. Then it struck him that he\nhad better shut the window and draw the curtains. He smoked innumerable\ncigarettes. He looked at his watch and it was a quarter past eleven. A\nthought struck him and his heart began to beat against his chest; out of\ncuriosity he counted his pulse and was surprised to find that it was\nnormal. Though it was a warm night and the room was stuffy his hands and\nfeet were icy. What a nuisance it was, he reflected irritably, to have\nan imagination that conjured up pictures of things that you didn't in\nthe least want to see! From his standpoint as a writer he had often\nconsidered murder and his mind went to that fearful description of one\nin <i>Crime and Punishment</i>. He did not want to think of this topic, but\nit forced itself upon him; his book dropped to his knees and staring at\nthe wall in front of him (it had a brown wall-paper with a pattern of\ndingy roses) he asked himself how, if one had to, one would commit a\nmurder in Naples. Of course there was the Villa, the great leafy garden\nfacing the bay in which stood the aquarium; that was deserted at night\nand very dark; things happened there that did not bear the light of day\nand prudent persons after dusk avoided its sinister paths. Beyond\nPosilippo the road was very solitary and there were byways that led up\nthe hill in which by night you would never meet a soul, but how would\nyou induce a man who had any nerves to go there? You might suggest a row\nin the bay, but the boatman who hired the boat would see you; it was\ndoubtful indeed if he would let you go on the water alone; there were\ndisreputable hotels down by the harbour where no questions were asked of\npersons who arrived late at night without luggage; but here again the\nwaiter who showed you your room had the chance of a good look at you and\nyou had on entering to sign an elaborate questionnaire.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden looked once more at the time. He was very tired. He sat now not\neven trying to read, his mind a blank.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen the door opened softly and he sprang to his feet. His flesh crept.\nThe Hairless Mexican stood before him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did I startle you?\" he asked smiling. \"I thought you would prefer me\nnot to knock.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did anyone see you come in?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was let in by the night-watchman; he was asleep when I rang and\ndidn't even look at me. I'm sorry I'm so late, but I had to change.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Hairless Mexican wore now the clothes he had travelled down in and\nhis fair wig. It was extraordinary how different he looked. He was\nbigger and more flamboyant; the very shape of his face was altered. His\neyes were shining and he seemed in excellent spirits. He gave Ashenden a\nglance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How white you are, my friend! Surely you're not nervous?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you got the documents?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. He hadn't got them on him. This is all he had.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put down on the table a bulky pocket-book and a passport.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want them,\" said Ashenden quickly. \"Take them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith a shrug of the shoulders the Hairless Mexican put the things back\nin his pocket.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What was in his belt? You said he kept feeling round his middle.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Only money. I've looked through the pocket-book. It contains nothing\nbut private letters and photographs of women. He must have locked the\ndocuments in his grip before coming out with me this evening.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damn,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got the key of his room. We'd better go and look through his\nluggage.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden felt a sensation of sickness in the pit of his stomach. He\nhesitated. The Mexican smiled not unkindly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no risk, <i>amigo</i>,\" he said, as though he were reassuring a\nsmall boy, \"but if you don't feel happy, I'll go alone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I'll come with you,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no one awake in the hotel and Mr. Andreadi won't disturb us.\nTake off your shoes if you like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden did not answer. He frowned because he noticed that his hands\nwere slightly trembling. He unlaced his shoes and slipped them off. The\nMexican did the same.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd better go first,\" he said. \"Turn to the left and go straight\nalong the corridor. It's number thirty-eight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden opened the door and stepped out. The passage was dimly lit. It\nexasperated him to feel so nervous when he could not but be aware that\nhis companion was perfectly at ease. When they reached the door the\nHairless Mexican inserted the key, turned the lock and went in. He\nswitched on the light. Ashenden followed him and closed the door. He\nnoticed that the shutters were shut.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now we're all right. We can take our time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took a bunch of keys out of his pocket, tried one or two and at last\nhit upon the right one. The suitcase was filled with clothes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Cheap clothes,\" said the Mexican contemptuously as he took them out.\n\"My own principle is that it's always cheaper in the end to buy the\nbest. After all one is a gentleman or one isn't a gentleman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you obliged to talk?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A spice of danger affects people in different ways. It only excites me,\nbut it puts you in a bad temper, <i>amigo</i>.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see, I'm scared and you're not,\" replied Ashenden with candour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's merely a matter of nerves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMeanwhile he felt the clothes, rapidly but with care, as he took them\nout. There were no papers of any sort in the suitcase. Then he took out\nhis knife and slit the lining. It was a cheap piece and the lining was\ngummed to the material of which the suitcase was made. There was no\npossibility of anything being concealed in it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're not here. They must be hidden in the room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you sure he didn't deposit them in some office? At one of the\nconsulates, for example?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was never out of my sight for a moment except when he was getting\nshaved.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Hairless Mexican opened the drawers and the cupboard. There was no\ncarpet on the floor. He looked under the bed, in it, and under the\nmattress. His dark eyes shot up and down the room, looking for a\nhiding-place, and Ashenden felt that nothing escaped him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps he left them in charge of the clerk downstairs?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have known it. And he wouldn't dare. They're not here. I can't\nunderstand it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked about the room irresolutely. He frowned in the attempt to\nguess at a solution of the mystery.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let's get out of here,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In a minute.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Mexican went down on his knees, quickly and neatly folded the\nclothes, and packed them up again. He locked the bag and stood up. Then,\nputting out the light, he slowly opened the door and looked out. He\nbeckoned to Ashenden and slipped into the passage. When Ashenden had\nfollowed him he stopped and locked the door, put the key in his pocket\nand walked with Ashenden to his room. When they were inside it and the\nbolt drawn Ashenden wiped his clammy hands and his forehead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank God, we're out of that!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There wasn't really the smallest danger. But what are we to do now? The\nColonel will be angry that the papers haven't been found.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm taking the five o'clock train to Rome. I shall wire for\ninstructions there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well, I will come with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have thought it would suit you better to get out of the\ncountry more quickly. There's a boat to-morrow that goes to Barcelona.\nWhy don't you take that and if necessary I can come to see you there?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Hairless Mexican gave a little smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see that you are anxious to be rid of me. Well, I won't thwart a wish\nthat your inexperience in these matters excuses. I will go to Barcelona.\nI have a visa for Spain.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden looked at his watch. It was a little after two. He had nearly\nthree hours to wait. His companion comfortably rolled himself a\ncigarette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you say to a little supper?\" he asked. \"I'm as hungry as a\nwolf.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe thought of food sickened Ashenden, but he was terribly thirsty. He\ndid not want to go out with the Hairless Mexican, but neither did he\nwant to stay in that hotel by himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where could one go at this hour?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come along with me. I'll find you a place.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden put on his hat and took his despatch-case in his hand. They\nwent downstairs. In the hall the porter was sleeping soundly on a\nmattress on the floor. As they passed the desk, walking softly in order\nnot to wake him, Ashenden noticed in the pigeon-hole belonging to his\nroom a letter. He took it out and saw that it was addressed to him. They\ntiptoed out of the hotel and shut the door behind them. Then they walked\nquickly away. Stopping after a hundred yards or so under a lamp-post\nAshenden took the letter out of his pocket and read it; it came from the\nConsulate and said: <i>The enclosed telegram arrived to-night and in case\nit is urgent I am sending it round to your hotel by messenger.</i> It had\napparently been left some time before midnight while Ashenden was\nsitting in his room. He opened the telegram and saw that it was in code.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it'll have to wait,\" he said, putting it back in his pocket.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Hairless Mexican walked as though he knew his way through the\ndeserted streets and Ashenden walked by his side. At last they came to a\ntavern in a blind alley, noisome and evil, and this the Mexican entered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not the Ritz,\" he said, \"but at this hour of the night it's only\nin a place like this that we stand a chance of getting something to\neat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden found himself in a long sordid room at one end of which a\nwizened young man sat at a piano; there were tables standing out from\nthe wall on each side and against them benches. A number of persons, men\nand women, were sitting about. They were drinking beer and wine. The\nwomen were old, painted, and hideous; and their harsh gaiety was at once\nnoisy and lifeless. When Ashenden and the Hairless Mexican came in they\nall stared and when they sat down at one of the tables Ashenden looked\naway in order not to meet the leering eyes, just ready to break into a\nsmile, that sought his insinuatingly. The wizened pianist strummed a\ntune and several couples got up and began to dance. Since there were not\nenough men to go round some of the women danced together. The General\nordered two plates of spaghetti and a bottle of Capri wine. When the\nwine was brought he drank a glassful greedily and then waiting for the\n<i>pasta</i> eyed the women who were sitting at the other tables.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you dance?\" he asked Ashenden. \"I'm going to ask one of these girls\nto have a turn with me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got up and Ashenden watched him go up to one who had at least\nflashing eyes and white teeth to recommend her; she rose and he put his\narm round her. He danced well. Ashenden saw him begin talking; the woman\nlaughed and presently the look of indifference with which she had\naccepted his offer changed to one of interest. Soon they were chatting\ngaily. The dance came to an end and putting her back at her table he\nreturned to Ashenden and drank another glass of wine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you think of my girl?\" he asked. \"Not bad, is she? It does one\ngood to dance. Why don't you ask one of them? This is a nice place, is\nit not? You can always trust me to find anything like this. I have an\ninstinct.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe pianist started again. The woman looked at the Hairless Mexican and\nwhen with his thumb he pointed to the floor she jumped up with alacrity.\nHe buttoned up his coat, arched his back and standing up by the side of\nthe table waited for her to come to him. He swung her off, talking,\nsmiling, and already he was on familiar terms with everyone in the room.\nIn fluent Italian, with his Spanish accent, he exchanged badinage with\none and the other. They laughed at his sallies. Then the waiter brought\ntwo heaped platefuls of macaroni and when the Mexican saw them he\nstopped dancing without ceremony and, allowing his partner to get back\nto her table as she chose, hurried to his meal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm ravenous,\" he said. \"And yet I ate a good dinner. Where did you\ndine? You're going to eat some macaroni, aren't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have no appetite,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he began to eat and to his surprise found that he was hungry. The\nHairless Mexican ate with huge mouthfuls, enjoying himself vastly; his\neyes shone and he was loquacious. The woman he had danced with had in\nthat short time told him all about herself and he repeated now to\nAshenden what she had said. He stuffed huge pieces of bread into his\nmouth. He ordered another bottle of wine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wine?\" he cried scornfully. \"Wine is not a drink, only champagne; it\ndoes not even quench your thirst. Well, <i>amigo</i>, are you feeling\nbetter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm bound to say I am,\" smiled Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Practice, that is all you want, practice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe stretched out his hand to pat Ashenden on the arm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's that?\" cried Ashenden with a start. \"What's that stain on your\ncuff?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Hairless Mexican gave his sleeve a glance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That? Nothing. It's only blood. I had a little accident and cut\nmyself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was silent. His eyes sought the clock that hung over the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you anxious about your train? Let me have one more dance and then\nI'll accompany you to the station.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Mexican got up and with his sublime self-assurance seized in his\narms the woman who sat nearest to him and danced away with her. Ashenden\nwatched him moodily. He was a monstrous, terrible figure with that blond\nwig and his hairless face, but he moved with a matchless grace; his feet\nwere small and seemed to hold the ground like the pads of a cat or a\ntiger; his rhythm was wonderful and you could not but see that the\nbedizened creature he danced with was intoxicated by his gestures. There\nwas music in his toes and in the long arms that held her so firmly, and\nthere was music in those long legs that seemed to move strangely from\nthe hips. Sinister and grotesque though he was, there was in him now a\nfeline elegance, even something of beauty, and you felt a secret,\nshameful fascination. To Ashenden he suggested one of those sculptures\nof the pre-Aztec hewers of stone, in which there is barbarism and\nvitality, something terrible and cruel, and yet withal a brooding and\nsignificant loveliness. All the same he would gladly have left him to\nfinish the night by himself in that sordid dance-hall, but he knew that\nhe must have a business conversation with him. He did not look forward\nto it without misgiving. He had been instructed to give Manuel Carmona\ncertain sums in return for certain documents. Well, the documents were\nnot forthcoming, and as for the rest--Ashenden knew nothing about that;\nit was no business of his. The Hairless Mexican waved gaily as he passed\nhim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will come the moment the music stops. Pay the bill and then I shall\nbe ready.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden wished he could have seen into his mind. He could not even make\na guess at its workings. Then the Mexican, with his scented handkerchief\nwiping the sweat from his brow, came back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you had a good time, General?\" Ashenden asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I always have a good time. Poor white trash, but what do I care? I like\nto feel the body of a woman in my arms and see her eyes grow languid and\nher lips part as her desire for me melts the marrow in her bones like\nbutter in the sun. Poor white trash, but women.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey sallied forth. The Mexican proposed that they should walk and in\nthat quarter, at that hour, there would have been little chance of\nfinding a cab; but the sky was starry. It was a summer night and the air\nwas still. The silence walked beside them like the ghost of a dead man.\nWhen they neared the station the houses seemed on a sudden to take on a\ngreyer, more rigid line, and you felt that the dawn was at hand. A\nlittle shiver trembled through the night. It was a moment of\napprehension and the soul for an instant was anxious; it was as though,\ninherited down the years in their countless millions, it felt a witless\nfear that perhaps another day would not break. But they entered the\nstation and the night once more enwrapped them. One or two porters\nlolled about like stage-hands after the curtain has rung down and the\nscene is struck. Two soldiers in dim uniforms stood motionless.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe waiting-room was empty, but Ashenden and the Hairless Mexican went\nto sit in the most retired part of it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I still have an hour before my train goes. I'll just see what this\ncable's about.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took it out of his pocket and from the despatch-case got his code. He\nwas not then using a very elaborate one. It was in two parts, one\ncontained in a slim book and the other, given him on a sheet of paper\nand destroyed by him before he left allied territory, committed to\nmemory. Ashenden put on his spectacles and set to work. The Hairless\nMexican sat in a corner of the seat, rolling himself cigarettes and\nsmoking; he sat there placidly, taking no notice of what Ashenden did,\nand enjoyed his well-earned repose. Ashenden deciphered the groups of\nnumbers one by one and as he got it out jotted down each word on a piece\nof paper. His method was to abstract his mind from the sense till he had\nfinished, since he had discovered that if you took notice of the words\nas they came along you often jumped to a conclusion and sometimes were\nled into error. So he translated quite mechanically, without paying\nattention to the words as he wrote them one after the other. When at\nlast he had done he read the complete message. It ran as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <i>Constantine Andreadi has been detained by illness at Piræus. He\n    will be unable to sail. Return Geneva and await instructions.</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nAt first Ashenden could not understand. He read it again. He shook from\nhead to foot. Then, for once robbed of his self-possession, he blurted\nout, in a hoarse, agitated and furious whisper:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You bloody fool, you've killed the wrong man.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was in the habit of asserting that he was never bored. It was\none of his notions that only such persons were as had no resources in\nthemselves and it was but the stupid that depended on the outside world\nfor their amusement. Ashenden had no illusions about himself and such\nsuccess in current letters as had come to him had left his head\nunturned. He distinguished acutely between fame and the notoriety that\nrewards the author of a successful novel or a popular play; and he was\nindifferent to this except in so far as it was attended with tangible\nbenefits. He was perfectly ready to take advantage of his familiar name\nto get a better stateroom in a ship than he had paid for, and if a\nCustoms-house officer passed his luggage unopened because he had read\nhis short stories Ashenden was pleased to admit that the pursuit of\nliterature had its compensations. He sighed when eager young students of\nthe drama sought to discuss its technique with him, and when gushing\nladies tremulously whispered in his ear their admiration of his books he\noften wished he was dead. But he thought himself intelligent and so it\nwas absurd that he should be bored. It was a fact that he could talk\nwith interest to persons commonly thought so excruciatingly dull that\ntheir fellows fled from them as though they owed them money. It may be\nthat here he was but indulging the professional instinct that was seldom\ndormant in him; they, his raw material, did not bore him any more than\nfossils bore the geologist. And now he had everything that a reasonable\nman could want for his entertainment. He had pleasant rooms in a good\nhotel and Geneva is one of the most agreeable cities in Europe to live\nin. He hired a boat and rowed on the lake or hired a horse and trotted\nsedately, for in that neat and orderly canton it is difficult to find a\nstretch of turf where you can have a good gallop, along the macadamised\nroads in the environs of the town. He wandered on foot about its old\nstreets, trying among those grey stone houses, so quiet and dignified,\nto recapture the spirit of a past age. He read again with delight\nRousseau's <i>Confessions</i>, and for the second or third time tried in vain\nto get on with <i>La Nouvelle Héloïse</i>. He wrote. He knew few people, for\nit was his business to keep in the background, but he had picked up a\nchatting acquaintance with several persons living in his hotel and he\nwas not lonely. His life was sufficiently filled, it was varied, and\nwhen he had nothing else to do he could enjoy his own reflections; it\nwas absurd to think that under these circumstances he could possibly be\nbored, and yet, like a little lonely cloud in the sky, he did see in the\noffing the possibility of boredom. There is a story that Louis XIV,\nhaving summoned a courtier to attend him on a ceremonial occasion, found\nhimself ready to go as the courtier appeared; he turned to him and with\nicy majesty said, <i>J'ai failli attendre</i>, of which the only translation\nI can give, but a poor one, is, I have but just escaped waiting: so\nAshenden might have admitted that he now but just escaped being bored.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt might be, he mused, as he rode along the lake on a dappled horse with\na great rump and a short neck, like one of those prancing steeds that\nyou see in old pictures, but this horse never pranced and he needed a\nfirm jab with the spur to break even into a smart trot--it might be, he\nmused, that the great chiefs of the secret service in their London\noffices, their hands on the throttle of this great machine, led a life\nfull of excitement; they moved their pieces here and there, they saw the\npattern woven by the multitudinous threads (Ashenden was lavish with his\nmetaphors), they made a picture out of the various pieces of the jigsaw\npuzzle; but it must be confessed that for the small fry like himself to\nbe a member of the secret service was not as adventurous an affair as\nthe public thought. Ashenden's official existence was as orderly and\nmonotonous as a city clerk's. He saw his spies at stated intervals and\npaid them their wages; when he could get hold of a new one he engaged\nhim, gave him his instructions and sent him off to Germany; he waited\nfor the information that came through and despatched it; he went into\nFrance once a week to confer with his colleague over the frontier and to\nreceive his orders from London; he visited the market-place on\nmarket-day to get any message the old butter-woman had brought him from\nthe other side of the lake; he kept his eyes and ears open; and he wrote\nlong reports which he was convinced no one read, till having\ninadvertently slipped a jest into one of them he received a sharp\nreproof for his levity. The work he was doing was evidently necessary,\nbut it could not be called anything but monotonous. At one moment for\nsomething better to do he had considered the possibility of a flirtation\nwith the Baroness von Higgins. He was confident now that she was an\nagent in the service of the Austrian Government and he looked forward to\na certain entertainment in the duel he foresaw. It would be amusing to\nset his wits against hers. He was quite aware that she would lay snares\nfor him and to avoid them would give him something to keep his mind from\nrusting. He found her not unwilling to play the game. She wrote him\ngushing little notes when he sent her flowers. She went for a row with\nhim on the lake and letting her long white hand drag through the water\ntalked of Love and hinted at a Broken Heart. They dined together and\nwent to see a performance, in French and in prose, of <i>Romeo and\nJuliet</i>. Ashenden had not made up his mind how far he was prepared to go\nwhen he received a sharp note from R. to ask him what he was playing at:\ninformation \"had come to hand\" that he (Ashenden) was much in the\nsociety of a woman calling herself the Baroness de Higgins, who was\nknown to be an agent of the Central Powers and it was most undesirable\nthat he should be on any terms with her but those of frigid courtesy.\nAshenden shrugged his shoulders. R. did not think him as clever as he\nthought himself. But he was interested to discover, what he had not\nknown before, that there was someone in Geneva part of whose duties at\nall events was to keep an eye on him. There was evidently someone who\nhad orders to see that he did not neglect his work or get into mischief.\nAshenden was not a little amused. What a shrewd, unscrupulous old thing\nwas R.! He took no risks; he trusted nobody; he made use of his\ninstruments, but, high or low, had no opinion of them. Ashenden looked\nabout to see whether he could spot the person who had told R. what he\nwas doing. He wondered if it was one of the waiters in the hotel. He\nknew that R. had a great belief in waiters; they had the chance of\nseeing so much and could so easily get into places where information was\nlying about to be picked up. He even wondered whether R. had got his\nnews from the Baroness herself; it would not be so strange if after all\nshe was employed by the secret service of one of the Allied nations.\nAshenden continued to be polite to the Baroness, but ceased to be\nattentive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned his horse and trotted gently back to Geneva. An ostler from\nthe riding-stables was waiting at the hotel door and slipping out of the\nsaddle Ashenden went into the hotel. At the desk the porter handed him a\ntelegram. It was to the following effect:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <i>Aunt Maggie not at all well. Staying at Hôtel Lotti, Paris. If\n    possible please go and see her.  Raymond.</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nRaymond was one of R.'s facetious <i>noms de guerre</i>, and since Ashenden\nwas not so fortunate as to possess an Aunt Maggie he concluded that this\nwas an order to go to Paris. It had always seemed to Ashenden that R.\nhad spent much of his spare time in reading detective fiction and\nespecially when he was in a good humour he found a fantastic pleasure in\naping the style of the shilling shocker. If R. was in a good humour it\nmeant that he was about to bring off a coup, for when he had brought one\noff he was filled with depression and then vented his spleen on his\nsubordinates.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden, leaving his telegram with deliberate carelessness on the desk,\nasked at what time the express left for Paris. He glanced at the clock\nto see whether he had time to get to the Consulate before it closed and\nsecure his visa. When he went upstairs to fetch his passport the porter,\njust as the lift doors were closed, called him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Monsieur</i> has forgotten his telegram,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How stupid of me,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow Ashenden knew that if an Austrian baroness by any chance wondered\nwhy he had so suddenly gone to Paris she would discover that it was\nowing to the indisposition of a female relative. In those troublous\ntimes of war it was just as well that everything should be clear and\nabove board. He was known at the French Consulate and so lost little\ntime there. He had told the porter to get him a ticket and on his return\nto the hotel bathed and changed. He was not a little excited at the\nprospect of this unexpected jaunt. He liked the journey. He slept well\nin a sleeping-car and was not disturbed if a sudden jolt waked him; it\nwas pleasant to lie a while smoking a cigarette and to feel oneself in\none's little cabin so enchantingly alone; the rhythmical sound as the\nwheels rattled over the points was an agreeable background to the\npattern of one's reflections, and to speed through the open country and\nthe night made one feel like a star speeding through space. And at the\nend of the journey was the unknown.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ashenden arrived in Paris it was chilly and a light rain was\nfalling; he felt unshaved and he wanted a bath and clean linen; but he\nwas in excellent spirits. He telephoned from the station to R. and asked\nhow Aunt Maggie was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm glad to see that your affection for her was great enough to allow\nyou to waste no time in getting here,\" answered R., with the ghost of a\nchuckle in his voice. \"She's very low, but I'm sure it'll do her good to\nsee you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden reflected that this was the mistake the amateur humorist, as\nopposed to the professional, so often made; when he made a joke he\nharped on it. The relations of the joker to his joke should be as quick\nand desultory as those of a bee to its flower. He should make his joke\nand pass on. There is of course no harm if, like the bee approaching the\nflower, he buzzes a little; for it is just as well to announce to a\nthick-headed world that a joke is intended. But Ashenden, unlike most\nprofessional humorists, had a kindly tolerance for other people's humour\nand now he answered R. on his own lines.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When would she like to see me, do you think?\" he asked. \"Give her my\nlove, won't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow R. quite distinctly chuckled. Ashenden sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She'll want to titivate a little before you come, I expect. You know\nwhat she is, she likes to make the best of herself. Shall we say\nhalf-past ten, and then when you've had a talk to her we might go out\nand lunch together somewhere.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right,\" said Ashenden. \"I'll come to the Lotti at ten-thirty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ashenden, clean and refreshed, reached the hotel an orderly whom he\nrecognised met him in the hall and took him up to R.'s apartment. He\nopened the door and showed Ashenden in. R. was standing with his back to\na bright log fire dictating to his secretary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sit down,\" said R. and went on with his dictation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a nicely furnished sitting-room and a bunch of roses in a bowl\ngave the impression of a woman's hand. On a large table was a litter of\npapers. R. looked older than when last Ashenden had seen him. His thin\nyellow face was more lined and his hair was greyer. The work was telling\non him. He did not spare himself. He was up at seven every morning and\nhe worked late into the night. His uniform was spick and span, but he\nwore it shabbily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That'll do,\" he said. \"Take all this stuff away and get on with the\ntyping. I'll sign before I go out to lunch.\" Then he turned to the\norderly. \"I don't want to be disturbed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe secretary, a second-lieutenant in the thirties, obviously a civilian\nwith a temporary commission, gathered up a mass of papers and left the\nroom. As the orderly was following, R. said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wait outside. If I want you I'll call.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen they were alone R. turned to Ashenden with what for him was\ncordiality.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have a nice journey up?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you think of this?\" he asked, looking round the room. \"Not bad,\nis it? I never see why one shouldn't do what one can to mitigate the\nhardships of war.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhile he was idly chatting R. gazed at Ashenden with a singular fixity.\nThe stare of those pale eyes of his, too closely set together, gave you\nthe impression that he looked at your naked brain and had a very poor\nopinion of what he saw there. R. in rare moments of expansion made no\nsecret of the fact that he looked upon his fellow-men as fools or\nknaves. That was one of the obstacles he had to contend with in his\ncalling. On the whole he preferred them knaves; you knew then what you\nwere up against and could take steps accordingly. He was a professional\nsoldier and had spent his career in India and the Colonies. At the\noutbreak of the war he was stationed in Jamaica and someone in the War\nOffice who had had dealings with him, remembering him, brought him over\nand put him in the Intelligence Department. His astuteness was so great\nthat he very soon occupied an important post. He had an immense energy\nand a gift for organisation, no scruples, but resource, courage and\ndetermination. He had perhaps but one weakness. Throughout his life he\nhad never come in contact with persons, especially women, of any social\nconsequence; the only women he had ever known were the wives of his\nbrother officers, the wives of government officials and of business men;\nand when, coming to London at the beginning of the war, his work brought\nhim into contact with brilliant, beautiful and distinguished women he\nwas unduly dazzled. They made him feel shy, but he cultivated their\nsociety; he became quite a lady's man, and to Ashenden, who knew more\nabout him than R. suspected, that bowl of roses told a story.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden knew that R. had not sent for him to talk about the weather and\nthe crops, and wondered when he was coming to the point. He did not\nwonder long.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've been doing pretty well in Geneva,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm glad you think that, sir,\" replied Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSuddenly R. looked very cold and stern. He had done with idle talk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got a job for you,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden made no reply, but he felt a happy little flutter somewhere\nabout the pit of his stomach.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you ever heard of Chandra Lal?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA frown of impatience for an instant darkened the Colonel's brow. He\nexpected his subordinates to know everything he wished them to know.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where have you been living all these years?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At 36, Chesterfield Street, Mayfair,\" returned Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe shadow of a smile crossed R.'s yellow face. The somewhat impertinent\nreply was after his own sardonic heart. He went over to the big table\nand opened a despatch-case that lay upon it. He took out a photograph\nand handed it to Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo Ashenden, unused to Oriental faces, it looked like any of a hundred\nIndians that he had seen. It might have been the photograph of one or\nother of the rajahs who come periodically to England and are portrayed\nin the illustrated papers. It showed a fat-faced, swarthy man, with full\nlips and a fleshy nose; his hair was black, thick and straight, and his\nvery large eyes even in the photograph were liquid and cow-like. He\nlooked ill-at-ease in European clothes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Here he is in native dress,\" said R., giving Ashenden another\nphotograph.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis was full-length, whereas the first had shown only the head and\nshoulders, and it had evidently been taken some years earlier. He was\nthinner and his great, serious eyes seemed to devour his face. It was\ndone by a native photographer in Calcutta and the surroundings were\nnaïvely grotesque. Chandra Lal stood against a background on which had\nbeen painted a pensive palm tree and a view of the sea. One hand rested\non a heavily carved table on which was a rubber-plant in a flower-pot.\nBut in his turban and long, pale tunic he was not without dignity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What d'you think of him?\" asked R.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have said he was a man not without personality. There is a\ncertain force there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Here's his dossier. Read it, will you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. gave Ashenden a couple of typewritten pages and Ashenden sat down. R.\nput on his spectacles and began to read the letters that awaited his\nsignature. Ashenden skimmed the report and then read it a second time\nmore attentively. It appeared that Chandra Lal was a dangerous agitator.\nHe was a lawyer by profession, but had taken up politics and was\nbitterly hostile to the British rule in India. He was a partisan of\narmed force and had been on more than one occasion responsible for riots\nin which life had been lost. He was once arrested, tried and sentenced\nto two years' imprisonment; but he was at liberty at the beginning of\nthe war and seizing his opportunity began to foment active rebellion. He\nwas at the heart of plots to embarrass the British in India and so\nprevent them from transferring troops to the seat of war and with the\nhelp of immense sums given to him by German agents he was able to cause\na great deal of trouble. He was concerned in two or three bomb outrages\nwhich, though beyond killing a few innocent bystanders they did little\nharm, yet shook the nerves of the public and so damaged its morale. He\nevaded all attempts to arrest him, his activity was formidable, he was\nhere and there; but the police could never lay hands on him, and they\nonly learned that he had been in some city when, having done his work,\nhe had left it. At last a high reward was offered for his arrest on a\ncharge of murder, but he escaped the country, got to America, from there\nwent to Sweden and eventually reached Berlin. Here he busied himself\nwith schemes to create disaffection among the native troops that had\nbeen brought to Europe. All this was narrated dryly, without comment or\nexplanation, but from the very frigidity of the narrative you got a\nsense of mystery and adventure, of hairbreadth escapes and dangers\ndangerously encountered. The report ended as follows:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"C. has a wife in India and two children. He is not known to have\nanything to do with women. He neither drinks nor smokes. He is said to\nbe honest. Considerable sums of money have passed through his hands and\nthere has never been any question as to his not having made a proper (!)\nuse of them. He has undoubted courage and is a hard worker. He is said\nto pride himself on keeping his word.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden returned the document to R.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A fanatic.\" Ashenden thought there was about the man something rather\nromantic and attractive, but he knew that R. did not want any nonsense\nof that sort from him. \"He looks like a very dangerous fellow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He is the most dangerous conspirator in or out of India. He's done more\nharm than all the rest of them put together. You know that there's a\ngang of these Indians in Berlin; well, he's the brains of it. If he\ncould be got out of the way I could afford to ignore the others; he's\nthe only one who has any guts. I've been trying to catch him for a year,\nI thought there wasn't a hope; but now at last I've got a chance and, by\nGod, I'm going to take it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what'll you do then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. chuckled grimly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shoot him and shoot him damn quick.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden did not answer. R. walked once or twice across the small room\nand then, again with his back to the fire, faced Ashenden. His thin\nmouth was twisted by a sarcastic smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you notice at the end of that report I gave you it said he wasn't\nknown to have anything to do with women? Well, that was true, but it\nisn't any longer. The damned fool has fallen in love.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. stepped over to his despatch-case and took out a bundle tied up with\npale-blue ribbon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look, here are his love-letters. You're a novelist, it might amuse you\nto read them. In fact you should read them, it will help you to deal\nwith the situation. Take them away with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. flung the neat little bundle back into the despatch-case.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One wonders how an able man like that can allow himself to get besotted\nover a woman. It was the last thing I ever expected of him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden's eyes travelled to the bowl of beautiful roses that stood on\nthe table, but he said nothing. R., who missed little, saw the glance\nand his look suddenly darkened. Ashenden knew that he felt like asking\nhim what the devil he was staring at. At that moment R. had no friendly\nfeelings towards his subordinate, but he made no remark. He went back to\nthe subject in hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Anyhow that's neither here nor there. Chandra has fallen madly in love\nwith a woman called Giulia Lazzari. He's crazy about her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you know how he picked her up?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I do. She's a dancer, and she does Spanish dances, but she\nhappens to be an Italian. For stage purposes she calls herself La\nMalagueña. You know the kind of thing. Popular Spanish music and a\nmantilla, a fan and a high comb. She's been dancing all over Europe for\nthe last ten years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is she any good?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, rotten. She's been in the provinces in England and she's had a few\nengagements in London. She never got more than ten pounds a week.\nChandra met her in Berlin in a Tingel-tangel, you know what that is, a\ncheap sort of music-hall. I take it that on the Continent she looked\nupon her dancing chiefly as a means to enhance her value as a\nprostitute.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did she get to Berlin during the war?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's been married to a Spaniard at one time; I think she still is\nthough they don't live together, and she travelled on a Spanish\npassport. It appears Chandra made a dead set for her.\" R. took up the\nIndian's photograph again and looked at it thoughtfully. \"You wouldn't\nhave thought there was anything very attractive in that greasy little\nnigger. God, how they run to fat! The fact remains that she fell very\nnearly as much in love with him as he did with her. I've got her letters\ntoo, only copies, of course, he's got the originals and I dare say he\nkeeps them tied up in pink ribbon. She's mad about him. I'm not a\nliterary man, but I think I know when a thing rings true; anyhow you'll\nbe reading them, and you can tell me what you think. And then people say\nthere's no such thing as love at first sight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. smiled with faint irony. He was certainly in a good humour this\nmorning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But how did you get hold of all these letters?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did I get hold of them? How do you imagine? Owing to her Italian\nnationality Giulia Lazzari was eventually expelled from Germany. She was\nput over the Dutch frontier. Having an engagement to dance in England\nshe was granted a visa and\"--R. looked up a date among the papers--\"and\non the twenty-fourth of October last sailed from Rotterdam to Harwich.\nSince then she has danced in London, Birmingham, Portsmouth and other\nplaces. She was arrested a fortnight ago at Hull.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What for?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Espionage. She was transferred to London and I went to see her myself\nat Holloway.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden and R. looked at one another for a moment without speaking and\nit may be that each was trying his hardest to read the other's thoughts.\nAshenden was wondering where the truth in all this lay and R. wondered\nhow much of it he could advantageously tell him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did you get on to her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought it odd that the Germans should allow her to dance quite\nquietly in Berlin for weeks and then for no particular reason decide to\nput her out of the country. It would be a good introduction for\nespionage. And a dancer who was not too careful of her virtue might make\nopportunities of learning things that it would be worth somebody's while\nin Berlin to pay a good price for. I thought it might be as well to let\nher come to England and see what she was up to. I kept track of her. I\ndiscovered that she was sending letters to an address in Holland two or\nthree times a week and two or three times a week was receiving answers\nfrom Holland. Hers were written in a queer mixture of French, German and\nEnglish; she speaks English a little and French quite well, but the\nanswers were written entirely in English; it was good English, but not\nan Englishman's English, flowery and rather grandiloquent; I wondered\nwho was writing them. They seemed to be just ordinary love-letters, but\nthey were by way of being rather hot stuff. It was plain enough that\nthey were coming from Germany and the writer was neither English, French\nnor German. Why did he write in English? The only foreigners who know\nEnglish better than any continental language are Orientals, and not\nTurks or Egyptians either; they know French. A Jap would write English\nand so would an Indian. I came to the conclusion that Giulia's lover was\none of that gang of Indians that were making trouble for us in Berlin. I\nhad no idea it was Chandra Lal till I found the photograph.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did you get that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She carried it about with her. It was a pretty good bit of work, that.\nShe kept it locked up in her trunk, with a lot of theatrical\nphotographs, of comic singers and clowns and acrobats; it might easily\nhave passed for the picture of some music-hall artiste in his stage\ndress. In fact, later, when she was arrested and asked who the\nphotograph represented she said she didn't know, it was an Indian\nconjuror who had given it her and she had no idea what his name was.\nAnyhow I put a very smart lad on the job and he thought it queer that it\nshould be the only photograph in the lot that came from Calcutta. He\nnoticed that there was a number on the back, and he took it, the number,\nI mean; of course the photograph was replaced in the box.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, just as a matter of interest how did your very smart lad\nget at the photograph at all?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR.'s eyes twinkled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's none of your business. But I don't mind telling you that he was\na good-looking boy. Anyhow it's of no consequence. When we got the\nnumber of the photograph we cabled to Calcutta and in a little while I\nreceived the grateful news that the object of Giulia's affections was no\nless a person than the incorruptible Chandra Lal. Then I thought it my\nduty to have Giulia watched a little more carefully. She seemed to have\na sneaking fondness for naval officers. I couldn't exactly blame her for\nthat; they are attractive, but it is unwise for ladies of easy virtue\nand doubtful nationality to cultivate their society in war-time.\nPresently I got a very pretty little body of evidence against her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How was she getting her stuff through?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She wasn't getting it through. She wasn't trying to. The Germans had\nturned her out quite genuinely; she wasn't working for them, she was\nworking for Chandra. After her engagement was through in England she was\nplanning to go to Holland again and meet him. She wasn't very clever at\nthe work; she was nervous, but it looked easy; no one seemed to bother\nabout her, it grew rather exciting; she was getting all sorts of\ninteresting information without any risk. In one of her letters she\nsaid: 'I have so much to tell you, <i>mon petit chou</i> darling, and what\nyou will be <i>extrêmement intéressé</i> to know,' and she underlined the\nFrench words.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. paused and rubbed his hands together. His tired face bore a look of\ndevilish enjoyment of his own cunning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was espionage made easy. Of course I didn't care a damn about her,\nit was him I was after. Well, as soon as I'd got the goods on her I\narrested her. I had enough evidence to convict a regiment of spies.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. put his hands in his pockets and his pale lips twisted to a smile\nthat was almost a grimace.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Holloway's not a very cheerful place, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I imagine no prison is,\" remarked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I left her to stew in her own juice for a week before I went to see\nher. She was in a very pretty state of nerves by then. The wardress told\nme she'd been in violent hysterics most of the time. I must say she\nlooked like the devil.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is she handsome?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll see for yourself. She's not my type. I dare say she's better\nwhen she's made up and that kind of thing. I talked to her like a Dutch\nuncle. I put the fear of God into her. I told her she'd get ten years. I\nthink I scared her, I know I tried to. Of course she denied everything,\nbut the proofs were there, I assured her she hadn't got a chance. I\nspent three hours with her. She went all to pieces and at last she\nconfessed everything. Then I told her that I'd let her go scot-free if\nshe'd get Chandra to come to France. She absolutely refused, she said\nshe'd rather die; she was very hysterical and tiresome, but I let her\nrave. I told her to think it over and said I'd see her in a day or two\nand we'd have another talk about it. In point of fact I left her for a\nweek. She'd evidently had time to reflect, because when I came again she\nasked me quite calmly what it was exactly that I proposed. She'd been in\na gaol a fortnight then and I expect she'd had about enough of it. I put\nit to her as plainly as I could and she accepted.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think I quite understand,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you? I should have thought it was clear to the meanest\nintelligence. If she can get Chandra to cross the Swiss frontier and\ncome into France she's to go free, either to Spain or to South America,\nwith her passage paid.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And how the devil is she to get Chandra to do that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's madly in love with her. He's longing to see her. His letters are\nalmost crazy. She's written to him to say that she can't get a visa to\nHolland (I told you she was to join him there when her tour was over),\nbut she can get one for Switzerland. That's a neutral country and he's\nsafe there. He jumped at the chance. They've arranged to meet at\nLausanne.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When he reaches Lausanne he'll get a letter from her to say that the\nFrench authorities won't let her cross the frontier and that she's going\nto Thonon, which is just on the other side of the lake from Lausanne, in\nFrance, and she's going to ask him to come there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What makes you think he will?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. paused for an instant. He looked at Ashenden with a pleasant\nexpression.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She must make him if she doesn't want to go to penal servitude for ten\nyears.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's arriving from England this evening in custody and I should like\nyou to take her down to Thonon by the night train.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Me?\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I thought it the sort of job you could manage very well.\nPresumably you know more about human nature than most people. It'll be a\npleasant change for you to spend a week or two at Thonon. I believe it's\na pretty little place, fashionable too--in peace-time. You might take\nthe baths there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what do you expect me to do when I get the lady down to Thonon?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I leave you a free hand. I've made a few notes that may be useful to\nyou. I'll read them to you, shall I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden listened attentively. R.'s plan was simple and explicit.\nAshenden could not but feel unwilling admiration for the brain that had\nso neatly devised it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPresently R. suggested that they should have luncheon and he asked\nAshenden to take him to some place where they could see smart people. It\namused Ashenden to see R., so sharp, sure of himself and alert in his\noffice, seized as he walked into the restaurant with shyness. He talked\na little too loud in order to show that he was at his ease and made\nhimself somewhat unnecessarily at home. You saw in his manner the shabby\nand commonplace life he had led till the hazards of war raised him to a\nposition of consequence. He was glad to be in that fashionable\nrestaurant cheek by jowl with persons who bore great or distinguished\nnames, but he felt like a schoolboy in his first top-hat, and he quailed\nbefore the steely eye of the <i>maître d'hôtel</i>. His quick glance darted\nhere and there and his sallow face beamed with a self-satisfaction of\nwhich he was slightly ashamed. Ashenden drew his attention to an ugly\nwoman in black, with a lovely figure, wearing a long row of pearls.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is Madame de Brides. She is the mistress of the Grand Duke\nTheodore. She's probably one of the most influential women in Europe,\nshe's certainly one of the cleverest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR.'s clever eyes rested on her and he flushed a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By George, this is life,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden watched him curiously. Luxury is dangerous to people who have\nnever known it and to whom its temptations are held out too suddenly.\nR., that shrewd, cynical man, was captivated by the vulgar glamour and\nthe shoddy brilliance of the scene before him. Just as the advantage of\nculture is that it enables you to talk nonsense with distinction, so the\nhabit of luxury allows you to regard its frills and furbelows with a\nproper contumely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut when they had eaten their luncheon and were drinking their coffee\nAshenden, seeing that R. was mellowed by the good meal and his\nsurroundings, went back to the subject that was in his thoughts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That Indian fellow must be a rather remarkable chap,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's got brains, of course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One can't help being impressed by a man who had the courage to take on\nalmost single-handed the whole British power in India.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't get sentimental about him if I were you. He's nothing but a\ndangerous criminal.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't suppose he'd use bombs if he could command a few batteries and\nhalf a dozen battalions. He uses what weapons he can. You can hardly\nblame him for that. After all, he's aiming at nothing for himself, is\nhe? He's aiming at freedom for his country. On the face of it it looks\nas though he were justified in his actions.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut R. had no notion of what Ashenden was talking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's very far-fetched and morbid,\" he said. \"We can't go into all\nthat. Our job is to get him and when we've got him to shoot him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course. He's declared war and he must take his chance. I shall carry\nout your instructions, that's what I'm here for, but I see no harm in\nrealising that there's something to be admired and respected in him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nR. was once more the cool and astute judge of his fellows.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've not yet made up my mind whether the best men for this kind of job\nare those who do it with passion or those who keep their heads. Some of\nthem are filled with hatred for the people we're up against and when we\ndown them it gives them a sort of satisfaction like satisfying a\npersonal grudge. Of course they're very keen on their work. You're\ndifferent, aren't you? You look at it like a game of chess and you don't\nseem to have any feeling one way or the other. I can't quite make it\nout. Of course for some sort of jobs it's just what one wants.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden did not answer. He called for the bill and walked back with R.\nto the hotel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe train started at eight. When he had disposed of his bag Ashenden\nwalked along the platform. He found the carriage in which Giulia Lazzari\nwas, but she sat in a corner, looking away from the light, so that he\ncould not see her face. She was in charge of two detectives who had\ntaken her over from English police at Boulogne. One of them worked with\nAshenden on the French side of the Lake Geneva and as Ashenden came up\nhe nodded to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've asked the lady if she will dine in the restaurant-car, but she\nprefers to have dinner in the carriage, so I've ordered a basket. Is\nthat quite correct?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My companion and I will go into the diner in turn so that she will not\nremain alone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is very considerate of you. I will come along when we've started\nand have a chat with her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's not disposed to be very talkative,\" said the detective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One could hardly expect it,\" replied Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe walked on to get his ticket for the second service and then returned\nto his own carriage. Giulia Lazzari was just finishing her meal when he\nwent back to her. From a glance at the basket he judged that she had not\neaten with too poor an appetite. The detective who was guarding her\nopened the door when Ashenden appeared and at Ashenden's suggestion left\nthem alone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGiulia Lazzari gave him a sullen look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope you've had what you wanted for dinner,\" he said as he sat down\nin front of her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe bowed slightly, but did not speak. He took out his case.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you have a cigarette?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a glance, seemed to hesitate, and then, still without a\nword, took one. He struck a match and, lighting it, looked at her. He\nwas surprised. For some reason he had expected her to be fair, perhaps\nfrom some notion that an Oriental would be more likely to fall for a\nblonde; but she was almost swarthy. Her hair was hidden by a\nclose-fitting hat, but her eyes were coal-black. She was far from young,\nshe might have been thirty-five, and her skin was lined and sallow. She\nhad at the moment no make-up on and she looked haggard. There was\nnothing beautiful about her but her magnificent eyes. She was big, and\nAshenden thought she must be too big to dance gracefully; it might be\nthat in Spanish costume she was a bold and flaunting figure, but there\nin the train, shabbily dressed, there was nothing to explain the\nIndian's infatuation. She gave Ashenden a long, appraising stare. She\nwondered evidently what sort of man he was. She blew a cloud of smoke\nthrough her nostrils and gave it a glance, then looked back at Ashenden.\nHe could see that her sullenness was only a mask, she was nervous and\nfrightened. She spoke in French with an Italian accent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who are you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My name would mean nothing to you, <i>madame</i>. I am going to Thonon. I\nhave taken a room for you at the Hotel de la Place. It is the only one\nopen now. I think you will find it quite comfortable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, it is you the Colonel spoke to me of. You are my gaoler.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Only as a matter of form. I shall not intrude upon you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All the same you are my gaoler.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope not for very long. I have in my pocket your passport with all\nthe formalities completed to permit you to go to Spain.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe threw herself back into the corner of the carriage. White with those\ngreat black eyes, in the poor light, her face was suddenly a mask of\ndespair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's infamous. Oh, I think I could die happy if I could only kill that\nold Colonel. He has no heart. I'm so unhappy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am afraid you have got yourself into a very unfortunate situation.\nDid you not know that espionage was a dangerous game?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never sold any of the secrets. I did no harm.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Surely only because you had no opportunity. I understand that you\nsigned a full confession.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden spoke to her as amiably as he could, a little as though he were\ntalking to a sick person, and there was no harshness in his voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, yes, I made a fool of myself. I wrote the letter the Colonel said I\nwas to write. Why isn't that enough? What is to happen to me if he does\nnot answer? I cannot force him to come if he does not want to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He has answered,\" said Ashenden. \"I have the answer with me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave a gasp and her voice broke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, show it to me, I beseech you to let me see it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have no objection to doing that. But you must return it to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took Chandra's letter from his pocket and gave it to her. She\nsnatched it from his hand. She devoured it with her eyes, there were\neight pages of it, and as she read the tears streamed down her cheeks.\nBetween her sobs she gave little exclamations of love, calling the\nwriter by pet-names French and Italian. This was the letter that Chandra\nhad written in reply to hers telling him, on R.'s instructions, that she\nwould meet him in Switzerland. He was mad with joy at the prospect. He\ntold her in passionate phrases how long the time had seemed to him since\nthey were parted, and how he had yearned for her, and now that he was to\nsee her again so soon he did not know how he was going to bear his\nimpatience. She finished it and let it drop to the floor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can see he loves me, can't you? There's no doubt about that. I know\nsomething about it, believe me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you really love him?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's the only man who's ever been kind to me. It's not very gay, the\nlife one leads in these music-halls, all over Europe, never resting, and\nmen--they are not much, the men who haunt those places. At first I\nthought he was just like the rest of them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden picked up the letter and replaced it in his pocket-book.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A telegram was sent in your name to the address in Holland to say that\nyou would be at the Hotel Gibbons at Lausanne on the 14th.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is to-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe threw up her head and her eyes flashed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, it is an infamous thing that you are forcing me to do. It is\nshameful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are not obliged to do it,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And if I don't?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid you must take the consequences.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't go to prison,\" she cried out suddenly, \"I can't, I can't; I\nhave such a short time before me; he said ten years. Is it possible I\ncould be sentenced to ten years?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If the Colonel told you so it is very possible.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I know him. That cruel face. He would have no mercy. And what\nshould I be in ten years? Oh, no no.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment the train stopped at a station and the detective waiting\nin the corridor tapped on the window. Ashenden opened the door and the\nman gave him a picture-postcard. It was a dull little view of\nPontarlier, the frontier station between France and Switzerland, and\nshowed a dusty <i>place</i> with a statue in the middle and a few\nplane-trees. Ashenden handed her a pencil.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you write this postcard to your lover. It will be posted at\nPontarlier. Address it to the hotel at Lausanne.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a glance, but without answering took it and wrote as he\ndirected.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now on the other side write: 'Delayed at frontier but everything all\nright. Wait at Lausanne.' Then add whatever you like, tendresses, if you\nlie.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took the postcard from her, read it to see that she had done as he\ndirected and then reached for his hat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I shall leave you now, I hope you will have a sleep. I will fetch\nyou in the morning when we arrive at Thonon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe second detective had now returned from his dinner and as Ashenden\ncame out of the carriage the two men went in. Giulia Lazzari huddled\nback into her corner. Ashenden gave the postcard to an agent who was\nwaiting to take it to Pontarlier and then made his way along the crowded\ntrain to his sleeping-car.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was bright and sunny, though cold, next morning when they reached\ntheir destination. Ashenden, having given his bags to a porter, walked\nalong the platform to where Giulia Lazzari and the two detectives were\nstanding. Ashenden nodded to them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, good-morning. You need not trouble to wait.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey touched their hats, gave a word of farewell to the woman, and\nwalked away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where are they going?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Off. You will not be bothered with them any more.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Am I in your custody then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're in nobody's custody. I'm going to permit myself to take you to\nyour hotel and then I shall leave you. You must try to get a good rest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden's porter took her hand-luggage and she gave him the ticket for\nher trunk. They walked out of the station. A cab was waiting for them\nand Ashenden begged her to get in. It was a longish drive to the hotel\nand now and then Ashenden felt that she gave him a sidelong glance. She\nwas perplexed. He sat without a word. When they reached the hotel the\nproprietor--it was a small hotel, prettily situated at the corner of a\nlittle promenade and it had a charming view--showed them the room that\nhad been prepared for Madame Lazzari. Ashenden turned to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That'll do very nicely, I think. I shall come down in a minute.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe proprietor bowed and withdrew.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall do my best to see that you are comfortable, madame,\" said\nAshenden. \"You are here absolutely your own mistress and you may order\npretty well anything you like. To the proprietor you are just a guest of\nthe hotel like any other. You are absolutely free.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Free to go out?\" she asked quickly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"With a policeman on either side of me, I suppose.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not at all. You are as free in the hotel as though you were in your own\nhouse and you are free to go out and come in when you choose. I should\nlike an assurance from you that you will not write letters without my\nknowledge or attempt to leave Thonon without my permission.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave Ashenden a long stare. She could not make it out at all. She\nlooked as though she thought it a dream.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am in a position that forces me to give you any assurance you ask. I\ngive you my word of honour that I will not write a letter without\nshowing it to you or attempt to leave this place.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you. Now I will leave you. I will do myself the pleasure of\ncoming to see you to-morrow morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden nodded and went out. He stopped for five minutes at the\npolice-station to see that everything was in order and then took the cab\nup the hill to a little secluded house on the outskirts of the town at\nwhich on his periodical visits to this place he stayed. It was pleasant\nto have a bath and a shave and get into slippers. He felt lazy and spent\nthe rest of the morning reading a novel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSoon after dark, for even at Thonon, though it was in France, it was\nthought desirable to attract attention to Ashenden as little as\npossible, an agent from the police-station came to see him. His name was\nFelix. He was a little dark Frenchman with sharp eyes and an unshaven\nchin, dressed in a shabby grey suit and rather down at heel, so that he\nlooked like a lawyer's clerk out of work. Ashenden offered him a glass\nof wine and they sat down by the fire.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, your lady lost no time,\" he said. \"Within a quarter of an hour of\nher arrival she was out of the hotel with a bundle of clothes and\ntrinkets that she sold in a shop near the market. When the afternoon\nboat came in she went down to the quay and bought a ticket to Evian.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEvian, it should be explained, was the next place along the lake in\nFrance and from there, crossing over, the boat went to Switzerland.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course she hadn't a passport, so permission to embark was denied\nher.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did she explain that she had no passport?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She said she'd forgotten it. She said she had an appointment to see\nfriends in Evian and tried to persuade the official in charge to let her\ngo. She attempted to slip a hundred francs into his hand.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She must be a stupider woman than I thought,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut when next day he went about eleven in the morning to see her he made\nno reference to her attempt to escape. She had had time to arrange\nherself, and now, her hair elaborately done, her lips and cheeks\npainted, she looked less haggard than when he had first seen her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've brought you some books,\" said Ashenden. \"I'm afraid the time hangs\nheavy on your hands.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does that matter to you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have no wish that you should suffer anything that can be avoided.\nAnyhow, I will leave them and you can read them or not as you choose.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you only knew how I hated you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would doubtless make me very uncomfortable. But I really don't know\nwhy you should. I am only doing what I have been ordered to do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you want of me now? I do not suppose you have come only to ask\nafter my health.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want you to write a letter to your lover telling him that owing to\nsome irregularity in your passport the Swiss authorities would not let\nyou cross the frontier, so you have come here where it is very nice and\nquiet, so quiet that one can hardly realise there is a war, and you\npropose that Chandra should join you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think he is a fool? He will refuse.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then you must do your best to persuade him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at Ashenden a long time before she answered. He suspected\nthat she was debating within herself whether by writing the letter and\nso seeming docile she could not gain time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, dictate and I will write what you say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should prefer you to put it in your own words.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give me half an hour and the letter shall be ready.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will wait here,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Because I prefer to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer eyes flashed angrily, but controlling herself she said nothing. On\nthe chest of drawers were writing materials. She sat down at the\ndressing-table and began to write. When she handed Ashenden the letter\nhe saw that even through her rouge she was very pale. It was the letter\nof a person not much used to expressing herself by means of pen and ink,\nbut it was well enough, and when towards the end, starting to say how\nmuch she loved the man, she had been carried away and wrote with all her\nheart, it had really a certain passion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now add: The man who is bringing this is Swiss, you can trust him\nabsolutely. I didn't want the censor to see it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe hesitated an instant, but then wrote as he directed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How do you spell, absolutely?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As you like. Now address an envelope and I will relieve you of my\nunwelcome presence.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave the letter to the agent who was waiting to take it across the\nlake. Ashenden brought her the reply the same evening. She snatched it\nfrom his hands and for a moment pressed it to her heart. When she read\nit she uttered a little cry of relief.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He won't come.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe letter, in the Indian's flowery, stilted English, expressed his\nbitter disappointment. He told her how intensely he had looked forward\nto seeing her and implored her to do everything in the world to smooth\nthe difficulties that prevented her from crossing the frontier. He said\nthat it was impossible for him to come, impossible, there was a price on\nhis head, and it would be madness for him to think of risking it. He\nattempted to be jocular, she did not want her little fat lover to be\nshot, did she?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He won't come,\" she repeated, \"he won't come.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must write and tell him that there is no risk. You must say that if\nthere were you would not dream of asking him. You must say that if he\nloves you he will not hesitate.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I won't. I won't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be a fool. You can't help yourself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe burst into a sudden flood of tears. She flung herself on the floor\nand seizing Ashenden's knees implored him to have mercy on her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will do anything in the world for you if you will let me go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be absurd,\" said Ashenden. \"Do you think I want to become your\nlover? Come, come, you must be serious. You know the alternative.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe raised herself to her feet and changing on a sudden to fury flung at\nAshenden one foul name after another.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I like you much better like that,\" he said. \"Now will you write or\nshall I send for the police?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He will not come. It is useless.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is very much to your interest to make him come.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean by that? Do you mean that if I do everything in my\npower and fail, that...\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at Ashenden with wild eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, it means either you or him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe staggered. She put her hand to her heart. Then without a word she\nreached for pen and paper. But the letter was not to Ashenden's liking\nand he made her write it again. When she had finished she flung herself\non the bed and burst once more into passionate weeping. Her grief was\nreal, but there was something theatrical in the expression of it that\nprevented it from being peculiarly moving to Ashenden. He felt his\nrelation to her as impersonal as a doctor's in the presence of a pain\nthat he cannot alleviate. He saw now why R. had given him this peculiar\ntask; it needed a cool head and an emotion well under control.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not see her next day. The answer to the letter was not delivered\nto him till after dinner, when it was brought to Ashenden's little house\nby Felix.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what news have you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Our friend is getting desperate,\" smiled the Frenchman. \"This afternoon\nshe walked up to the station just as a train was about to start for\nLyons. She was looking up and down uncertainly so I went to her and\nasked if there was anything I could do. I introduced myself as an agent\nof the Sureté. If looks could kill I should not be standing here now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sit down, <i>mon ami</i>,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Merci. She walked away, she evidently thought it was no use to try to\nget on the train, but I have something more interesting to tell you. She\nhas offered a boatman on the lake a thousand francs to take her across\nto Lausanne.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did he say to her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He said he couldn't risk it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe little agent gave his shoulders a slight shrug and smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's asked him to meet her on the road that leads to Evian at ten\no'clock to-night so that they can talk of it again, and she's given him\nto understand that she will not repulse too fiercely the advances of a\nlover. I have told him to do what he likes so long as he comes and tells\nme everything that is of importance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you sure you can trust him?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, quite. He knows nothing, of course, but that she is under\nsurveillance. You need have no fear about him. He is a good boy. I have\nknown him all his life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden read Chandra's letter. It was eager and passionate. It throbbed\nstrangely with the painful yearning of his heart. Love? Yes, if Ashenden\nknew anything of it there was the real thing. He told her how he spent\nthe long hours walking by the lakeside and looking towards the coast of\nFrance. How near they were and yet so desperately parted! He repeated\nagain and again that he could not come, and begged her not to ask him,\nhe would do everything in the world for her, but that he dared not do,\nand yet if she insisted how could he resist her? He besought her to have\nmercy on him. And then he broke into a long wail at the thought that he\nmust go away without seeing her, he asked her if there were not some\nmeans by which she could slip over, he swore that if he could ever hold\nher in his arms again he would never let her go. Even the forced and\nelaborate language in which it was written could not dim the hot fire\nthat burned the pages; it was the letter of a madman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When will you hear the result of her interview with the boatman?\" asked\nAshenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have arranged to meet him at the landing-stage between eleven and\ntwelve.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden looked at his watch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will come with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey walked down the hill and reaching the quay for shelter from the\ncold wind stood in the lea of the custom-house. At last they saw a man\napproaching and Felix stepped out of the shadow that hid them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Antoine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Monsieur Felix</i>? I have a letter for you; I promised to take it to\nLausanne by the first boat to-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden gave the man a brief glance, but did not ask what had passed\nbetween him and Giulia Lazzari. He took the letter and by the light of\nFelix's electric torch read it. It was in faulty German.\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    \"<i>On no account come.  Pay no attention to my letters.  Danger.\n     I love you.  Sweetheart.  Don't come.</i>\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nHe put it in his pocket, gave the boatman fifty francs, and went home to\nbed. But the next day when he went to see Giulia Lazzari he found her\ndoor locked. He knocked for some time, there was no answer. He called\nher.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Madame Lazzari, you must open the door. I want to speak to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am in bed. I am ill and can see no one.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am sorry, but you must open the door. If you are ill I will send for\na doctor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, go away. I will see no one.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you do not open the door I shall send for a locksmith and have it\nbroken open.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a silence and then he heard the key turned in the lock. He\nwent in. She was in a dressing-gown and her hair was dishevelled. She\nhad evidently just got out of bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am at the end of my strength. I can do nothing more. You have only to\nlook at me to see that I am ill. I have been sick all night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall not keep you long. Would you like to see a doctor?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What good can a doctor do me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took out of his pocket the letter she had given the boatman and\nhanded it to her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave a gasp at the sight of it and her sallow face went green.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You gave me your word that you would neither attempt to escape nor\nwrite a letter without my knowledge.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you think I would keep my word?\" she cried, her voice ringing with\nscorn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. To tell you the truth it was not entirely for your convenience that\nyou were placed in a comfortable hotel rather than in the local gaol,\nbut I think I should tell you that though you have your freedom to go in\nand out as you like you have no more chance of getting away from Thonon\nthan if you were chained by the leg in a prison cell. It is silly to\nwaste your time writing letters that will never be delivered.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Cochon.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe flung the opprobrious word at him with all the violence that was in\nher.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But you must sit down and write a letter that <i>will</i> be delivered.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never. I will do nothing more. I will not write another word.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You came here on the understanding that you would do certain things.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will not do them. It is finished.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You had better reflect a little.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Reflect! I have reflected. You can do what you like; I don't care.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well, I will give you five minutes to change your mind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden took out his watch and looked at it. He sat down on the edge of\nthe unmade bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, it has got on my nerves, this hotel. Why did you not put me in the\nprison? Why, why? Everywhere I went I felt that spies were on my heels.\nIt is infamous what you are making me do. Infamous! What is my crime? I\nask you, what have I done? Am I not a woman? It is infamous what you are\nasking me to do. Infamous.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe spoke in a high shrill voice. She went on and on. At last the five\nminutes were up. Ashenden had not said a word. He rose.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, go, go,\" she shrieked at him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe flung foul names at him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall come back,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took the key out of the door as he went out of the room and locked it\nbehind him. Going downstairs he hurriedly scribbled a note, called the\nboots and dispatched him with it to the police-station. Then he went up\nagain. Giulia Lazzari had thrown herself on her bed and turned her face\nto the wall. Her body was shaken with hysterical sobs. She gave no sign\nthat she heard him come in. Ashenden sat down on the chair in front of\nthe dressing-table and looked idly at the odds and ends that littered\nit. The toilet things were cheap and tawdry and none too clean. There\nwere little shabby pots of rouge and cold-cream and little bottles of\nblack for the eyebrows and eyelashes. The hairpins were horrid and\ngreasy. The room was untidy and the air was heavy with the smell of\ncheap scent. Ashenden thought of the hundreds of rooms she must have\noccupied in third-rate hotels in the course of her wandering life from\nprovincial town to provincial town in one country after another. He\nwondered what had been her origins. She was a coarse and vulgar woman,\nbut what had she been when young? She was not the type he would have\nexpected to adopt that career, for she seemed to have no advantages that\ncould help her, and he asked himself whether she came of a family of\nentertainers (there are all over the world families in which for\ngenerations the members have become dancers or acrobats or comic\nsingers) or whether she had fallen into the life accidentally through\nsome lover in the business who had for a time made her his partner. And\nwhat men must she have known in all these years, the comrades of the\nshows she was in, the agents and managers who looked upon it as a\nperquisite of their position that they should enjoy her favours, the\nmerchants or well-to-do tradesmen, the young sparks of the various towns\nshe played in, who were attracted for the moment by the glamour of the\ndancer or the blatant sensuality of the woman! To her they were the\npaying customers and she accepted them indifferently as the recognised\nand admitted supplement to her miserable salary, but to them perhaps she\nwas romance. In her bought arms they caught sight for a moment of the\nbrilliant world of the capitals, and ever so distantly and however\nshoddily of the adventure and the glamour of a more spacious life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a sudden knock at the door and Ashenden immediately cried out:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Entrez.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGiulia Lazzari sprang up in bed to a sitting posture.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is it?\" she called.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave a gasp as she saw the two detectives who had brought her from\nBoulogne and handed her over to Ashenden at Thonon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You! What do you want?\" she shrieked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Allons, levez vous</i>,\" said one of them, and his voice had a sharp\nabruptness that suggested that he would put up with no nonsense.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid you must get up, Madame Lazzari,\" said Ashenden. \"I am\ndelivering you once more to the care of these gentlemen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How can I get up! I'm ill, I tell you. I cannot stand. Do you want to\nkill me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you won't dress yourself, we shall have to dress you, and I'm afraid\nwe shouldn't do it very cleverly. Come, come, it's no good making a\nscene.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where are you going to take me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're going to take you back to England.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne of the detectives took hold of her arm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't touch me, don't come near me,\" she screamed furiously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let her be,\" said Ashenden. \"I'm sure she'll see the necessity of\nmaking as little trouble as possible.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll dress myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden watched her as she took off her dressing-gown and slipped a\ndress over her head. She forced her feet into shoes obviously too small\nfor her. She arranged her hair. Every now and then she gave the\ndetectives a hurried, sullen glance. Ashenden wondered if she would have\nthe nerve to go through with it. R. would call him a damned fool, but he\nalmost wished she would. She went up to the dressing-table and Ashenden\nstood up in order to let her sit down. She greased her face quickly and\nthen rubbed off the grease with a dirty towel, she powdered herself and\nmade up her eyes. But her hand shook. The three men watched her in\nsilence. She rubbed the rouge on her cheeks and painted her mouth. Then\nshe crammed a hat down on her head. Ashenden made a gesture to the first\ndetective and he took a pair of handcuffs out of his pocket and advanced\ntowards her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt the sight of them she started back violently and flung her arms wide.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Non, non, non, Je ne veux pas.</i> No, not them. No. No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come, <i>ma fille</i>, don't be silly,\" said the detective roughly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs though for protection (very much to his surprise) she flung her arms\nround Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't let them take me, have mercy on me, I can't, I can't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden extricated himself as best he could.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can do nothing more for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe detective seized her wrists and was about to affix the handcuffs\nwhen with a great cry she threw herself down on the floor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will do what you wish. I will do everything.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn a sign from Ashenden the detectives left the room. He waited for a\nlittle till she had regained a certain calm. She was lying on the floor,\nsobbing passionately. He raised her to her feet and made her sit down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you want me to do?\" she gasped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want you to write another letter to Chandra.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My head is in a whirl. I could not put two phrases together. You must\ngive me time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Ashenden felt that it was better to get her to write a letter while\nshe was under the effect of her terror. He did not want to give her time\nto collect herself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will dictate the letter to you. All you have to do is to write\nexactly what I tell you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave a deep sigh, but took the pen and the paper and sat down before\nthem at the dressing-table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If I do this and... and you succeed, how do I know that I shall be\nallowed to go free?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Colonel promised that you should. You must take my word for it that\nI shall carry out his instructions.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I <i>should</i> look a fool if I betrayed my friend and then went to prison\nfor ten years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll tell you your best guarantee of our good faith. Except by reason\nof Chandra you are not of the smallest importance to us. Why should we\nput ourselves to the bother and expense of keeping you in prison when\nyou can do us no harm?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe reflected for an instant. She was composed now. It was as though,\nhaving exhausted her emotion, she had become on a sudden a sensible and\npractical woman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell me what you want me to write.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden hesitated. He thought he could put the letter more or less in\nthe way she would naturally have put it, but he had to give it\nconsideration. It must be neither fluent nor literary. He knew that in\nmoments of emotion people are inclined to be melodramatic and stilted.\nIn a book or on the stage this always rings false and the author has to\nmake his people speak more simply and with less emphasis than in fact\nthey do. It was a serious moment, but Ashenden felt that there were in\nit elements of the comic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know I loved a coward,\" he started. \"If you loved me you\ncouldn't hesitate when I ask you to come.... Underline <i>couldn't</i>\ntwice.\" He went on. \"When I promise you there is no danger. If you don't\nlove me, you are right not to come. Don't come. Go back to Berlin where\nyou are in safety. I am sick of it. I am alone here. I have made myself\nill by waiting for you and every day I have said he is coming. If you\nloved me you would not hesitate so much. It is quite clear to me that\nyou do not love me. I am sick and tired of you. I have no money. This\nhotel is impossible. There is nothing for me to stay for. I can get an\nengagement in Paris. I have a friend there who has made me serious\npropositions. I have wasted long enough over you and look what I have\ngot from it. It is finished. Good-bye. You will never find a woman who\nwill love you as I have loved you. I cannot afford to refuse the\nproposition of my friend, so I have telegraphed to him and as soon as I\nshall receive his answer I go to Paris. I do not blame you because you\ndo not love me, that is not your fault, but you must see that I should\nbe a stupid to go on wasting my life. One is not young for ever.\nGood-bye. Giulia.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ashenden read over the letter he was not altogether satisfied. But\nit was the best he could do. It had an air of verisimilitude which the\nwords lacked because, knowing little English, she had written\nphonetically, the spelling was atrocious and the handwriting like a\nchild's; she had crossed out words and written them over again. Some of\nthe phrases he had put in French. Once or twice tears had fallen on the\npages and blurred the ink.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I leave you now,\" said Ashenden. \"It may be that when next you see me I\nshall be able to tell you that you are free to go where you choose.\nWhere do you want to go?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Spain.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well, I will have everything prepared.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shrugged her shoulders. He left her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was nothing now for Ashenden to do but wait. He sent a messenger\nto Lausanne in the afternoon, and next morning went down to the quay to\nmeet the boat. There was a waiting-room next to the ticket-office and\nhere he told the detectives to hold themselves in readiness. When a boat\narrived the passengers advanced along the pier in line and their\npassports were examined before they were allowed to go ashore. If\nChandra came and showed his passport, and it was very likely that he was\ntravelling with a false one, issued probably by a neutral nation, he was\nto be asked to wait and Ashenden was to identify him. Then he would be\narrested. It was with some excitement that Ashenden watched the boat\ncome in and the little group of people gathered at the gangway. He\nscanned them closely but saw no one who looked in the least like an\nIndian. Chandra had not come. Ashenden did not know what to do. He had\nplayed his last card. There were not more than half a dozen passengers\nfor Thonon, and when they had been examined and gone their way he\nstrolled along the pier.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it's no go,\" he said to Felix, who had been examining the\npassports. \"The gentleman I expected hasn't turned up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have a letter for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe handed Ashenden an envelope addressed to Madame Lazzari on which he\nimmediately recognized the spidery handwriting of Chandra Lal. At that\nmoment the steamer from Geneva which was going to Lausanne and the end\nof the lake hove in sight. It arrived at Thonon every morning twenty\nminutes after the steamer going in the opposite direction had left.\nAshenden had an inspiration.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where is the man who brought it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's in the ticket-office.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give him the letter and tell him to return to the person who gave it to\nhim. He is to say that he took it to the lady and she sent it back. If\nthe person asks him to take another letter he is to say that it is not\nmuch good as she is packing her trunk and leaving Thonon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe saw the letter handed over and the instructions given and then walked\nback to his little house in the country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe next boat on which Chandra could possibly come arrived about five\nand having at that hour an important engagement with an agent working in\nGermany he warned Felix that he might be a few minutes late. But if\nChandra came he could easily be detained; there was no great hurry since\nthe train in which he was to be taken to Paris did not start till\nshortly after eight. When Ashenden had finished his business he strolled\nleisurely down to the lake. It was light still and from the top of the\nhill he saw the steamer pulling out. It was an anxious moment and\ninstinctively he quickened his steps. Suddenly he saw someone running\ntowards him and recognised the man who had taken the letter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quick, quick,\" he cried. \"He's there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden's heart gave a great thud against his chest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At last.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe began to run too and as they ran the man, panting, told him how he\nhad taken back the unopened letter. When he put it in the Indian's hand\nhe turned frightfully pale (\"I should never have thought an Indian could\nturn that colour,\" he said), and turned it over and over in his hand as\nthough he could not understand what his own letter was doing there.\nTears sprang to his eyes and rolled down his cheeks. (\"It was grotesque,\nhe's fat, you know.\") He said something in a language the man did not\nunderstand and then in French asked him when the boat went to Thonon.\nWhen he got on board he looked about, but did not see him, then he\ncaught sight of him, huddled up in an ulster with his hat drawn down\nover his eyes, standing alone in the bows. During the crossing he kept\nhis eyes fixed on Thonon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where is he now?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I got off first and Monsieur Felix told me to come for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose they're holding him in the waiting-room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was out of breath when they reached the pier. He burst into the\nwaiting-room. A group of men, talking at the top of their voices and\ngesticulating wildly, were clustered round a man lying on the ground.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's happened?\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look,\" said Monsieur Felix.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nChandra Lal lay there, his eyes wide open and a thin line of foam on his\nlips, dead. His body was horribly contorted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's killed himself. We've sent for the doctor. He was too quick for\nus.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA sudden thrill of horror passed through Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen the Indian landed Felix recognised from the description that he was\nthe man they wanted. There were only four passengers. He was the last.\nFelix took an exaggerated time to examine the passports of the first\nthree, and then took the Indian's. It was a Spanish one and it was all\nin order. Felix asked the regulation questions and noted them on the\nofficial sheet. Then he looked at him pleasantly and said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Just come into the waiting-room for a moment. There are one or two\nformalities to fulfil.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is my passport not in order?\" the Indian asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perfectly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nChandra hesitated, but then followed the official to the door of the\nwaiting-room. Felix opened it and stood aside.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Entrez.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nChandra went in and the two detectives stood up. He must have suspected\nat once that they were police-officers and realised that he had fallen\ninto a trap.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sit down,\" said Felix. \"I have one or two questions to put to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is hot in here,\" he said, and in point of fact they had a little\nstove there that kept the place like an oven. \"I will take off my coat\nif you permit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Certainly,\" said Felix graciously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took off his coat, apparently with some effort, and he turned to put\nit on a chair, and then before they realised what had happened they were\nstartled to see him stagger and fall heavily to the ground. While taking\noff his coat Chandra had managed to swallow the contents of a bottle\nthat was still clasped in his hand. Ashenden put his nose to it. There\nwas a very distinct odour of almonds.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a little while they looked at the man who lay on the floor. Felix\nwas apologetic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will they be very angry?\" he asked nervously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't see that it was your fault,\" said Ashenden. \"Anyhow, he can do\nno more harm. For my part I am just as glad he killed himself. The\nnotion of his being executed did not make me very comfortable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn a few minutes the doctor arrived and pronounced life extinct.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Prussic acid,\" he said to Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden nodded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will go and see Madame Lazzari,\" he said. \"If she wants to stay a day\nor two longer I shall let her. But if she wants to go to-night of course\nshe can. Will you give the agents at the station instructions to let her\npass?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall be at the station myself,\" said Felix.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden once more climbed the hill. It was night now, a cold, bright\nnight with an unclouded sky and the sight of the new moon, a white\nshining thread, made him turn three times the money in his pocket. When\nhe entered the hotel he was seized on a sudden with distaste for its\ncold banality. It smelt of cabbage and boiled mutton. On the walls of\nthe hall were coloured posters of railway companies advertising\nGrenoble, Carcassonne and the bathing places of Normandy. He went\nupstairs and after a brief knock opened the door of Giulia Lazzari's\nroom. She was sitting in front of her dressing-table, looking at herself\nin the glass, just idly, despairingly, apparently doing nothing, and it\nwas in this that she saw Ashenden as he came in. Her face changed\nsuddenly as she caught sight of his and she sprang up so vehemently that\nthe chair fell over.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it? Why are you so white?\" she cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe turned round and stared at him and her features were gradually\ntwisted to a look of horror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Il est pris,</i>\" she gasped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Il est mort</i>,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dead! He took the poison. He had the time for that. He's escaped you\nafter all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean? How did you know about the poison?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He always carried it with him. He said that the English should never\ntake him alive.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden reflected for an instant. She had kept that secret well. He\nsupposed the possibility of such a thing should have occurred to him.\nHow was he to anticipate these melodramatic devices?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, now you are free. You can go wherever you like and no obstacle\nshall be put in your way. Here are your ticket and your passport and\nhere is the money that was in your possession when you were arrested. Do\nyou wish to see Chandra?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe started.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, no.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is no need. I thought you might care to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe did not weep. Ashenden supposed that she had exhausted all her\nemotion. She seemed apathetic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A telegram will be sent to-night to the Spanish frontier to instruct\nthe authorities to put no difficulties in your way. If you will take my\nadvice you will get out of France as soon as you can.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe said nothing, and since Ashenden had no more to say he made ready to\ngo.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am sorry that I have had to show myself so hard to you. I am glad to\nthink that now the worst of your troubles are over and I hope that time\nwill assuage the grief that I know you must feel for the death of your\nfriend.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden gave her a little bow and turned to the door. But she stopped\nhim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One little moment,\" she said. \"There is one thing I should like to ask.\nI think you have some heart.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Whatever I can do for you, you may be sure I will.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are they going to do with his things?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. Why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen she said something that confounded Ashenden. It was the last thing\nhe expected.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He had a wrist-watch that I gave him last Christmas. It cost twelve\npounds. Can I have it back?\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ashenden, given charge of a number of spies working from\nSwitzerland, was first sent there, R., wishing him to see the sort of\nreports that he would be required to obtain, handed him the\ncommunications, a sheaf of typewritten documents, of a man known in the\nsecret service as Gustav.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's the best fellow we've got,\" said R. \"His information is always\nvery full and circumstantial. I want you to give his reports your very\nbest attention. Of course Gustav is a clever little chap, but there's no\nreason why we shouldn't get just as good reports from the other agents.\nIt's merely a question of explaining exactly what we want.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGustav, who lived at Basle, represented a Swiss firm with branches at\nFrankfort, Mannheim and Cologne, and by virtue of his business was able\nto go in and out of Germany without risk. He travelled up and down the\nRhine, and gathered material about the movement of troops, the\nmanufacture of munitions, the state of mind of the country (a point on\nwhich R. laid stress) and other matters upon which the Allies desired\ninformation. His frequent letters to his wife hid an ingenious code and\nthe moment she received them in Basle she sent them to Ashenden in\nGeneva, who extracted from them the important facts and communicated\nthese in the proper quarter. Every two months Gustav came home and\nprepared one of the reports that served as models to the other spies in\nthis particular section of the secret service.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis employers were pleased with Gustav and Gustav had reason to be\npleased with his employers. His services were so useful that he was not\nonly paid more highly than the others, but for particular scoops had\nreceived from time to time a handsome bonus.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis went on for more than a year. Then something aroused R.'s quick\nsuspicions; he was a man of an amazing alertness, not so much of mind,\nas of instinct, and he had suddenly a feeling that some hanky-panky was\ngoing on. He said nothing definite to Ashenden (whatever R. surmised he\nwas disposed to keep to himself), but told him to go to Basle, Gustav\nbeing then in Germany, and have a talk with Gustav's wife. He left it to\nAshenden to decide the tenor of the conversation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHaving arrived at Basle, and leaving his bag at the station, for he did\nnot yet know whether he would have to stay or not, he took a tram to the\ncorner of the street in which Gustav lived and, with a quick look to see\nthat he was not followed, walked along to the house he sought. It was a\nblock of flats that gave you the impression of decent poverty and\nAshenden conjectured that they were inhabited by clerks and small\ntradespeople. Just inside the door was a cobbler's shop and Ashenden\nstopped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does Herr Grabow live here?\" he asked in his none too fluent German.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I saw him go up a few minutes ago. You'll find him in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was startled, for he had but the day before received through\nGustav's wife a letter addressed from Mannheim in which Gustav by means\nof his code gave the numbers of certain regiments that had just crossed\nthe Rhine. Ashenden thought it unwise to ask the cobbler the question\nthat rose to his lips, so thanked him and went up to the third floor, on\nwhich he knew already that Gustav lived. He rang the bell and heard it\ntinkle within. In a moment the door was opened by a dapper little man\nwith a close-shaven round head and spectacles. He wore carpet slippers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Herr Grabow?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At your service,\" said Gustav.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"May I come in?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGustav was standing with his back to the light and Ashenden could not\nsee the look on his face. He felt a momentary hesitation and gave the\nname under which he received Gustav's letters from Germany.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come in, come in. I am very glad to see you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGustav led the way into a stuffy little room, heavy with carved oak\nfurniture, and on the large table covered with a table-cloth of green\nvelveteen was a typewriter. Gustav was apparently engaged in composing\none of his invaluable reports. A woman was sitting at the open window\ndarning socks, but at a word from Gustav rose, gathered up her things\nand left. Ashenden had disturbed a pretty picture of connubial bliss.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sit down, please. How very fortunate that I was in Basle! I have long\nwanted to make your acquaintance. I have only just this minute returned\nfrom Germany.\" He pointed to the sheets of paper by the typewriter. \"I\nthink you will be pleased with the news I bring. I have some very\nvaluable information.\" He chuckled. \"One is never sorry to earn a\nbonus.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was very cordial, but to Ashenden his cordiality rang false. Gustav\nkept his eyes, smiling behind the glasses, fixed watchfully on Ashenden,\nand it was possible that they held a trace of nervousness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must have travelled quickly to get here only a few hours after your\nletter, sent here and then sent on by your wife, reached me in Geneva.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is very probable. One of the things I had to tell you is that the\nGermans suspect that information is getting through by means of\ncommercial letters and so they have decided to hold up all mail at the\nfrontier for eight-and-forty hours.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see,\" said Ashenden amiably. \"And was it on that account that you\ntook the precaution of dating your letter forty-eight hours after you\nsent it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did I do that? That was very stupid of me. I must have mistaken the day\nof the month.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden looked at Gustav with a smile. That was very thin; Gustav, a\nbusiness man, knew too well how important in his particular job was the\nexactness of a date. The circuitous routes by which it was necessary to\nget information from Germany made it difficult to transmit news quickly\nand it was essential to know precisely on what days certain events had\ntaken place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me look at your passport a minute,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you want with my passport?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want to see when you went into Germany and when you came out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But you do not imagine that my comings and goings are marked on my\npassport? I have methods of crossing the frontier.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden knew a good deal of this matter. He knew that both the Germans\nand the Swiss guarded the frontier with severity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh? Why should you not cross in the ordinary way? You were engaged\nbecause your connection with a Swiss firm supplying necessary goods to\nGermany made it easy for you to travel backwards and forwards without\nsuspicion. I can understand that you might get past the German sentries\nwith the connivance of the Germans, but what about the Swiss?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGustav assumed a look of indignation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do not understand you. Do you mean to suggest that I am in the\nservice of the Germans? I give you my word of honour... I will not\nallow my integrity to be impugned.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You would not be the only one to take money from both sides and provide\ninformation of value to neither.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you pretend that my information is of no value? Why then have you\ngiven me more bonuses than any other agent has received? The Colonel has\nrepeatedly expressed the highest satisfaction with my services.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was Ashenden's turn now to be cordial.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come, come, my dear fellow, do not try to ride the high horse. You do\nnot wish to show me your passport and I will not insist. You are not\nunder the impression that we leave the statements of our agents without\ncorroboration or that we are so foolish as not to keep track of their\nmovements? Even the best of jokes cannot bear an indefinite repetition.\nI am in peace-time a humorist by profession and I tell you that from\nbitter experience.\" Now Ashenden thought the moment had arrived to\nattempt his bluff; he knew something of the excellent but difficult game\nof poker. \"We have information that you have not been to Germany now,\nnor since you were engaged by us, but have sat here quietly in Basle,\nand all your reports are merely due to your fertile imagination.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGustav looked at Ashenden and saw a face expressive of nothing but\ntolerance and good-humour. A smile slowly broke on his lips and he gave\nhis shoulders a little shrug.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you think I was such a fool as to risk my life for fifty pounds a\nmonth? I love my wife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden laughed outright.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I congratulate you. It is not everyone who can flatter himself that he\nhas made a fool of our secret service for a year.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I had the chance of earning money without any difficulty. My firm\nstopped sending me into Germany at the beginning of the war, but I\nlearned what I could from the other travellers. I kept my ears open in\nrestaurants and beer-cellars, and I read the German papers. I got a lot\nof amusement out of sending you reports and letters.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't wonder,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing. What can we do? You are not under the impression that we shall\ncontinue to pay you a salary?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I cannot expect that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, if it is not indiscreet, may I ask if you have been playing\nthe same game with the Germans?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, no,\" Gustav cried vehemently. \"How can you think it? My sympathies\nare absolutely pro-Ally. My heart is entirely with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, why not?\" asked Ashenden. \"The Germans have all the money in the\nworld and there is no reason why you should not get some of it. We could\ngive you information from time to time that the Germans would be\nprepared to pay for.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGustav drummed his fingers on the table. He took up a sheet of the now\nuseless report.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Germans are dangerous people to meddle with.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are a very intelligent man. And after all, even if your salary is\nstopped, you can always earn a bonus by bringing us news that can be\nuseful to us. But it will have to be substantiated; in future we pay\nonly by results.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will think of it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a moment or two Ashenden left Gustav to his reflections. He lit a\ncigarette and watched the smoke he had inhaled fade into the air. He\nthought too.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is there anything particular you want to know?\" asked Gustav suddenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be worth a couple of thousand Swiss francs to you if you could\ntell me what the Germans are doing with a spy of theirs in Lucerne. He\nis an Englishman and his name is Grantley Caypor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have heard the name,\" said Gustav. He paused a moment. \"How long are\nyou staying here?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As long as necessary. I will take a room at the hotel and let you know\nthe number. If you have anything to say to me you can be sure of finding\nme in my room at nine every morning and at seven every night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should not risk coming to the hotel. But I can write.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden rose to go and Gustav accompanied him to the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We part without ill-feeling then?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course. Your reports will remain in our archives as models of what a\nreport should be.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden spent two or three days visiting Basle. It did not much amuse\nhim. He passed a good deal of time in the book-shops turning over the\npages of books that would have been worth reading if life were a\nthousand years long. Once he saw Gustav in the street. On the fourth\nmorning a letter was brought up with his coffee. The envelope was that\nof a commercial firm unknown to him and inside it was a typewritten\nsheet. There was no address and no signature. Ashenden wondered if\nGustav was aware that a typewriter could betray its owner as certainly\nas a handwriting. Having twice carefully read the letter, he held the\npaper up to the light to see the watermark (he had no reason for doing\nthis except that the sleuths of detective novels always did it), then\nstruck a match and watched it burn. He scrunched up the charred\nfragments in his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got up, for he had taken advantage of his situation to breakfast in\nbed, packed his bag and took the next train to Berne. From there he was\nable to send a code telegram to R. His instructions were given to him\nverbally two days later, in the bedroom of his hotel at an hour when no\none was likely to be seen walking along a corridor, and within\ntwenty-four hours, though by a circuitous route, he arrived at Lucerne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHaving taken a room at the hotel at which he had been instructed to\nstay, Ashenden went out; it was a lovely day, early in August, and the\nsun shone in an unclouded sky. He had not been to Lucerne since he was a\nboy and but vaguely remembered a covered bridge, a great stone lion and\na church in which he had sat, bored yet impressed, while they played an\norgan; and, now wandering along a shady quay (and the lake looked just\nas tawdry and unreal as it looked on the picture-postcards) he tried not\nso much to find his way about a half-forgotten scene as to reform in his\nmind some recollection of the shy and eager lad, so impatient for life\n(which he saw not in the present of his adolescence but only in the\nfuture of his manhood) who so long ago had wandered there. But it seemed\nto him that the most vivid of his memories was not of himself, but of\nthe crowd; he seemed to remember sun and heat and people; the train was\ncrowded and so was the hotel, the lake steamers were packed and on the\nquays and in the streets you threaded your way among the throng of\nholiday-makers. They were fat and old and ugly and odd, and they stank.\nNow, in war-time, Lucerne was as deserted as it must have been before\nthe world at large discovered that Switzerland was the playground of\nEurope. Most of the hotels were closed, the streets were empty, the\nrowing boats for hire rocked idly at the water's edge and there was none\nto take them, and in the avenues by the lake the only persons to be seen\nwere serious Swiss taking their neutrality, like a dachshund, for a walk\nwith them. Ashenden felt exhilarated by the solitude and, sitting down\non a bench that faced the water, surrendered himself deliberately to the\nsensation. It was true that the lake was absurd, the water was too blue,\nthe mountains too snowy, and its beauty, hitting you in the face,\nexasperated rather than thrilled; but all the same there was something\npleasing in the prospect, an artless candour, like one of Mendelssohn's\n<i>Songs Without Words</i>, that made Ashenden smile with complacency.\nLucerne reminded him of wax flowers under glass cases and cuckoo clocks\nand fancy-work in Berlin wool. So long at all events as the fine weather\nlasted he was prepared to enjoy himself. He did not see why he should\nnot at least try to combine pleasure to himself with profit to his\ncountry. He was travelling with a brand-new passport in his pocket,\nunder a borrowed name, and this gave him an agreeable sense of owning a\nnew personality. He was often slightly tired of himself and it diverted\nhim for a while to be merely a creature of R.'s facile invention. The\nexperience he had just enjoyed appealed to his acute sense of the\nabsurd. R., it is true, had not seen the fun of it: what humour R.\npossessed was of a sardonic turn and he had no facility for taking in\ngood part a joke at his own expense. To do that you must be able to look\nat yourself from the outside and be at the same time spectator and actor\nin the pleasant comedy of life. R. was a soldier and regarded\nintrospection as unhealthy, un-English and unpatriotic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden got up and strolled slowly to his hotel. It was a small German\nhotel, of the second class, spotlessly clean, and his bedroom had a nice\nview; it was furnished with brightly varnished pitch-pine, and though on\na cold wet day it would have been wretched, in that warm and sunny\nweather it was gay and pleasing. There were tables in the hall and he\nsat down at one of these and ordered a bottle of beer. The landlady was\ncurious to know why in that dead season he had come to stay and he was\nglad to satisfy her curiosity. He told her that he had recently\nrecovered from an attack of typhoid and had come to Lucerne to get back\nhis strength. He was employed in the Censorship Department and was\ntaking the opportunity to brush up his rusty German. He asked her if she\ncould recommend to him a German teacher. The landlady was a blond and\nblowsy Swiss, good-humoured and talkative, so that Ashenden felt pretty\nsure that she would repeat in the proper quarter the information he gave\nher. It was his turn now to ask a few questions. She was voluble on the\nsubject of the war on account of which the hotel, in that month so full\nthat rooms had to be found for visitors in neighbouring houses, was\nnearly empty. A few people came in from outside to eat their meals <i>en\npension</i> but she had only two lots of resident guests. One was an old\nIrish couple who lived in Vevey and passed their summers in Lucerne and\nthe other was an Englishman and his wife. She was a German and they were\nobliged on that account to live in a neutral country. Ashenden took care\nto show little curiosity about them--he recognised in the description\nGrantley Caypor--but of her own accord she told him that they spent most\nof the day walking about the mountains. Herr Caypor was a botanist and\nmuch interested in the flora of the country. His lady was a very nice\nwoman and she felt her position keenly. Ah, well, the war could not last\nfor ever. The landlady bustled away and Ashenden went upstairs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDinner was at seven, and, wishing to be in the dining-room before anyone\nelse so that he could take stock of his fellow-guests as they entered,\nhe went down as soon as he heard the bell. It was a very plain, stiff,\nwhitewashed room, with chairs of the same shiny pitch-pine as in his\nbedroom, and on the walls were oleographs of Swiss lakes. On each little\ntable was a bunch of flowers. It was all neat and clean and presaged a\nbad dinner. Ashenden would have liked to make up for it by ordering a\nbottle of the best Rhine wine to be found in the hotel, but did not\nventure to draw attention to himself by extravagance (he saw on two or\nthree tables half-empty bottles of table hock, which made him surmise\nthat his fellow-guests drank thriftily), and so contented himself with\nordering a pint of lager. Presently one or two persons came in, single\nmen with some occupation in Lucerne and obviously Swiss, and sat down\neach at his own little table and untied the napkins that at the end of\nluncheon they had neatly tied up. They propped newspapers against their\nwaterjugs and read while they somewhat noisily ate their soup. Then\nentered a very old tall bent man, with white hair and a drooping white\nmoustache, accompanied by a little old white-haired lady in black. These\nwere certainly the Irish colonel and his wife of whom the landlady had\nspoken. They took their seats and the colonel poured out a thimbleful of\nwine for his wife and a thimbleful for himself. They waited in silence\nfor their dinner to be served to them by the buxom, hearty maid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last the persons arrived for whom Ashenden had been waiting. He was\ndoing his best to read a German book and it was only by an exercise of\nself-control that he allowed himself only for one instant to raise his\neyes as they came in. His glance showed him a man of about forty-five\nwith short dark hair, somewhat grizzled, of middle height, but\ncorpulent, with a broad red clean-shaven face. He wore a shirt open at\nthe neck, with a wide collar, and a grey suit. He walked ahead of his\nwife, and of her Ashenden only caught the impression of a German woman\nself-effaced and dusty. Grantley Caypor sat down and began in a loud\nvoice explaining to the waitress that they had taken an immense walk.\nThey had been up some mountain the name of which meant nothing to\nAshenden, but which excited in the maid expressions of astonishment and\nenthusiasm. Then Caypor, still in fluent German but with a marked\nEnglish accent, said that they were so late they had not even gone up to\nwash, but had just rinsed their hands outside. He had a resonant voice\nand a jovial manner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Serve me quick, we're starving with hunger, and bring beer, bring three\nbottles. <i>Lieber Gott</i>, what a thirst I have!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe seemed to be a man of exuberant vitality. He brought into that dull,\noverclean dining-room the breath of life and everyone in it appeared on\na sudden more alert. He began to talk to his wife, in English, and\neverything he said could be heard by all; but presently she interrupted\nhim with a remark made in an undertone. Caypor stopped and Ashenden felt\nthat his eyes were turned in his direction. Mrs. Caypor had noticed the\narrival of a stranger and had drawn her husband's attention to it.\nAshenden turned the page of the book he was pretending to read, but he\nfelt that Caypor's gaze was fixed intently upon him. When he addressed\nhis wife again it was in so low a tone that Ashenden could not even tell\nwhat language he used, but when the maid brought them their soup Caypor,\nhis voice still low, asked her a question. It was plain that he was\nenquiring who Ashenden was. Ashenden could catch of the maid's reply but\nthe one word <i>länder</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne or two people finished their dinner and went out picking their\nteeth. The old Irish colonel and his old wife rose from their table and\nhe stood aside to let her pass. They had eaten their meal without\nexchanging a word. She walked slowly to the door; but the colonel\nstopped to say a word to a Swiss who might have been a local attorney,\nand when she reached it she stood there, bowed and with a sheep-like\nlook, patiently waiting for her husband to come and open it for her.\nAshenden realised that she had never opened a door for herself. She did\nnot know how to. In a minute the colonel with his old, old gait came to\nthe door and opened it; she passed out and he followed. The little\nincident offered a key to their whole lives, and from it Ashenden began\nto reconstruct their histories, circumstances and characters; but he\npulled himself up; he could not allow himself the luxury of creation. He\nfinished his dinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen he went into the hall he saw tied to the leg of a table a\nbull-terrier and in passing mechanically put down his hand to fondle the\ndog's drooping, soft ears. The landlady was standing at the foot of the\nstairs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Whose is this lovely beast?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He belongs to Herr Caypor. Fritzi, he is called. Herr Caypor says he\nhas a longer pedigree than the King of England.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFritzi rubbed himself against Ashenden's leg and with his nose sought\nthe palm of his hand. Ashenden went upstairs to fetch his hat, and when\nhe came down saw Caypor standing at the entrance of the hotel talking\nwith the landlady. From the sudden silence and their constrained manner\nhe guessed that Caypor had been making enquiries about him. When he\npassed between them, into the street, out of the corner of his eye he\nsaw Caypor give a suspicious stare. That frank, jovial red face bore\nthen a look of shifty cunning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden strolled along till he found a tavern where he could have his\ncoffee in the open and to compensate himself for the bottle of beer that\nhis sense of duty had urged him to drink at dinner ordered the best\nbrandy the house provided. He was pleased at last to have come face to\nface with the man of whom he had heard so much and in a day or two hoped\nto become acquainted with him. It is never very difficult to get to know\nanyone who has a dog. But he was in no hurry; he would let things take\ntheir course: with the object he had in view he could not afford to be\nhasty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden reviewed the circumstances. Grantley Caypor was an Englishman,\nborn according to his passport in Birmingham, and he was forty-two years\nof age. His wife, to whom he had been married for eleven years, was of\nGerman birth and parentage. That was public knowledge. Information about\nhis antecedents was contained in a private document. He had started\nlife, according to this, in a lawyer's office in Birmingham and then had\ndrifted into journalism. He had been connected with an English paper in\nCairo and with another in Shanghai. There he got into trouble for\nattempting to get money on false pretences and was sentenced to a short\nterm of imprisonment. All trace of him was lost for two years after his\nrelease, when he reappeared in a shipping-office in Marseilles. From\nthere, still in the shipping business, he went to Hamburg, where he\nmarried, and to London. In London he set up for himself in the export\nbusiness, but after some time failed and was made a bankrupt. He\nreturned to journalism. At the outbreak of war he was once more in the\nshipping business, and in August, 1914, was living quietly with his\nGerman wife at Southampton. In the beginning of the following year he\ntold his employers that owing to the nationality of his wife his\nposition was intolerable; they had no fault to find with him and,\nrecognising that he was in an awkward fix, granted his request that he\nshould be transferred to Genoa. Here he remained till Italy entered the\nwar, but then gave notice and with his papers in perfect order crossed\nthe border and took up his residence in Switzerland.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAll this indicated a man of doubtful honesty and unsettled disposition,\nwith no background and of no financial standing; but the facts were of\nno importance to anyone till it was discovered that Caypor, certainly\nfrom the beginning of the war and perhaps sooner, was in the service of\nthe German Intelligence Department. He had a salary of forty pounds a\nmonth. But though dangerous and wily no steps would have been taken to\ndeal with him if he had contented himself with transmitting such news as\nhe was able to get in Switzerland. He could do no great harm there and\nit might even be possible to make use of him to convey information that\nit was desirable to let the enemy have. He had no notion that anything\nwas known of him. His letters, and he received a good many, were closely\ncensored; there were few codes that the people who dealt with such\nmatters could not in the end decipher and it might be that sooner or\nlater through him it would be possible to lay hands on the organisation\nthat still flourished in England. But then he did something that drew\nR.'s attention to him. Had he known it none could have blamed him for\nshaking in his shoes: R. was not a very nice man to get on the wrong\nside of. Caypor scraped acquaintance in Zürich with a young Spaniard,\nGomez by name, who had lately entered the British secret service, by his\nnationality inspired him with confidence, and managed to worm out of him\nthe fact that he was engaged in espionage. Probably the Spaniard, with a\nvery human desire to seem important, had done no more than talk\nmysteriously; but on Caypor's information he was watched when he went to\nGermany and one day caught just as he was posting a letter in a code\nthat was eventually deciphered. He was tried, convicted and shot. It was\nbad enough to lose a useful and disinterested agent, but it entailed\nbesides the changing of a safe and simple code. R. was not pleased. But\nR. was not the man to let any desire of revenge stand in the way of his\nmain object, and it occurred to him that if Caypor was merely betraying\nhis country for money it might be possible to get him to take more money\nto betray his employers. The fact that he had succeeded in delivering\ninto their hands an agent of the Allies must seem to them an earnest of\nhis good faith. He might be very useful. But R. had no notion what kind\nof man Caypor was, he had lived his shabby, furtive life obscurely, and\nthe only photograph that existed of him was one taken for a passport.\nAshenden's instructions were to get acquainted with Caypor and see\nwhether there was any chance that he would work honestly for the\nBritish: if he thought there was, he was entitled to sound him and if\nhis suggestions were met with favour to make certain propositions. It\nwas a task that needed tact and a knowledge of men. If on the other hand\nAshenden came to the conclusion that Caypor could not be bought, he was\nto watch and report his movements. The information he had obtained from\nGustav was vague, but important; there was only one point in it that was\ninteresting, and this was that the head of the German Intelligence\nDepartment in Berne was growing restive at Caypor's lack of activity.\nCaypor was asking for a higher salary and Major von P. had told him that\nhe must earn it. It might be that he was urging him to go to England. If\nhe could be induced to cross the frontier Ashenden's work was done.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How the devil do you expect <i>me</i> to persuade him to put his head in a\nnoose?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It won't be a noose, it'll be a firing squad,\" said R.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Caypor's clever.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, be cleverer, damn your eyes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden made up his mind that he would take no steps to make Caypor's\nacquaintance, but allow the first advances to be made by him. If he was\nbeing pressed for results it must surely occur to him that it would be\nworth while to get into conversation with an Englishman who was employed\nin the Censorship Department. Ashenden was prepared with a supply of\ninformation that it could not in the least benefit the Central Powers to\npossess. With a false name and a false passport he had little to fear\nthat Caypor would guess that he was a British agent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden did not have to wait long. Next day he was sitting in the\ndoorway of the hotel, drinking a cup of coffee and already half asleep\nafter a substantial <i>mittagessen</i>, when the Caypors came out of the\ndining-room. Mrs. Caypor went upstairs and Caypor released his dog. The\ndog bounded along and in a friendly fashion leaped up against Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come here, Fritzi,\" cried Caypor, and then to Ashenden: \"I'm so sorry.\nBut he's quite gentle.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, that's all right. He won't hurt me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCaypor stopped at the doorway.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's a bull-terrier. You don't often see them on the Continent.\" He\nseemed while he spoke to be taking Ashenden's measure; he called to the\nmaid: \"A coffee, please, <i>fräulein</i>. You've just arrived, haven't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I came yesterday.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Really? I didn't see you in the dining-room last night. Are you making\na stay?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. I've been ill and I've come here to recuperate.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe maid came with the coffee and seeing Caypor talking to Ashenden put\nthe tray on the table at which he was sitting. Caypor gave a laugh of\nfaint embarrassment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want to force myself upon you. I don't know why the maid put my\ncoffee on your table.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Please sit down,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's very good of you. I've lived so long on the Continent that I'm\nalways forgetting that my countrymen are apt to look upon it as\nconfounded cheek if you talk to them. Are you English, by the way, or\nAmerican?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"English,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was by nature a very shy person, and he had in vain tried to\ncure himself of a failing that at his age was unseemly, but on occasion\nhe knew how to make effective use of it. He explained now in a\nhesitating and awkward manner the facts that he had the day before told\nthe landlady and that he was convinced she had already passed on to\nCaypor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You couldn't have come to a better place than Lucerne. It's an oasis of\npeace in this war-weary world. When you're here you might almost forget\nthat there is such a thing as a war going on. That is why I've come\nhere. I'm a journalist by profession.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I couldn't help wondering if you wrote,\" said Ashenden, with an eagerly\ntimid smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was clear that he had not learnt that 'oasis of peace in a war-weary\nworld' at the shipping-office.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see, I married a German lady,\" said Caypor gravely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, really?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think anyone could be more patriotic than I am. I'm English\nthrough and through and I don't mind telling you that in my opinion the\nBritish Empire is the greatest instrument for good that the world has\never seen, but having a German wife I naturally see a good deal of the\nreverse of the medal. You don't have to tell me that the Germans have\nfaults, but frankly I'm not prepared to admit that they're devils\nincarnate. At the beginning of the war my poor wife had a very rough\ntime in England and I for one couldn't have blamed her if she'd felt\nrather bitter about it. Everyone thought she was a spy. It'll make you\nlaugh when you know her. She's the typical German <i>hausfrau</i> who cares\nfor nothing but her house and her husband and our only child Fritzi.\"\nCaypor fondled his dog and gave a little laugh. \"Yes, Fritzi, you are\nour child, aren't you? Naturally it made my position very awkward. I was\nconnected with some very important papers, and my editors weren't quite\ncomfortable about it. Well, to cut a long story short I thought the most\ndignified course was to resign and come to a neutral country till the\nstorm blew over. My wife and I never discuss the war, though I'm bound\nto tell you that it's more on my account than hers, she's much more\ntolerant than I am and she's more willing to look upon this terrible\nbusiness from my point of view than I am from hers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is strange,\" said Ashenden. \"As a rule women are so much more\nrabid than men.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My wife is a very remarkable person. I should like to introduce you to\nher. By the way, I don't know if you know my name. Grantley Caypor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My name is Somerville,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe told him then of the work he had been doing in the Censorship\nDepartment, and he fancied that into Caypor's eyes came a certain\nintentness. Presently he told him that he was looking for someone to\ngive him conversation-lessons in German so that he might rub up his\nrusty knowledge of the language; and as he spoke a notion flashed across\nhis mind: he gave Caypor a look and saw that the same notion had come to\nhim. It had occurred to them at the same instant that it would be a very\ngood plan for Ashenden's teacher to be Mrs. Caypor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I asked our landlady if she could find me someone and she said she\nthought she could. I must ask her again. It ought not to be very hard to\nfind a man who is prepared to come and talk German to me for an hour a\nday.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't take anyone on the landlady's recommendation,\" said Caypor.\n\"After all you want someone with a good North-German accent and she only\ntalks Swiss. I'll ask my wife if she knows anyone. My wife's a very\nhighly educated woman and you could trust her recommendation.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's very kind of you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden observed Grantley Caypor at his ease. He noticed how the small,\ngrey-green eyes, which last night he had not been able to see,\ncontradicted the red good-humoured frankness of the face. They were\nquick and shifty, but when the mind behind them was seized by an\nunexpected notion they were suddenly still. It gave one a peculiar\nfeeling of the working of the brain. They were not eyes that inspired\nconfidence; Caypor did that with his jolly, good-natured smile, the\nopenness of his broad, weather-beaten face, his comfortable obesity and\nthe cheeriness of his loud, deep voice. He was doing his best now to be\nagreeable. While Ashenden talked to him, a little shyly still but\ngaining confidence from that breezy, cordial manner, capable of putting\nanyone at his ease, it intrigued him to remember that the man was a\ncommon spy. It gave a tang to his conversation to reflect that he had\nbeen ready to sell his country for no more than forty pounds a month.\nAshenden had known Gomez, the young Spaniard whom Caypor had betrayed.\nHe was a high-spirited youth, with a love of adventure, and he had\nundertaken his dangerous mission not for the money he earned by it, but\nfrom a passion for romance. It amused him to outwit the clumsy German\nand it appealed to his sense of the absurd to play a part in a shilling\nshocker. It was not very nice to think of him now six feet underground\nin a prison yard. He was young and he had a certain grace of gesture.\nAshenden wondered whether Caypor had felt a qualm when he delivered him\nup to destruction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you know a little German?\" asked Caypor, interested in the\nstranger.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, yes, I was a student in Germany, and I used to talk it fluently,\nbut that is long ago and I have forgotten. I can still read it very\ncomfortably.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, yes, I noticed you were reading a German book last night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFool! It was only a little while since he had told Ashenden that he had\nnot seen him at dinner. He wondered whether Caypor had observed the\nslip. How difficult it was never to make one! Ashenden must be on his\nguard; the thing that made him most nervous was the thought that he\nmight not answer readily enough to his assumed name of Somerville. Of\ncourse there was always the chance that Caypor had made the slip on\npurpose to see by Ashenden's face whether he noticed anything. Caypor\ngot up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is my wife. We go for a walk up one of the mountains every\nafternoon. I can tell you some charming walks. The flowers even now are\nlovely.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I must wait till I'm a bit stronger,\" said Ashenden, with a\nlittle sigh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had naturally a pale face and never looked as robust as he was. Mrs.\nCaypor came downstairs and her husband joined her. They walked down the\nroad, Fritzi bounding round them, and Ashenden saw that Caypor\nimmediately began to speak with volubility. He was evidently telling his\nwife the results of his interview with Ashenden. Ashenden looked at the\nsun shining so gaily on the lake; the shadow of a breeze fluttered the\ngreen leaves of the trees; everything invited to a stroll: he got up,\nwent to his room and throwing himself on his bed had a very pleasant\nsleep.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went into dinner that evening as the Caypors were finishing, for he\nhad wandered melancholically about Lucerne in the hope of finding a\ncocktail that would enable him to face the potato salad that he foresaw,\nand on their way out of the dining-room Caypor stopped and asked him if\nhe would drink coffee with them. When Ashenden joined them in the hall\nCaypor got up and introduced him to his wife. She bowed stiffly and no\nanswering smile came to her face to respond to Ashenden's civil\ngreeting. It was not hard to see that her attitude was definitely\nhostile. It put Ashenden at his ease. She was a plainish woman, nearing\nforty, with a muddy skin and vague features; her drab hair was arranged\nin a plait round her head like that of Napoleon's Queen of Prussia; and\nshe was squarely built, plump rather than fat, and solid. But she did\nnot look stupid; she looked, on the contrary, a woman of character and\nAshenden, who had lived enough in Germany to recognise the type, was\nready to believe that though capable of doing the housework, cooking the\ndinner and climbing a mountain, she might be also prodigiously\nwell-informed. She wore a white blouse that showed a sunburned neck, a\nblack skirt and heavy walking boots. Caypor addressing her in English\ntold her in his jovial way, as though she did not know it already, what\nAshenden had told him about himself. She listened grimly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think you told me you understood German,\" said Caypor, his big red\nface wreathed in polite smiles but his little eyes darting about\nrestlessly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I was for some time a student in Heidelberg.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Really?\" said Mrs. Caypor in English, an expression of faint interest\nfor a moment chasing away the sullenness from her face. \"I know\nHeidelberg very well. I was at school there for one year.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer English was correct, but throaty, and the mouthing emphasis she gave\nher words was disagreeable. Ashenden was diffuse in praise of the old\nuniversity town and the beauty of the neighbourhood. She heard him, from\nthe standpoint of her Teutonic superiority, with toleration rather than\nwith enthusiasm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is well known that the valley of the Neckar is one of the beauty\nplaces of the whole world,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have not told you, my dear,\" said Caypor then, \"that Mr. Somerville\nis looking for someone to give him conversation lessons while he is\nhere. I told him that perhaps you could suggest a teacher.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I know no one whom I could conscientiously recommend,\" she\nanswered. \"The Swiss accent is hateful beyond words. It could do Mr.\nSomerville only harm to converse with a Swiss.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If I were in your place, Mr. Somerville, I would try and persuade my\nwife to give you lessons. She is, if I may say so, a very cultivated and\nhighly educated woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Ach</i>, Grantley, I have not the time. I have my own work to do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden saw that he was being given his opportunity. The trap was\nprepared and all he had to do was to fall in. He turned to Mrs. Caypor\nwith a manner that he tried to make shy, deprecating and modest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course it would be too wonderful if you would give me lessons. I\nshould look upon it as a real privilege. Naturally I wouldn't want to\ninterfere with your work. I am just here to get well, with nothing in\nthe world to do, and I would suit my time entirely to your convenience.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe felt a flash of satisfaction pass from one to the other and in Mrs.\nCaypor's blue eyes he fancied that he saw a dark glow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course it would be a purely business arrangement,\" said Caypor.\n\"There's no reason that my good wife shouldn't earn a little pin-money.\nWould you think ten francs an hour too much?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No,\" said Ashenden, \"I should think myself lucky to get a first-rate\nteacher for that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you say, my dear? Surely you can spare an hour, and you would\nbe doing this gentleman a kindness. He would learn that all Germans are\nnot the devilish fiends that they think them in England.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn Mrs. Caypor's brow was an uneasy frown and Ashenden could not but\nthink with apprehension of that hour's conversation a day that he was\ngoing to exchange with her. Heaven only knew how he would have to rack\nhis brain for subjects of discourse with that heavy and morose woman.\nNow she made a visible effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall be very pleased to give Mr. Somerville conversation lessons.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I congratulate you, Mr. Somerville,\" said Caypor noisily. \"You're in\nfor a treat. When will you start, to-morrow at eleven?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That would suit me very well if it suits Mrs. Caypor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, that is as good an hour as another,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden left them to discuss the happy outcome of their diplomacy. But\nwhen, punctually at eleven next morning, he heard a knock at his door\n(for it had been arranged that Mrs. Caypor should give him his lesson in\nhis room) it was not without trepidation that he opened it. It behoved\nhim to be frank, a trifle indiscreet, but obviously wary of a German\nwoman, sufficiently intelligent, and impulsive. Mrs. Caypor's face was\ndark and sulky. She plainly hated having anything to do with him. But\nthey sat down and she began, somewhat peremptorily, to ask him questions\nabout his knowledge of German literature. She corrected his mistakes\nwith exactness and when he put before her some difficulty in German\nconstruction explained it with clearness and precision. It was obvious\nthat though she hated giving him a lesson she meant to give it\nconscientiously. She seemed to have not only an aptitude for teaching,\nbut a love of it, and as the hour went on she began to speak with\ngreater earnestness. It was already only by an effort that she\nremembered that he was a brutal Englishman. Ashenden, noticing the\nunconscious struggle within her, found himself not a little entertained;\nand it was with truth that, when later in the day Caypor asked him how\nthe lesson had gone, he answered that it was highly satisfactory; Mrs.\nCaypor was an excellent teacher and a most interesting person.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I told you so. She's the most remarkable woman I know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd Ashenden had a feeling that when in his hearty, laughing way Caypor\nsaid this he was for the first time entirely sincere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn a day or two Ashenden guessed that Mrs. Caypor was giving him lessons\nonly in order to enable Caypor to arrive at a closer intimacy with him,\nfor she confined herself strictly to matters of literature, music and\npainting; and when Ashenden, by way of experiment, brought the\nconversation round to the war, she cut him short.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think that is a topic that we had better avoid, Herr Somerville,\" she\nsaid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe continued to give her lessons with the greatest thoroughness, and he\nhad his money's worth, but every day she came with the same sullen face\nand it was only in the interest of teaching that she lost for a moment\nher instinctive dislike of him. Ashenden exercised in turn, but in vain,\nall his wiles. He was ingratiating, ingenuous, humble, grateful,\nflattering, simple and timid. She remained coldly hostile. She was a\nfanatic. Her patriotism was aggressive, but disinterested, and obsessed\nwith the notion of the superiority of all things German she loathed\nEngland with a virulent hatred because in that country she saw the chief\nobstacle to their diffusion. Her ideal was a German world in which the\nrest of the nations under a hegemony greater than that of Rome should\nenjoy the benefits of German science and German art and German culture.\nThere was in the conception a magnificent impudence that appealed to\nAshenden's sense of humour. She was no fool. She had read much, in\nseveral languages, and she could talk of the books she had read with\ngood sense. She had a knowledge of modern painting and modern music that\nnot a little impressed Ashenden. It was amusing once to hear her before\nluncheon play one of those silvery little pieces of Debussy; she played\nit disdainfully because it was French and so light, but with an angry\nappreciation of its grace and gaiety. When Ashenden congratulated her\nshe shrugged her shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The decadent music of a decadent nation,\" she said. Then with powerful\nhands she struck the first resounding chords of a sonata by Beethoven;\nbut she stopped. \"I cannot play, I am out of practice, and you English,\nwhat do you know of music? You have not produced a composer since\nPurcell!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you think of that statement?\" Ashenden, smiling, asked Caypor,\nwho was standing near.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I confess its truth. The little I know of music my wife taught me. I\nwish you could hear her play when she is in practice.\" He put his fat\nhand, with its square, stumpy fingers, on her shoulder. \"She can wring\nyour heart-strings with pure beauty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Dummer Kerl</i>,\" she said, in a soft voice, \"Stupid fellow,\" and\nAshenden saw her mouth for a moment quiver, but she quickly recovered.\n\"You English, you cannot paint, you cannot model, you cannot write\nmusic.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Some of us can at times write pleasing verses,\" said Ashenden, with\ngood-humour, for it was not his business to be put out, and, he did not\nknow why, two lines occurring to him he said them:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <i>\"Whither, O splendid ship, thy white sails crowding,</i>\n<br>\n    <i>Leaning across the bosom of the urgent West.\"</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Caypor, with a strange gesture, \"you can write poetry.\nI wonder why.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd to Ashenden's surprise she went on, in her guttural English, to\nrecite the next two lines of the poem he had quoted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come, Grantley, <i>mittagessen</i> is ready, let us go into the\ndining-room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey left Ashenden reflective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden admired goodness, but was not outraged by wickedness. People\nsometimes thought him heartless because he was more often interested in\nothers than attached to them, and even in the few to whom he was\nattached his eyes saw with equal clearness the merits and the defects.\nWhen he liked people it was not because he was blind to their faults, he\ndid not mind their faults but accepted them with a tolerant shrug of the\nshoulders, or because he ascribed to them excellencies that they did not\npossess; and since he judged his friends with candour they never\ndisappointed him and so he seldom lost one. He asked from none more than\nhe could give. He was able to pursue his study of the Caypors without\nprejudice and without passion. Mrs. Caypor seemed to him more of a piece\nand therefore the easier of the two to understand; she obviously\ndetested him; though it was necessary for her to be civil to him her\nantipathy was strong enough to wring from her now and then an expression\nof rudeness; and had she been safely able to do so she would have killed\nhim without a qualm. But in the pressure of Caypor's chubby hand on his\nwife's shoulder and in the fugitive trembling of her lips Ashenden had\ndivined that this unprepossessing woman and that mean fat man were\njoined together by a deep and sincere love. It was touching. Ashenden\nassembled the observations that he had been making for the past few days\nand little things that he had noticed but to which he had attached no\nsignificance returned to him. It seemed to him that Mrs. Caypor loved\nher husband because she was of a stronger character than he and because\nshe felt his dependence on her; she loved him for his admiration of her,\nand you might guess that till she met him this dumpy, plain woman with\nher dullness, good sense and want of humour could not have much enjoyed\nthe admiration of men; she enjoyed his heartiness and his noisy jokes,\nand his high spirits stirred her sluggish blood; he was a great big\nbouncing boy and he would never be anything else and she felt like a\nmother towards him; she had made him what he was, and he was her man and\nshe was his woman, and she loved him, notwithstanding his weakness (for\nwith her clear head she must always have been conscious of that), she\nloved him, <i>ach, was</i>, as Isolde loved Tristan. But then there was the\nespionage. Even Ashenden with all his tolerance for human frailty could\nnot but feel that to betray your country for money is not a very pretty\nproceeding. Of course she knew of it, indeed it was probably through her\nthat Caypor had first been approached; he would never have undertaken\nsuch work if she had not urged him to it. She loved him and she was an\nhonest and an upright woman. By what devious means had she persuaded\nherself to force her husband to adopt so base and dishonourable a\ncalling? Ashenden lost himself in a labyrinth of conjecture as he tried\nto piece together the actions of her mind.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGrantley Caypor was another story. There was little to admire in him,\nbut at that moment Ashenden was not looking for an object of admiration;\nbut there was much that was singular and much that was unexpected in\nthat gross and vulgar fellow. Ashenden watched with entertainment the\nsuave manner in which the spy tried to inveigle him in his toils. It was\na couple of days after his first lesson that Caypor after dinner, his\nwife having gone upstairs, threw himself heavily into a chair by\nAshenden's side. His faithful Fritzi came up to him and put his long\nmuzzle with its black nose on his knee.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He has no brain,\" said Caypor, \"but a heart of gold. Look at those\nlittle pink eyes. Did you ever see anything so stupid? And what an ugly\nface, but what incredible charm!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you had him long?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I got him in 1914 just before the outbreak of war. By the way, what do\nyou think of the news to-day? Of course my wife and I never discuss the\nwar. You can't think what a relief to me it is to find a\nfellow-countryman to whom I can open my heart.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe handed Ashenden a cheap Swiss cigar and Ashenden, making a rueful\nsacrifice to duty, accepted it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course, they haven't got a chance, the Germans,\" said Caypor, \"not a\ndog's chance. I knew they were beaten the moment we came in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis manner was earnest, sincere and confidential. Ashenden made a\ncommonplace rejoinder.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's the greatest grief of my life that owing to my wife's nationality\nI was unable to do any war work. I tried to enlist the day war broke\nout, but they wouldn't have me on account of my age, but I don't mind\ntelling you, if the war goes on much longer, wife or no wife, I'm going\nto do something. With my knowledge of languages I ought to be of some\nservice in the Censorship Department. That's where you were, wasn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat was the mark at which he had been aiming and in answer now to his\nwell-directed questions Ashenden gave him the information that he had\nalready prepared. Caypor drew his chair a little nearer and dropped his\nvoice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sure you wouldn't tell me anything that anyone shouldn't know, but\nafter all these Swiss are absolutely pro-German and we don't want to\ngive anyone the chance of overhearing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he went on another tack. He told Ashenden a number of things that\nwere of a certain secrecy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't tell this to anybody else, you know, but I have one or two\nfriends who are in pretty influential positions, and they know they can\ntrust me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThus encouraged, Ashenden was a little more deliberately indiscreet and\nwhen they parted both had reason to be satisfied. Ashenden guessed that\nCaypor's typewriter would be kept busy next morning and that extremely\nenergetic Major in Berne would shortly receive a most interesting\nreport.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne evening, going upstairs after dinner, Ashenden passed an open\nbathroom. He caught sight of the Caypors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come in,\" cried Caypor in his cordial way. \"We're washing our Fritzi.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe bull-terrier was constantly getting himself very dirty, and it was\nCaypor's pride to see him clean and white. Ashenden went in. Mrs. Caypor\nwith her sleeves turned up and a large white apron was standing at one\nend of the bath, while Caypor, in a pair of trousers and a singlet, his\nfat, freckled arms bare, was soaping the wretched hound.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We have to do it at night,\" he said, \"because the Fitzgeralds use this\nbath and they'd have a fit if they knew we washed the dog in it. We wait\ntill they go to bed. Come along, Fritzi, show the gentleman how\nbeautifully you behave when you have your face scrubbed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe poor brute, woebegone but faintly wagging his tail to show that\nhowever foul was this operation performed on him he bore no malice to\nthe god who did it, was standing in the middle of the bath in six inches\nof water. He was soaped all over and Caypor, talking the while,\nshampooed him with his great fat hands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, what a beautiful dog he's going to be when he's as white as the\ndriven snow. His master will be as proud as Punch to walk out with him\nand all the little lady-dogs will say: Good gracious, who's that\nbeautiful aristocratic-looking bull-terrier walking as though he owned\nthe whole of Switzerland? Now stand still while you have your ears\nwashed. You couldn't bear to go out into the street with dirty ears,\ncould you? like a nasty little Swiss schoolboy. <i>Noblesse oblige.</i> Now\nthe black nose. Oh, and all the soap is going into his little pink eyes\nand they'll smart.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Caypor listened to this nonsense with a good-humoured sluggish\nsmile on her broad, plain face, and presently gravely took a towel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now he's going to have a ducking. Upsie-daisy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCaypor seized the dog by the fore-legs and ducked him once and ducked\nhim twice. There was a struggle, a flurry and a splashing. Caypor lifted\nhim out of the bath.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now go to mother and she'll dry you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Caypor sat down and taking the dog between her strong legs rubbed\nhim till the sweat poured off her forehead. And Fritzi, a little shaken\nand breathless, but happy it was all over, stood, with his sweet stupid\nface, white and shining.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Blood will tell,\" cried Caypor exultantly. \"He knows the names of no\nless than sixty-four of his ancestors, and they were all nobly born.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was faintly troubled. He shivered a little as he walked\nupstairs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen, one Sunday, Caypor told him that he and his wife were going on an\nexcursion and would eat their luncheon at some little mountain\nrestaurant; and he suggested that Ashenden, each paying his share,\nshould come with them. After three weeks at Lucerne Ashenden thought\nthat his strength would permit him to venture the exertion. They started\nearly, Mrs. Caypor business-like in her walking boots and Tyrolese hat\nand alpenstock, and Caypor in stockings and plus-fours looking very\nBritish. The situation amused Ashenden and he was prepared to enjoy his\nday; but he meant to keep his eyes open; it was not inconceivable that\nthe Caypors had discovered what he was and it would not do to go too\nnear a precipice; Mrs. Caypor would not hesitate to give him a push and\nCaypor for all his jolliness was an ugly customer. But on the face of it\nthere was nothing to mar Ashenden's pleasure in the golden morning. The\nair was fragrant. Caypor was full of conversation. He told funny\nstories. He was gay and jovial. The sweat rolled off his great red face\nand he laughed at himself because he was so fat. To Ashenden's\nastonishment he showed a peculiar knowledge of the mountain flowers.\nOnce he went out of the way to pick one he saw a little distance from\nthe path and brought it back to his wife. He looked at it tenderly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Isn't it lovely?\" he cried, and his shifty grey-green eyes for a moment\nwere as candid as a child's. \"It's like a poem by Walter Savage Landor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Botany is my husband's favourite science,\" said Mrs. Caypor. \"I laugh\nat him sometimes. He is devoted to flowers. Often when we have hardly\nhad enough money to pay the butcher he has spent everything in his\npocket to bring me a bunch of roses.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Qui fleurit sa maison fleurit son coeur</i>,\" said Grantley Caypor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden had once or twice seen Caypor, coming in from a walk, offer\nMrs. Fitzgerald a nosegay of mountain flowers with an elephantine\ncourtesy that was not entirely displeasing; and what he had just learned\nadded a certain significance to the pretty little action. His passion\nfor flowers was genuine and when he gave them to the old Irish lady he\ngave her something he valued. It showed a real kindness of heart.\nAshenden had always thought botany a tedious science, but Caypor,\ntalking exuberantly as they walked along, was able to impart to it life\nand interest. He must have given it a good deal of study.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've never written a book,\" he said. \"There are too many books already\nand any desire to write I have is satisfied by the more immediately\nprofitable and quite ephemeral composition of an article for a daily\npaper. But if I stay here much longer I have half a mind to write a book\nabout the wild flowers of Switzerland. Oh, I wish you'd been here a\nlittle earlier. They were marvellous. But one wants to be a poet for\nthat, and I'm only a poor newspaper-man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was curious to observe how he was able to combine real emotion with\nfalse fact.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen they reached the inn, with its view of the mountains and the lake,\nit was good to see the sensual pleasure with which he poured down his\nthroat a bottle of ice-cold beer. You could not but feel sympathy for a\nman who took so much delight in simple things. They lunched deliciously\noff scrambled eggs and mountain trout. Even Mrs. Caypor was moved to an\nunwonted gentleness by her surroundings; the inn was in an agreeably\nrural spot, it looked like a picture of a Swiss chalet in a book of\nearly nineteenth-century travels; and she treated Ashenden with\nsomething less than her usual hostility. When they arrived she had burst\ninto loud German exclamations on the beauty of the scene, and now,\nsoftened perhaps too by food and drink, her eyes, dwelling on the\ngrandeur before her, filled with tears. She stretched out her hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is dreadful and I am ashamed, notwithstanding this horrible and\nunjust war I can feel in my heart at the moment nothing but happiness\nand gratitude.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCaypor took her hand and pressed it and, an unusual thing with him,\naddressing her in German, called her little pet-names. It was absurd,\nbut touching. Ashenden, leaving them to their emotions, strolled through\nthe garden and sat down on a bench that had been prepared for the\ncomfort of the tourist. The view was of course spectacular, but it\ncaptured you; it was like a piece of music that was obvious and\nmeretricious, but for the moment shattered your self-control.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd as Ashenden lingered idly in that spot he pondered over the mystery\nof Grantley Caypor's treachery. If he liked strange people he had found\nin him one who was strange beyond belief. It would be foolish to deny\nthat he had amiable traits. His joviality was not assumed, he was\nwithout pretence a hearty fellow, and he had real good nature. He was\nalways ready to do a kindness. Ashenden had often watched him with the\nold Irish colonel and his wife who were the only other residents of the\nhotel; he would listen good-humouredly to the old man's tedious stories\nof the Egyptian war, and he was charming with her. Now that Ashenden had\narrived at terms of some familiarity with Caypor he found that he\nregarded him less with repulsion than with curiosity. He did not think\nthat he had become a spy merely for the money; he was a man of modest\ntastes and what he had earned in a shipping-office must have sufficed to\nso good a manager as Mrs. Caypor; and after war was declared there was\nno lack of remunerative work for men over the military age. It might be\nthat he was one of those men who prefer devious ways to straight for\nsome intricate pleasure they get in fooling their fellows; and that he\nhad turned spy, not from hatred of the country that had imprisoned him,\nnot even from love of his wife, but from a desire to score off the\nbig-wigs who never even knew of his existence. It might be that it was\nvanity that impelled him, a feeling that his talents had not received\nthe recognition they merited, or just a puckish, impish desire to do\nmischief. He was a crook. It is true that only two cases of dishonesty\nhad been brought home to him, but if he had been caught twice it might\nbe surmised that he had often been dishonest without being caught. What\ndid Mrs. Caypor think of this? They were so united that she must be\naware of it. Did it make her ashamed, for her own uprightness surely\nnone could doubt, or did she accept it as an inevitable kink in the man\nshe loved? Did she do all she could to prevent it or did she close her\neyes to something she could not help?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHow much easier life would be if people were all black or all white and\nhow much simpler it would be to act in regard to them! Was Caypor a good\nman who loved evil or a bad man who loved good? And how could such\nunreconcilable elements exist side by side and in harmony within the\nsame heart? For one thing was clear, Caypor was disturbed by no gnawing\nof conscience; he did his mean and despicable work with gusto. He was a\ntraitor who enjoyed his treachery. Though Ashenden had been studying\nhuman nature more or less consciously all his life, it seemed to him\nthat he knew as little about it now in middle age as he had done when he\nwas a child. Of course R. would have said to him: Why the devil do you\nwaste your time with such nonsense? The man's a dangerous spy and your\nbusiness is to lay him by the heels.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat was true enough. Ashenden had decided that it would be useless to\nattempt to make any arrangement with Caypor. Though doubtless he would\nhave no feeling about betraying his employers he could certainly not be\ntrusted. His wife's influence was too strong. Besides, notwithstanding\nwhat he had from time to time told Ashenden, he was in his heart\nconvinced that the Central Powers must win the war, and he meant to be\non the winning side. Well, then Caypor must be laid by the heels, but\nhow he was to effect that Ashenden had no notion. Suddenly he heard a\nvoice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There you are. We've been wondering where you had hidden yourself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked round and saw the Caypors strolling towards him. They were\nwalking hand in hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So this is what has kept you so quiet,\" said Caypor as his eyes fell on\nthe view. \"What a spot!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Caypor clasped her hands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Ach Gott, wie schön!</i>\" she cried. \"<i>Wie schön.</i> When I look at that\nblue lake and those snowy mountains I feel inclined, like Goethe's\nFaust, to cry to the passing moment: Tarry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is better than being in England with the excursions and alarums of\nwar, isn't it?\" said Caypor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Much,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, did you have any difficulty in getting out?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, not the smallest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm told they make rather a nuisance of themselves at the frontier\nnowadays.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I came through without the smallest difficulty. I don't fancy they\nbother much about the English. I thought the examination of passports\nwas quite perfunctory.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA fleeting glance passed between Caypor and his wife. Ashenden wondered\nwhat it meant. It would be strange if Caypor's thoughts were occupied\nwith the chances of a journey to England at the very moment when he was\nhimself reflecting on its possibility. In a little while Mrs. Caypor\nsuggested that they had better be starting back and they wandered\ntogether in the shade of trees down the mountain paths.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was watchful. He could do nothing (and his inactivity irked\nhim) but wait with his eyes open to seize the opportunity that might\npresent itself. A couple of days later an incident occurred that made\nhim certain something was in the wind. In the course of his morning\nlesson Mrs. Caypor remarked:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My husband has gone to Geneva to-day. He had some business to do\nthere.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh,\" said Ashenden, \"will he be gone long?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, only two days.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt is not everyone who can tell a lie and Ashenden had the feeling, he\nhardly knew why, that Mrs. Caypor was telling one then. Her manner\nperhaps was not quite as indifferent as you would have expected when she\nwas mentioning a fact that could be of no interest to Ashenden. It\nflashed across his mind that Caypor had been summoned to Berne to see\nthe redoubtable head of the German secret service. When he had the\nchance he said casually to the waitress:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A little less work for you to do, <i>fräulein</i>. I hear that Herr Caypor\nhas gone to Berne.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. But he'll be back to-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat proved nothing, but it was something to go upon. Ashenden knew in\nLucerne a Swiss who was willing on emergency to do odd jobs and, looking\nhim up, asked him to take a letter to Berne. It might be possible to\npick up Caypor and trace his movements. Next day Caypor appeared once\nmore with his wife at the dinner-table, but merely nodded to Ashenden\nand afterwards both went straight upstairs. They looked troubled.\nCaypor, as a rule so animated, walked with bowed shoulders and looked\nneither to the right nor to the left. Next morning Ashenden received a\nreply to his letter: Caypor had seen Major von P. It was possible to\nguess what the Major had said to him. Ashenden well knew how rough he\ncould be; he was a hard man and brutal, clever and unscrupulous, and he\nwas not accustomed to mince his words. They were tired of paying Caypor\na salary to sit still in Lucerne and do nothing; the time was come for\nhim to go to England. Guess-work? Of course it was guess-work, but in\nthat trade it mostly was; you had to deduce the animal from its\njaw-bone. Ashenden knew from Gustav that the Germans wanted to send\nsomeone to England. He drew a long breath; if Caypor went he would have\nto get busy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Mrs. Caypor came in to give him his lesson she was dull and\nlistless. She looked tired and her mouth was set obstinately. It\noccurred to Ashenden that the Caypors had spent most of the night\ntalking. He wished he knew what they had said. Did she urge him to go or\ndid she try to dissuade him? Ashenden watched them again at luncheon.\nSomething was the matter, for they hardly spoke to one another and as a\nrule they found plenty to talk about. They left the room early, but when\nAshenden went out he saw Caypor sitting in the hall by himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa,\" he cried jovially, but surely the effort was patent, \"how are\nyou getting on? I've been to Geneva.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So I heard,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come and have your coffee with me. My poor wife's got a headache. I\ntold her she'd better go and lie down.\" In his shifty green eyes was an\nexpression that Ashenden could not read. \"The fact is, she's rather\nworried, poor dear; I'm thinking of going to England.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden's heart gave a sudden leap against his ribs, but his face\nremained impassive:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, are you going for long? We shall miss you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To tell you the truth, I'm fed up with doing nothing. The war looks as\nthough it were going on for years and I can't sit here indefinitely.\nBesides, I can't afford it, I've got to earn my living. I may have a\nGerman wife, but I am an Englishman, hang it all, and I want to do my\nbit. I could never face my friends again if I just stayed here in ease\nand comfort till the end of the war and never attempted to do a thing to\nhelp the country. My wife takes her German point of view and I don't\nmind telling you that she's a bit upset. You know what women are.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow Ashenden knew what it was that he saw in Caypor's eyes. Fear. It\ngave him a nasty turn. Caypor didn't want to go to England, he wanted to\nstay safely in Switzerland; Ashenden knew now what the major had said to\nhim when he went to see him in Berne. He had got to go or lose his\nsalary. What was it that his wife had said when he told her what had\nhappened? He had wanted her to press him to stay, but, it was plain, she\nhadn't done that; perhaps he had not dared tell her how frightened he\nwas; to her he had always been gay, bold, adventurous and\ndevil-may-care; and now, the prisoner of his own lies, he had not found\nit in him to confess himself the mean and sneaking coward he was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you going to take your wife with you?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, she'll stay here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt had been arranged very neatly. Mrs. Caypor would receive his letters\nand forward the information they contained to Berne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've been out of England so long that I don't quite know how to set\nabout getting war-work. What would you do in my place?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know; what sort of work are you thinking of?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you know, I imagine I could do the same thing as you did. I\nwonder if there's anyone in the Censorship Department that you could\ngive me a letter of introduction to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was only by a miracle that Ashenden saved himself from showing by a\nsmothered cry or by a broken gesture how startled he was; but not by\nCaypor's request, by what had just dawned upon him. What an idiot he had\nbeen! He had been disturbed by the thought that he was wasting his time\nat Lucerne, he was doing nothing, and though in fact, as it turned out,\nCaypor was going to England it was due to no cleverness of his. He could\ntake to himself no credit for the result. And now he saw that he had\nbeen put in Lucerne, told how to describe himself and given the proper\ninformation, so that what actually had occurred should occur. It would\nbe a wonderful thing for the German secret service to get an agent into\nthe Censorship Department; and by a happy accident there was Grantley\nCaypor, the very man for the job, on friendly terms with someone who had\nworked there. What a bit of luck! Major von P. was a man of culture and,\nrubbing his hands, he must surely have murmured: <i>stultum facit fortuna\nquem vult perdere</i>. It was a trap of that devilish R. and the grim major\nat Berne had fallen into it. Ashenden had done his work just by sitting\nstill and doing nothing. He almost laughed as he thought what a fool R.\nhad made of him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was on very good terms with the chief of my department, I could give\nyou a note to him if you liked.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That would be just the thing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But of course I must give the facts. I must say I've met you here and\nonly known you a fortnight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course. But you'll say what else you can for me, won't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, certainly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know yet if I can get a visa. I'm told they're rather fussy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't see why. I shall be very sick if they refuse me one when I want\nto go back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll go and see how my wife is getting on,\" said Caypor suddenly,\ngetting up. \"When will you let me have that letter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Whenever you like. Are you going at once?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As soon as possible.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCaypor left him. Ashenden waited in the hall for a quarter of an hour so\nthat there should appear in him no sign of hurry. Then he went upstairs\nand prepared various communications. In one he informed R. that Caypor\nwas going to England; in another he made arrangements through Berne that\nwherever Caypor applied for a visa it should be granted to him without\nquestion; and these he despatched forthwith. When he went down to dinner\nhe handed Caypor a cordial letter of introduction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext day but one Caypor left Lucerne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden waited. He continued to have his hour's lesson with Mrs. Caypor\nand under her conscientious tuition began now to speak German with ease.\nThey talked of Goethe and Winckelmann, of art and life and travel.\nFritzi sat quietly by her chair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He misses his master,\" she said, pulling his ears. \"He only really\ncares for him, he suffers me only as belonging to him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter his lesson Ashenden went every morning to Cook's to ask for his\nletters. It was here that all communications were addressed to him. He\ncould not move till he received instructions, but R. could be trusted\nnot to leave him idle long; and meanwhile there was nothing for him to\ndo but have patience. Presently he received a letter from the consul in\nGeneva to say that Caypor had there applied for his visa and had set out\nfor France. Having read this Ashenden went on for a little stroll by the\nlake and on his way back happened to see Mrs. Caypor coming out of\nCook's office. He guessed that she was having her letters addressed\nthere too. He went up to her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you had news of Herr Caypor?\" he asked her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No,\" she said. \"I suppose I could hardly expect to yet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe walked along by her side. She was disappointed, but not yet anxious;\nshe knew how irregular at that time was the post. But next day during\nthe lesson he could not but see that she was impatient to have done with\nit. The post was delivered at noon and at five minutes to she looked at\nher watch and him. Though Ashenden knew very well that no letter would\never come for her he had not the heart to keep her on tenter-hooks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you think that's enough for the day? I'm sure you want to go down\nto Cook's,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you. That is very amiable of you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen a little later he went there himself he found her standing in the\nmiddle of the office. Her face was distraught. She addressed him wildly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My husband promised to write from Paris. I am sure there is a letter\nfor me, but these stupid people say there's nothing. They're so\ncareless, it's a scandal.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden did not know what to say. While the clerk was looking through\nthe bundle to see if there was anything for him she came up to the desk\nagain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When does the next post come in from France?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sometimes there are letters about five.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll come then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe turned and walked rapidly away. Fritzi followed her with his tail\nbetween his legs. There was no doubt of it, already the fear had seized\nher that something was wrong. Next morning she looked dreadful; she\ncould not have closed her eyes all night; and in the middle of the\nlesson she started up from her chair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must excuse me, Herr Somerville, I cannot give you a lesson to-day.\nI am not feeling well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBefore Ashenden could say anything she had flung nervously from the\nroom, and in the evening he got a note from her to say that she\nregretted that she must discontinue giving him conversation lessons. She\ngave no reason. Then Ashenden saw no more of her; she ceased coming in\nto meals; except to go morning and afternoon to Cook's she spent\napparently the whole day in her room. Ashenden thought of her sitting\nthere hour after hour with that hideous fear gnawing at her heart. Who\ncould help feeling sorry for her? The time hung heavy on his hands too.\nHe read a good deal and wrote a little, he hired a canoe and went for\nlong leisurely paddles on the lake; and at last one morning the clerk at\nCook's handed him a letter. It was from R. It had all the appearance of\na business communication, but between the lines he read a good deal.\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <i>Dear Sir</i>, it began, <i>The goods, with accompanying letter,\n    despatched by you from Lucerne have been duly delivered. We are\n    obliged to you for executing our instructions with such\n    promptness.</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nIt went on in this strain. R. was exultant. Ashenden guessed that Caypor\nhad been arrested and by now had paid the penalty of his crime. He\nshuddered. He remembered a dreadful scene. Dawn. A cold, grey dawn, with\na drizzling rain falling. A man, blindfolded, standing against a wall,\nan officer very pale giving an order, a volley, and then a young\nsoldier, one of the firing-party, turning round and holding on to his\ngun for support, vomiting. The officer turning paler still, and he,\nAshenden, feeling dreadfully faint. How terrified Caypor must have been!\nIt was awful when the tears ran down their faces. Ashenden shook\nhimself. He went to the ticket-office and obedient to his orders bought\nhimself a ticket for Geneva.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs he was waiting for his change Mrs. Caypor came in. He was shocked at\nthe sight of her. She was blowsy and dishevelled and there were heavy\nrings round her eyes. She was deathly pale. She staggered up to the desk\nand asked for a letter. The clerk shook his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry, madam, there's nothing yet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But look, look. Are you sure? Please look again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe misery in her voice was heartrending. The clerk with a shrug of the\nshoulders took out the letters from a pigeon-hole and sorted them once\nmore.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, there's nothing, madam.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave a hoarse cry of despair and her face was distorted with\nanguish.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, God, oh, God,\" she moaned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe turned away, the tears streaming from her weary eyes, and for a\nmoment she stood there like a blind man groping and not knowing which\nway to go. Then a fearful thing happened, Fritzi, the bull-terrier, sat\ndown on his haunches and threw back his head and gave a long, long\nmelancholy howl. Mrs. Caypor looked at him with terror; her eyes seemed\nreally to start from her head. The doubt, the gnawing doubt that had\ntortured her during those dreadful days of suspense, was a doubt no\nlonger. She knew. She staggered blindly into the street.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ashenden was sent to X and looked about him he could not but see\nthat his situation was equivocal. X was the capital of an important\nbelligerent state; but a state divided against itself; there was a large\nparty antagonistic to the war and revolution was possible if not\nimminent. Ashenden was instructed to see what under the circumstances\ncould best be done; he was to suggest a policy and, if it was approved\nby the exalted personages who had sent him, to carry it out. A vast\namount of money was put at his disposal. The Ambassadors of Great\nBritain and the United States had been directed to afford him such\nfacilities as were at their command, but Ashenden had been told\nprivately to keep himself to himself; he was not to make difficulties\nfor the official representatives of the two powers by divulging to them\nfacts that it might be inconvenient for them to know; and since it might\nbe necessary for him to give support under cover to a party that was at\ndaggers drawn with that in office and with which the relations of the\nUnited States and Great Britain were extremely cordial it was just as\nwell that Ashenden should keep his own counsel. The exalted personages\ndid not wish the ambassadors to suffer the affront of discovering that\nan obscure agent had been sent to work at cross-purposes with them. On\nthe other hand it was thought just as well to have a representative in\nthe opposite camp, who in the event of a sudden upheaval would be at\nhand with adequate funds and in the confidence of the new leaders of the\ncountry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut ambassadors are sticklers for their dignity and they have a keen\nnose to scent any encroachment on their authority. When Ashenden on his\narrival at X paid an official call on Sir Herbert Witherspoon, the\nBritish Ambassador, he was received with a politeness to which no\nexception could be taken, but with a frigidity that would have sent a\nlittle shiver down the spine of a polar bear. Sir Herbert was a diplomat\n<i>de carrière</i> and he cultivated the manner of his profession to a degree\nthat filled the observer with admiration. He did not ask Ashenden\nanything about his mission because he knew that Ashenden would reply\nevasively, but he allowed him to see that it was a perfectly foolish\none. He talked with acidulous tolerance of the exalted personages who\nhad sent Ashenden to X. He told Ashenden that he had instructions to\nmeet any demands for help that he made and stated that if Ashenden at\nany time desired to see him he had only to say so.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have received the somewhat singular request to dispatch telegrams for\nyou in a private code which I understand has been given to you and to\nhand over to you telegrams in code as they arrive.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope they will be few and far between, sir,\" answered Ashenden. \"I\nknow nothing so tedious as coding and decoding.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSir Herbert paused for an instant. Perhaps that was not quite the answer\nhe expected. He rose.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you will come into the Chancellery I will introduce you to the\nCounsellor and to the Secretary to whom you can take your telegrams.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden followed him out of the room, and after handing him over to the\nCounsellor the ambassador gave him a limp hand to shake.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again one of these\ndays,\" he said, and with a curt nod left him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden bore his reception with composure. It was his business to\nremain in obscurity and he did not wish any official attentions to\nattract notice to him. But when on the afternoon of the same day he made\nhis call at the American Embassy he discovered why Sir Herbert\nWitherspoon had shown him so much coldness. The American ambassador was\nMr. Wilbur Schäfer; he came from Kansas City and had been given his post\nwhen few suspected that a war was on the point of breaking out, as a\nreward for political services. He was a big stout man, no longer young,\nfor his hair was white, but well-preserved and exceedingly robust. He\nhad a square, red face, clean-shaven, with a little snub nose and a\ndetermined chin. His face was very mobile and he twisted it continually\ninto odd and amusing grimaces. It looked as though it were made out of\nthe red india-rubber from which they make hot-water bottles. He greeted\nAshenden with cordiality. He was a hearty fellow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you've seen Sir Herbert. I reckon you've got his dander up.\nWhat do they mean in Washington and London by telling us to dispatch\nyour code telegrams without knowing what they're all about? You know,\nthey've got no right to do that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Your Excellency, I think it was only done to save time and\ntrouble,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what is this mission anyway?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis of course was a question that Ashenden was not prepared to answer,\nbut not thinking it politic to say so, he determined to give a reply\nfrom which the ambassador could learn little. He had already made up his\nmind from the look of him that Mr. Schäfer, though doubtless possessed\nof the gifts that enable a man to swing a presidential election this way\nor that, had not, at least nakedly for all men to see, the acuteness\nthat his position perhaps demanded. He gave you the impression of a\nbluff, good-humoured creature who liked good cheer. Ashenden would have\nbeen wary when playing poker with him, but where the matter in hand was\nconcerned felt himself fairly safe. He began to talk in a loose, vague\nway of the world at large and before he had gone far managed to ask the\nambassador his opinion of the general situation. It was as the sound of\nthe trumpet to the war-horse: Mr. Schäfer made him a speech that lasted\nwithout a break for twenty-five minutes, and when at last he stopped in\nexhaustion, Ashenden with warm thanks for his friendly reception was\nable to take his leave.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMaking up his mind to give both the ambassadors a wide berth, he set\nabout his work and presently devised a plan of campaign. But by chance\nhe was able to do Sir Herbert Witherspoon a good turn and so was thrown\nagain into contact with him. It has been suggested that Mr. Schäfer was\nmore of a politician than a diplomat, and it was his position rather\nthan his personality that gave weight to his opinions. He looked upon\nthe eminence to which he had risen as an opportunity to enjoy the good\nthings of life and his enthusiasm led him to lengths that his\nconstitution could ill support. His ignorance of foreign affairs would\nin any case have made his judgment of doubtful value, but his state at\nmeetings of the Allied ambassadors so often approached the comatose that\nhe seemed hardly capable of forming a judgment at all. He was known to\nhave succumbed to the fascination of a Swedish lady of undoubted beauty,\nbut of antecedents that from the point of view of a secret service agent\nwere suspect. Her relations with Germany were such as to make her\nsympathy with the Allies dubious. Mr. Schäfer saw her every day and was\ncertainly much under her influence. Now it was noticed that there was\nfrom time to time a leakage of very secret information and the question\narose whether Mr. Schäfer did not in these daily interviews\ninadvertently say things that were promptly passed on to the\nheadquarters of the enemy. No one could have doubted Mr. Schäfer's\nhonesty and patriotism, but it was permissible to be uncertain of his\ndiscretion. It was an awkward matter to deal with, but the concern was\nas great in Washington as in London and Paris, and Ashenden was\ninstructed to deal with it. He had of course not been sent to X without\nhelp to do the work he was expected to do, and among his assistants was\nan astute, powerful and determined man, a Galician Pole, named\nHerbartus. After consultation with him it happened by one of those\nfortunate coincidences that occasionally come about in the secret\nservice that a maid in the service of the Swedish lady fell ill and in\nher place the countess (for such she was) was very luckily able to\nengage an extremely respectable person from the neighbourhood of Cracow.\nThe fact that before the war she had been secretary to an eminent\nscientist made her doubtless no less competent a housemaid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe result of this was that Ashenden received every two or three days a\nneat report upon the goings-on at this charming lady's apartment, and\nthough he learned nothing that could confirm the vague suspicions that\nhad arisen he learned something else of no little importance. From\nconversations held at the cosy little <i>tête-à-tête</i> dinners that the\ncountess gave the ambassador it appeared that His Excellency was\nharbouring a bitter grievance against his English colleague. He\ncomplained that the relations between himself and Sir Herbert were\ndeliberately maintained on a purely official level. In his blunt way he\nsaid he was sick of the frills that damned Britisher put on. He was a\nhe-man and a hundred-per-cent American and he had no more use for\nprotocol and etiquette than for a snowball in hell. Why didn't they get\ntogether, like a couple of regular fellows, and have a good old crack?\nBlood was thicker than water, he'd say, and they'd do more towards\nwinning the war by sitting down in their shirt-sleeves and talking\nthings out over a bottle of rye than by all their diplomacy and white\nspats. Now it was obviously very undesirable that there should not exist\nbetween the two ambassadors a perfect cordiality, so Ashenden thought it\nwell to ask Sir Herbert whether he might see him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was ushered into Sir Herbert's library.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Mr. Ashenden, what can I do for you? I hope you're quite\nsatisfied with everything. I understand that you've been keeping the\ntelegraph lines busy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden, as he sat down, gave the ambassador a glance. He was\nbeautifully dressed in a perfectly cut tail-coat that fitted his slim\nfigure like a glove, in his black silk tie was a handsome pearl, there\nwas a perfect line in his grey trousers, with their quiet and\ndistinguished stripe, and his neat, pointed shoes looked as though he\nhad never worn them before. You could hardly imagine him sitting in his\nshirt-sleeves over a whisky high-ball. He was a tall, thin man, with\nexactly the figure to show off modern clothes, and he sat in his chair,\nrather upright, as though he were sitting for an official portrait. In\nhis cold and uninteresting way he was really a very handsome fellow. His\nneat grey hair was parted on one side, his pale face was clean-shaven,\nhe had a delicate, straight nose and grey eyes under grey eyebrows, his\nmouth in youth might have been sensual and well-shaped, but now it was\nset to an expression of sarcastic determination and the lips were\npallid. It was the kind of face that suggested centuries of good\nbreeding, but you could not believe it capable of expressing emotion.\nYou would never expect to see it break into the hearty distortion of\nlaughter, but at the most be for a moment frigidly kindled by an ironic\nsmile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was uncommonly nervous.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid you'll think I'm meddling in what doesn't concern me, sir.\nI'm quite prepared to be told to mind my own business.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'll see. Pray go on.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden told his story and the ambassador listened attentively. He did\nnot turn his cold, grey eyes from Ashenden's face, and Ashenden knew\nthat his embarrassment was obvious.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did you find out all this?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have means of getting hold of little bits of information that are\nsometimes useful,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSir Herbert maintained his steady gaze, but Ashenden was surprised to\nsee on a sudden in the steely eyes a little smile. The bleak,\nsupercilious face became for an instant quite attractive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is another little bit of information that perhaps you'd be good\nenough to give me. What does one do to be a regular fellow?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am afraid one can do nothing, Your Excellency,\" replied Ashenden\ngravely. \"I think it is a gift of God.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe light vanished from Sir Herbert's eyes, but his manner was slightly\nmore urbane than when Ashenden was brought into the room. He rose and\nheld out his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You did quite right to come and tell me this, Mr. Ashenden. I have been\nvery remiss. It is inexcusable on my part to offend that inoffensive old\ngentleman. But I will do my best to repair my error. I will call at the\nAmerican Embassy this afternoon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But not in too great state, sir, if I may venture a suggestion.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe ambassador's eyes twinkled. Ashenden began to think him almost\nhuman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can do nothing but in state, Mr. Ashenden. That is one of the\nmisfortunes of my temperament.\" Then as Ashenden was leaving he added:\n\"Oh, by the way, I wonder if you'd care to come to dinner with me\nto-morrow night. Black tie. At eight-fifteen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not wait for Ashenden's assent, but took it for granted, and with\na nod of dismissal sat down once more at his great writing-table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden looked forward with misgiving to the dinner to which Sir\nHerbert Witherspoon had invited him. The black tie suggested a small\nparty, perhaps only Lady Anne, the ambassador's wife, whom Ashenden did\nnot know, or one or two young secretaries. It did not presage a\nhilarious evening. It was possible that they might play bridge after\ndinner, but Ashenden knew that professional diplomats do not play bridge\nwith skill: it may be supposed that they find it difficult to bend their\ngreat minds to the triviality of a parlour game. On the other hand he\nwas interested to see a little more of the ambassador in circumstances\nof less formality. For it was evident that Sir Herbert Witherspoon was\nnot an ordinary person. He was in appearance and manner a perfect\nspecimen of his class and it is always entertaining to come upon good\nexamples of a well-known type. He was exactly what you expected an\nambassador to be. If any of his characteristics had been ever so\nslightly exaggerated he would have been a caricature. He escaped being\nridiculous only by a hair's breadth and you watched him with a kind of\nbreathlessness as you might watch a tight-rope dancer doing perilous\nfeats at a dizzy height. He was certainly a man of character. His rise\nin the diplomatic service had been rapid and though doubtless it helped\nhim to be connected by marriage with powerful families his rise had been\ndue chiefly to his merit. He knew how to be determined when\ndetermination was necessary and conciliatory when conciliation was\nopportune. His manners were perfect; he could speak half a dozen\nlanguages with ease and accuracy; he had a clear and logical brain. He\nwas never afraid to think out his thoughts to the end, but was wise\nenough to suit his actions to the exigencies of the situation. He had\nreached his post at X at the early age of fifty-three and had borne\nhimself in the exceedingly difficult conditions created by the war and\ncontending parties within the state with tact, confidence and once at\nleast with courage. For on one occasion, a riot having arisen, a band of\nrevolutionaries forced their way into the British Embassy and Sir\nHerbert from the head of his stairs had harangued them and\nnotwithstanding revolvers flourished at him had persuaded them to go to\ntheir homes. He would end his career in Paris. That was evident. He was\na man whom you could not but admire but whom it was not easy to like. He\nwas a diplomat of the school of those Victorian ambassadors to whom\ncould confidently be entrusted great affairs and whose self-reliance,\nsometimes it must be admitted tinctured with arrogance, was justified by\nits results.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ashenden drove up to the doors of the Embassy they were flung open\nand he was received by a stout and dignified English butler and three\nfootmen. He was ushered up that magnificent flight of stairs on which\nhad taken place the dramatic incident just related and shown into an\nimmense room, dimly lit with shaded lamps, in which at the first glance\nhe caught sight of large pieces of stately furniture and over the\nchimney-piece an immense portrait in coronation robes of King George IV.\nBut there was a bright fire blazing on the hearth and from a deep sofa\nby the side of it his host, as his name was announced, slowly rose. Sir\nHerbert looked very elegant as he came towards him. He wore his dinner\njacket, the most difficult costume for a man to look well in, with\nnotable distinction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My wife has gone to a concert, but she'll come in later. She wants to\nmake your acquaintance. I haven't asked anybody else. I thought I would\ngive myself the pleasure of enjoying your company <i>en tête-à-tête</i>.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden murmured a civil rejoinder, but his heart sank. He wondered how\nhe was going to pass at least a couple of hours alone with this man who\nmade him, he was bound to confess, feel extremely shy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe door was opened again and the butler and a footman entered bearing\nvery heavy silver salvers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I always have a glass of sherry before my dinner,\" said the ambassador,\n\"but in case you have acquired the barbarous custom of drinking\ncocktails I can offer you what I believe is called a dry Martini.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShy though he might be, Ashenden was not going to give in to this sort\nof thing with complete tameness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I move with the times,\" he replied. \"To drink a glass of sherry when\nyou can get a dry Martini is like taking a stage-coach when you can\ntravel by the Orient Express.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA little desultory conversation after this fashion was interrupted by\nthe throwing open of two great doors and the announcement that His\nExcellency's dinner was served. They went into the dining-room. This was\na vast apartment in which sixty people might have comfortably dined, but\nthere was now only a small round table in it so that Sir Herbert and\nAshenden sat intimately. There was an immense mahogany sideboard on\nwhich were massive pieces of gold plate, and above it, facing Ashenden,\nwas a fine picture by Canaletto. Over the chimney-piece was a\nthree-quarter-length portrait of Queen Victoria as a girl with a little\ngold crown on her small, prim head. Dinner was served by the corpulent\nbutler and the three very tall English footmen. Ashenden had the\nimpression that the ambassador enjoyed in his well-bred way the\nsensation of ignoring the pomp in which he lived. They might have been\ndining in one of the great country houses of England; it was a ceremony\nthey performed, sumptuous without ostentation, and it was saved from a\ntrifling absurdity only because it was in a tradition; but the\nexperience gained for Ashenden a kind of savour from the thought that\ndwelt with him that on the other side of the wall was a restless,\nturbulent population that might at any moment break into bloody\nrevolution, while not two hundred miles away men in the trenches were\nsheltering in their dug-outs from the bitter cold and the pitiless\nbombardment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden need not have feared that the conversation would proceed with\ndifficulty and the notion he had had that Sir Herbert had asked him in\norder to question him about his secret mission was quickly dispelled.\nThe ambassador behaved to him as though he were a travelling Englishman\nwho had presented a letter of introduction and to whom he desired to\nshow civility. You would hardly have thought that a war was raging, for\nhe made to it only such references as showed that he was not\ndeliberately avoiding a distressing subject. He spoke of art and\nliterature, proving himself to be a diligent reader of catholic taste,\nand when Ashenden talked to him, from personal acquaintance, of the\nwriters whom Sir Herbert knew only through their works, he listened with\nthe friendly condescension which the great ones of the earth affect\ntowards the artist. (Sometimes, however, they paint a picture or write a\nbook, and then the artist gets a little of his own back.) He mentioned\nin passing a character in one of Ashenden's novels, but did not make any\nother reference to the fact that his guest was a writer. Ashenden\nadmired his urbanity. He disliked people to talk to him of his books, in\nwhich indeed, once written, he took small interest, and it made him\nself-conscious to be praised or blamed to his face. Sir Herbert\nWitherspoon flattered his self-esteem by showing that he had read him,\nbut spared his delicacy by withholding his opinion of what he had read.\nHe spoke too of the various countries in which during his career he had\nbeen stationed and of various persons, in London and elsewhere, that he\nand Ashenden knew in common. He talked well, not without a pleasant\nirony that might very well have passed for humour, and intelligently.\nAshenden did not find his dinner dull, but neither did he find it\nexhilarating. He would have been more interested if the ambassador had\nnot so invariably said the right, wise and sensible thing upon every\ntopic that was introduced. Ashenden was finding it something of an\neffort to keep up with this distinction of mind and he would have liked\nthe conversation to get into its shirt-sleeves, so to speak, and put its\nfeet on the table. But of this there was no chance and Ashenden once or\ntwice caught himself wondering how soon after dinner he could decently\ntake his leave. At eleven he had an appointment with Herbartus at the\nHotel de Paris.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe dinner came to an end and coffee was brought in. Sir Herbert knew\ngood food and good wine and Ashenden was obliged to admit that he had\nfared excellently. Liqueurs were served with the coffee, and Ashenden\ntook a glass of brandy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have some very old Benedictine,\" said the ambassador. \"Won't you try\nit?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To tell you the honest truth I think brandy is the only liqueur worth\ndrinking.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not sure that I don't agree with you. But in that case I must give\nyou something better than that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave an order to the butler, who presently brought in a cobwebbed\nbottle and two enormous glasses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't really want to boast,\" said the ambassador as he watched the\nbutler pour the golden liquid into Ashenden's glass, \"but I venture to\nthink that if you like brandy you'll like this. I got it when I was\ncounsellor for a short time in Paris.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've had a good deal to do lately with one of your successors then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Byring?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you think of the brandy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think it's marvellous.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And of Byring?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe question came so oddly on the top of the other that it sounded\nfaintly comic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I think he's a damned fool.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSir Herbert leaned back in his chair, holding the huge glass with both\nhands in order to bring out the aroma, and looked slowly round the\nstately and spacious room. The table had been cleared of superfluous\nthings. There was a bowl of roses between Ashenden and his host. The\nservants switched off the electric light as they finally left the room\nand it was lit now only by the candles that were on the table and by the\nfire. Notwithstanding its size it had an air of sober comfort. The\nambassador's eyes rested on the really distinguished portrait of Queen\nVictoria that hung over the chimney-piece.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder,\" he said at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He'll have to leave the diplomatic service.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid so.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden gave him a quick glance of enquiry. He was the last man from\nwhom he would have expected sympathy for Byring.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, in the circumstances,\" he proceeded, \"I suppose it's inevitable\nthat he should leave the service. I'm sorry. He's an able fellow and\nhe'll be missed. I think he had a career before him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, that is what I've heard. I'm told that at the F.O. they thought\nvery highly of him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He has many of the gifts that are useful in this rather dreary trade,\"\nsaid the ambassador, with a slight smile, in his cold and judicial\nmanner. \"He's handsome, he's a gentleman, he has nice manners, he speaks\nexcellent French and he has a good head on his shoulders. He'd have done\nwell.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It seems a pity that he should waste such golden opportunities.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I understand he's going into the wine business at the end of the war.\nOddly enough he's going to represent the very firm from whom I got this\nbrandy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSir Herbert raised the glass to his nose and inhaled the fragrance. Then\nhe looked at Ashenden. He had a way of looking at people, when he was\nthinking of something else perhaps, that suggested that he thought them\nsomewhat peculiar but rather disgusting insects.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you ever seen the woman?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dined with her and Byring at Larue's.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How very interesting. What is she like?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Charming.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden tried to describe her to his host, but meanwhile with another\npart of his mind he recollected the impression she had made on him at\nthe restaurant when Byring had introduced him to her. He had been not a\nlittle interested to meet a woman of whom for some years he had heard so\nmuch. She called herself Rose Auburn, but what her real name was few\nknew. She had gone to Paris originally as one of a troupe of dancers,\ncalled the Glad Girls, who performed at the Moulin Rouge, but her\nastonishing beauty had soon caused her to be noticed and a wealthy\nFrench manufacturer fell in love with her. He gave her a house and\nloaded her with jewels, but could not long meet the demands she made\nupon him, and she passed in rapid succession from lover to lover. She\nbecame in a short time the best known courtesan in France. Her\nexpenditure was prodigal and she ruined her admirers with cynical\nunconcern. The richest men found themselves unable to cope with her\nextravagance. Ashenden, before the war, had seen her once at Monte Carlo\nlose a hundred and eighty thousand francs at a sitting and that then was\nan important sum. She sat at the big table, surrounded by curious\nonlookers, throwing down packets of thousand-franc notes with a\nself-possession that would have been admirable if it had been her own\nmoney that she was losing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ashenden met her she had been leading this riotous life, dancing\nand gambling all night, racing most afternoons a week, for twelve or\nthirteen years and she was no longer very young; but there was hardly a\nline on that lovely brow, scarcely a crowsfoot round those liquid eyes,\nto betray the fact. The most astonishing thing about her was that\nnotwithstanding this feverish and unending round of senseless debauchery\nshe had preserved an air of virginity. Of course she cultivated the\ntype. She had an exquisitely graceful and slender figure, and her\ninnumerable frocks were always made with a perfect simplicity. Her brown\nhair was very plainly done. With her oval face, charming little nose and\nlarge blue eyes she had all the air of one or other of Anthony\nTrollope's charming heroines. It was the keepsake style raised to such\nrareness that it made you catch your breath. She had a lovely skin, very\nwhite and red, and if she painted it was not from necessity but from\nwantonness. She irradiated a sort of dewy innocence that was as\nattractive as it was unexpected.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden had heard of course that Byring for a year or more had been her\nlover. Her notoriety was such that a hard light of publicity was shed on\neveryone with whom she had any affair, but in this instance the gossips\nhad more to say than usual because Byring had no money to speak of and\nRose Auburn had never been known to grant her favours for anything that\ndid not in some way represent hard cash. Was it possible that she loved\nhim? It seemed incredible and yet what other explanation was there?\nByring was a young man with whom any woman might have fallen in love. He\nwas somewhere in the thirties, very tall and good-looking with a\nsingular charm of manner and of an appearance so debonair that people\nturned round in the street to look at him; but unlike most handsome men\nhe seemed entirely unaware of the impression he created. When it became\nknown that Byring was the <i>amant de coeur</i> (a prettier phrase than our\nEnglish fancy man) of this famous harlot he became an object of\nadmiration to many women and of envy to many men; but when a rumour\nspread abroad that he was going to marry her consternation seized his\nfriends and ribald laughter everyone else. It became known that Byring's\nchief had asked him if it was true and he had admitted it. Pressure was\nput upon him to relinquish a plan that could only end in disaster. It\nwas pointed out to him that the wife of a diplomat has social\nobligations that Rose Auburn could not fulfil. Byring replied that he\nwas prepared to resign his post whenever by so doing he would not cause\ninconvenience. He brushed aside every expostulation and every argument;\nhe was determined to marry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen first Ashenden met Byring he did not very much take to him. He\nfound him slightly aloof. But as the hazards of his work brought him\nfrom time to time into contact with him he discerned that the distant\nmanner was due merely to shyness and as he came to know him better he\nwas charmed by the uncommon sweetness of his disposition. Their\nrelations, however, remained purely official so that it was a trifle\nunexpected when Byring one day asked him to dinner to meet Miss Auburn,\nand he could not but wonder whether it was because already people were\nbeginning to turn the cold shoulder on him. When he went he discovered\nthat the invitation was due to the lady's curiosity. But the surprise he\ngot on learning that she had found time to read (with admiration, it\nappeared) two or three of his novels was not the only surprise he got\nthat evening. Leading on the whole a quiet and studious life he had\nnever had occasion to penetrate into the world of the higher\nprostitution and the great courtesans of the period were known to him\nonly by name. It was somewhat astonishing to Ashenden to discover that\nRose Auburn differed so little in air and manner from the smart women of\nMayfair with whom through his books he had become more or less\nintimately acquainted. She was perhaps a little more anxious to please\n(indeed one of her agreeable traits was the interest she took in\nwhomever she was talking to), but she was certainly no more made-up and\nher conversation was as intelligent. It lacked only the coarseness that\nsociety has lately affected. Perhaps she felt instinctively that those\nlovely lips should never disfigure themselves with foul words; perhaps\nonly she was at heart still a trifle suburban. It was evident that she\nand Byring were madly in love with one another. It was really moving to\nsee their mutual passion. When Ashenden took his leave of them, as he\nshook hands with her (and she held his hand a moment and with her blue,\nstarry eyes looked into his) she said to him:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You will come and see us when we're settled in London, won't you? You\nknow we're going to be married.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I heartily congratulate you,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And him?\" she smiled, and her smile was like an angel's; it had the\nfreshness of dawn and the tender rapture of a southern spring.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you never looked at yourself in the glass?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSir Herbert Witherspoon watched him intently while Ashenden (he thought\nnot without a trace of humour) was describing the dinner-party. No\nflicker of a smile brightened his cold eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think it'll be a success?\" he asked now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why not?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe question took Ashenden aback.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A man not only marries his wife, he marries her friends. Do you realise\nthe sort of people Byring will have to mix with, painted women of\ntarnished reputation and men who've gone down in the social scale,\nparasites and adventurers? Of course they'll have money, her pearls must\nbe worth a hundred thousand pounds, and they'll be able to cut a dash in\nthe smart Bohemia of London. Do you know the gold fringe of society?\nWhen a woman of bad character marries she earns the admiration of her\nset, she has worked the trick, she's caught a man and become\nrespectable, but he, the man, only earns its ridicule. Even her own\nfriends, the old hags with their gigolos and the abject men who earn a\nshabby living by introducing the unwary to tradesmen on a ten per cent\ncommission, even they despise him. He is the mug. Believe me, to conduct\nyourself gracefully in such a position you need either great dignity of\ncharacter or an unparalleled effrontery. Besides, do you think there's a\nchance of its lasting? Can a woman who's led that wild career settle\ndown to domestic life? In a little while she'll grow bored and restless.\nAnd how long does love last? Don't you think Byring's reflections will\nbe bitter when, caring for her no longer, he compares what he is with\nwhat he might have been?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWitherspoon helped himself to another drop of his old brandy. Then he\nlooked up at Ashenden with a curious expression.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not sure if a man isn't wiser to do what he wants very much to do\nand let the consequences take care of themselves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must be very pleasant to be an ambassador,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSir Herbert smiled thinly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Byring rather reminds me of a fellow I knew when I was a very junior\nclerk at the F.O. I won't tell you his name because he's by way of being\nvery well-known now and highly respected. He's made a great success of\nhis career. There is always something a little absurd in success.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden slightly raised his eyebrows at this statement, somewhat\nunexpected in the mouth of Sir Herbert Witherspoon, but did not say\nanything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was one of my fellow-clerks. He was a brilliant creature, I don't\nthink anyone ever denied that, and everyone prophesied from the\nbeginning that he would go far. I venture to say that he had pretty well\nall the qualifications necessary for a diplomatic career. He was of a\nfamily of soldiers and sailors, nothing very grand, but eminently\nrespectable, and he knew how to behave in the great world without\nbumptiousness or timidity. He was well-read. He took an interest in\npainting. I dare say he made himself a trifle ridiculous; he wanted to\nbe in the movement, he was very anxious to be modern, and at a time when\nlittle was known of Gauguin and Cézanne he raved over their pictures.\nThere was perhaps a certain snobbishness in his attitude, a desire to\nshock and astonish the conventional, but at heart his admiration of the\narts was genuine and sincere. He adored Paris and whenever he had the\nchance ran over and put up at a little hotel in the Latin Quarter, where\nhe could rub shoulders with painters and writers. As is the habit with\ngentry of that sort they patronised him a little because he was nothing\nbut a diplomat and laughed at him a little because he was evidently a\ngentleman. But they liked him because he was always ready to listen to\ntheir speeches, and when he praised their works they were even willing\nto admit that, though a philistine, he had a certain instinct for the\nRight Stuff.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden noted the sarcasm and smiled at the fling at his own\nprofession. He wondered what this long description was leading to. The\nambassador seemed to linger over it partly because he liked it, but also\nbecause for some reason he hesitated to come to the point.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But my friend was modest. He enjoyed himself enormously and he listened\nopen-mouthed when these young painters and unknown scribblers tore to\npieces established reputations and talked with enthusiasm of persons of\nwhom the sober but cultured secretaries in Downing Street had never even\nheard. At the back of his mind he knew that they were rather a common,\nsecond-rate lot, and when he went back to his work in London it was with\nno regret, but with the feeling that he had been witnessing an odd and\ndiverting play; now the curtain had fallen he was quite ready to go\nhome. I haven't told you that he was ambitious. He knew that his friends\nexpected him to do considerable things and he had no notion of\ndisappointing them. He was perfectly conscious of his abilities. He\nmeant to succeed. Unfortunately he was not rich, he had only a few\nhundreds a year, but his father and mother were dead and he had neither\nbrother nor sister. He was aware that this freedom from close ties was\nan asset. His opportunity to make connections that would be of use to\nhim was unrestricted. Do you think he sounds a very disagreeable young\nman?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No,\" said Ashenden in answer to the sudden question. \"Most clever young\nmen are aware of their cleverness, and there is generally a certain\ncynicism in their calculations with regard to the future. Surely young\nmen should be ambitious.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, on one of these little trips to Paris my friend became acquainted\nwith a talented young Irish painter called O'Malley. He's an R.A. now\nand paints highly paid portraits of Lord Chancellors and Cabinet\nMinisters. I wonder if you remember one he did of my wife, which was\nexhibited a couple of years ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I don't. But I know his name.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My wife was delighted with it. His art always seems to me very refined\nand agreeable. He's able to put on canvas the distinction of his sitters\nin a very remarkable way. When he paints a woman of breeding, you know\nthat it is a woman of breeding and not a trollop.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is a charming gift,\" said Ashenden. \"Can he also paint a slut and\nmake her look like one?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He could. Now doubtless he would scarcely wish to. He was living then\nin a small and dirty studio in the rue du Cherche Midi with a little\nFrenchwoman of the character you describe and he painted several\nportraits of her which were extremely like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt seemed to Ashenden that Sir Herbert was going into somewhat excessive\ndetail, and he asked himself whether the friend of whom he was telling a\nstory that till now seemed to lead no-whither was in point of fact\nhimself. He began to give it more of his attention.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My friend liked O'Malley. He was good company, the type of the\nagreeable rattle, and he had a truly Irish gift of the gab. He talked\nincessantly and in my friend's opinion brilliantly. He found it very\namusing to go and sit in the studio while O'Malley was painting and\nlisten to him chattering away about the technique of his art. O'Malley\nwas always saying that he would paint a portrait of him and his vanity\nwas tickled. O'Malley thought him far from plain and said it would do\nhim good to exhibit the portrait of someone who at least looked like a\ngentleman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, when was all this?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, thirty years ago.... They used to talk of their future and when\nO'Malley said the portrait he was going to paint of my friend would look\nvery well in the National Portrait Gallery, my friend had small doubt in\nthe back of his mind, whatever he modestly said, that it would\neventually find its way there. One evening when my friend--shall we call\nhim Brown?--was sitting in the studio and O'Malley, desperately taking\nadvantage of the last light of day, was trying to get finished for the\nSalon that portrait of his mistress which is now in the Tate Gallery,\nO'Malley asked him if he would like to come and dine with them. He was\nexpecting a friend of hers, she was called Yvonne by the way, and he\nwould be glad if Brown would make a fourth. This friend of Yvonne's was\nan acrobat and O'Malley was anxious to get her to pose for him in the\nnude. Yvonne said she had a marvellous figure. She had seen O'Malley's\nwork and was willing enough to sit and dinner was to be devoted to\nsettling the matter. She was not performing then, but was about to open\nat the Gaîtés Montparnasses and with her days free was not disinclined\nto oblige a friend and earn a little money. The notion amused Brown, who\nhad never met an acrobat, and he accepted. Yvonne suggested that he\nmight find her to his taste and if he did she could promise him that he\nwould not find her very difficult to persuade. With his grand air and\nEnglish clothes she would take him for a <i>milord anglais</i>. My friend\nlaughed. He did not take the suggestion very seriously. '<i>On ne sait\njamais</i>,' he said. Yvonne looked at him with mischievous eyes. He sat\non. It was Easter time and cold, but the studio was comfortably warm,\nand though it was small and everything was higgledy-piggledy and the\ndust lay heavy on the rim of the window, it was most friendly and cosy.\nBrown had a tiny flat in Waverton Street, in London, with very good\nmezzotints on the walls and several pieces of early Chinese pottery here\nand there, and he wondered to himself why his tasteful sitting-room had\nnone of the comforts of home nor the romance that he found in that\ndisorderly studio.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Presently there was a ring at the door and Yvonne ushered in her\nfriend. Her name, it appeared, was Alix, and she shook hands with Brown,\nuttering a stereotyped phrase, with the mincing politeness of a fat\nwoman in a <i>bureau de tabac</i>. She wore a long cloak in imitation mink\nand an enormous scarlet hat. She looked incredibly vulgar. She was not\neven pretty. She had a broad flat face, a wide mouth and an upturned\nnose. She had a great deal of hair, golden, but obviously dyed, and\nlarge china-blue eyes. She was heavily made-up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden began to have no doubt that Witherspoon was narrating an\nexperience of his own, for otherwise he could never have remembered\nafter thirty years what hat the young woman wore and what coat, and he\nwas amused at the ambassador's simplicity in thinking that so thin a\nsubterfuge could disguise the truth. Ashenden could not but guess how\nthe story would end and it tickled him to think that this cold,\ndistinguished and exquisite person should ever have had anything like an\nadventure.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She began to talk away to Yvonne and my friend noticed that she had one\nfeature that oddly enough he found very attractive: she had a deep and\nhusky voice as though she were just recovering from a bad cold and, he\ndidn't know why, it seemed to him exceedingly pleasant to listen to. He\nasked O'Malley if that was her natural voice and O'Malley said she had\nhad it as long as ever he had known her. He called it a whisky voice. He\ntold her what Brown said about it and she gave him a smile of her wide\nmouth and said it wasn't due to drink, it was due to standing so much on\nher head. That was one of the inconveniences of her profession. Then the\nfour of them went to a beastly little restaurant off the boulevard St.\nMichel where for two francs fifty including wine my friend ate a dinner\nthat seemed to him more delicious than any he had ever eaten at the\nSavoy or Claridge's. Alix was a very chatty young person and Brown\nlistened with amusement, with amazement even, while in her rich, throaty\nvoice she talked of the varied incidents of the day. She had a great\ncommand of slang and though he could not understand half of it, he was\nimmensely tickled with its picturesque vulgarity. It was pungent of the\nheated asphalt, the zinc bars of cheap taverns and racy of the crowded\nsquares in the poorer districts of Paris. There was an energy in those\napt and vivid metaphors that went like champagne to his anæmic head. She\nwas a guttersnipe, yes, that's what she was, but she had a vitality that\nwarmed you like a blazing fire. He was conscious that Yvonne had told\nher that he was an unattached Englishman, with plenty of money; he saw\nthe appraising glance she gave him and then, pretending that he had\nnoticed nothing, he caught the phrase, <i>il n'est pas mal</i>. It faintly\namused him: he had a notion himself that he was not so bad. There were\nplaces, indeed, where they went further than that. She did not pay much\nattention to him, in point of fact they were talking of things of which\nhe was ignorant and he could do little more than show an intelligent\ninterest, but now and again she gave him a long look, passing her tongue\nquickly round her lips, that suggested to him that he only had to ask\nfor her to give. He shrugged a mental shoulder. She looked healthy and\nyoung, she had an agreeable vivacity, but beyond her husky voice there\nwas nothing particularly attractive in her. But the notion of having a\nlittle affair in Paris did not displease him, it was life, and the\nthought that she was a music-hall artiste was mildly diverting: in\nmiddle age it would doubtless amuse him to remember that he had enjoyed\nthe favours of an acrobat. Was it la Rochefoucauld or Oscar Wilde who\nsaid that you should commit errors in youth in order to have something\nto regret in old age? At the end of dinner (and they sat over their\ncoffee and brandy till late), they went out into the street and Yvonne\nproposed that he should take Alix home. He said he would be delighted.\nAlix said it was not far and they walked. She told him that she had a\nlittle apartment, of course mostly she was on tour, but she liked to\nhave a place of her own, a woman, you know, had to be in her furniture,\nwithout that she received no consideration; and presently they reached a\nshabby house in a bedraggled street. She rang the bell for the\n<i>concierge</i> to open the door. She did not press him to enter. He did not\nknow if she looked upon it as a matter of course. He was seized with\ntimidity. He racked his brains, but could not think of a single thing to\nsay. Silence fell upon them. It was absurd. With a little click the door\nopened; she looked at him expectantly; she was puzzled; a wave of\nshyness swept over him. Then she held out her hand, thanked him for\nbringing her to the door, and bade him good-night. His heart beat\nnervously. If she had asked him to come in he would have gone. He wanted\nsome sign that she would like him to. He shook her hand, said\ngood-night, raised his hat and walked away. He felt a perfect fool. He\ncould not sleep; he tossed from side to side of his bed, thinking for\nwhat a noodle she must take him, and he could hardly wait for the day\nthat would permit him to take steps to efface the contemptible\nimpression he must have made on her. His pride was lacerated. Wanting to\nlose no time he went round to her house at eleven to ask her to lunch\nwith him, but she was out; he sent round some flowers and later in the\nday called again. She had been in, but was gone out once more. He went\nto see O'Malley on the chance of finding her, but she was not there, and\nO'Malley facetiously asked him how he had fared. To save his face he\ntold him that he had come to the conclusion that she did not mean very\nmuch to him and so like a perfect gentleman he had left her. But he had\nan uneasy feeling that O'Malley saw through his story. He sent her a\n<i>pneumatique</i> asking her to dine with him next day. She did not answer.\nHe could not understand it, he asked the porter of his hotel a dozen\ntimes if there was nothing for him, and at last, almost in desperation,\njust before dinner went to her house. The <i>concierge</i> told him she was\nin and he went up. He was very nervous, inclined to be angry because she\nhad treated his invitation so cavalierly, but at the same time anxious\nto appear at his ease. He climbed the four flights of stairs, dark and\nsmelly, and rang at the door to which he had been directed. There was a\npause, he heard sounds within and rang again. Presently she opened. He\nhad an absolute certitude that she did not in the least know who he was.\nHe was taken aback, it was a blow to his vanity; but he assumed a\ncheerful smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I came to find out if you were going to dine with me to-night. I sent\nyou a <i>pneumatique</i>.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then she recognised him. But she stood at the door and did not ask him\nin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, no, I can't dine with you to-night. I have terrible megrim and I\nam going to bed. I couldn't answer your <i>pneumatique</i>, I mislaid it, and\nI'd forgotten your name. Thank you for the flowers. It was nice of you\nto send them.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Then won't you come and dine with me to-morrow night?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'<i>Justement</i>, I have an engagement to-morrow night. I'm sorry.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There was nothing more to say. He had not the nerve to ask her anything\nelse and so bade her good-night and went. He had the impression that she\nwas not vexed with him, but that she had entirely forgotten him. It was\nhumiliating. When he went back to London without having seen her again,\nit was with a curious sense of dissatisfaction. He was not in the least\nin love with her, he was annoyed with her, but he could not get her\nquite out of his mind. He was honest enough to realise that he was\nsuffering from nothing more than wounded vanity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"During that dinner at the little restaurant off the Boul' Mich' she had\nmentioned that her troupe was going to London in the spring and in one\nof his letters to O'Malley he slipped in casually a phrase to the effect\nthat if his young friend Alix happened to be coming to town he\n(O'Malley) might let him know and he would look her up. He would like to\nhear from her own ingenuous lips what she thought of the nude O'Malley\nhad painted of her. When the painter some time afterwards wrote and told\nhim that she was appearing a week later at the Metropolitan in the\nEdgware Road, he felt a sudden rush of blood to his head. He went to see\nher play. If he had not taken the precaution to go earlier in the day\nand look at the programme he would have missed her, for her turn was the\nfirst on the list. There were two men, a stout one and a thin one, with\nlarge black moustaches, and Alix. They were dressed in ill-fitting pink\ntights with green satin trunks. The men did various exercises on twin\ntrapezes while Alix tripped about the stage, giving them handkerchiefs\nto wipe their hands on, and occasionally turned a somersault. When the\nfat man raised the thin one on his shoulders she climbed up and stood on\nthe shoulders of the second, kissing her hand to the audience. They did\ntricks with safety bicycles. There is often grace, and even beauty, in\nthe performance of clever acrobats, but this one was so crude, so vulgar\nthat my friend felt positively embarrassed. There is something shameful\nin seeing grown men publicly make fools of themselves. Poor Alix, with a\nfixed and artificial smile on her lips, in her pink tights and green\nsatin trunks, was so grotesque that he wondered how he could have let\nhimself feel a moment's annoyance because when he went to her apartment\nshe had not recognised him. It was with a shrug of the shoulders,\ncondescendingly, that he went round to the stage door afterwards and\ngave the door-keeper a shilling to take her his card. In a few minutes\nshe came out. She seemed delighted to see him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, how good it is to see the face of someone you know in this sad\ncity,' she said. 'Ah, now you can give me that dinner you asked me to in\nParis. I'm dying of hunger. I never eat before the show. Imagine that\nthey should have given us such a bad place on the programme. It's an\ninsult. But we shall see the agent to-morrow. If they think they can put\nupon us like that they are mistaken. <i>Ah, non, non et non!</i> And what an\naudience! No enthusiasm, no applause, nothing.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My friend was staggered. Was it possible that she took her performance\nseriously? He almost burst out laughing. But she still spoke with that\nthroaty voice that had such a queer effect on his nerves. She was\ndressed all in red and wore the same red hat in which he had first seen\nher. She looked so flashy that he did not fancy the notion of asking her\nto a place where he might be seen and so suggested Soho. There were\nhansoms still in those days, and the hansom was more conducive to\nlove-making, I imagine, than is the taxi of the present time. My friend\nput his arm round Alix's waist and kissed her. It left her calm, but on\nthe other hand did not wildly excite him. While they ate a late dinner\nhe made himself very gallant and she played up to him agreeably; but\nwhen they got up to go and he proposed that she should come round to his\nrooms in Waverton Street she told him that a friend had come over from\nParis with her and that she had to meet him at eleven: she had only been\nable to dine with Brown because her companion had a business engagement.\nBrown was exasperated, but did not want to show it, and when, as they\nwalked down Wardour Street (for she said she wanted to go to the Café\nMonico), pausing in front of a pawnbroker's to look at the jewellery in\nthe window, she went into ecstasies over a bracelet of sapphires and\ndiamonds that Brown thought incredibly vulgar, he asked her if she would\nlike it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'But it's marked fifteen pounds,' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He went in and bought it for her. She was delighted. She made him leave\nher just before they came to Piccadilly Circus.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Now listen, <i>mon petit</i>,' she said, 'I cannot see you in London\nbecause of my friend, he is jealous as a wolf, that is why I think it is\nmore prudent for you to go now, but I am playing at Boulogne next week,\nwhy do you not come over? I shall be alone there. My friend has to go\nback to Holland, where he lives.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'All right,' said Brown, 'I'll come.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When he went to Boulogne--he had two days' leave--it was with the one\nidea of salving the wound to his pride. It was odd that he should care.\nI daresay to you it seems inexplicable. He could not bear the notion\nthat Alix looked upon him as a fool and he felt that when once he had\nremoved that impression from her he would never bother about her again.\nHe thought of O'Malley too, and of Yvonne. She must have told them and\nit galled him to think that people whom in his heart he despised should\nlaugh at him behind his back. Do you think he was very contemptible?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good gracious, no,\" said Ashenden. \"All sensible people know that\nvanity is the most devastating, the most universal and the most\nineradicable of the passions that afflict the soul of man, and it is\nonly vanity that makes him deny its power. It is more consuming than\nlove. With advancing years, mercifully, you can snap your fingers at the\nterror and the servitude of love, but age cannot free you from the\nthraldom of vanity. Time can assuage the pangs of love, but only death\ncan still the anguish of wounded vanity. Love is simple and seeks no\nsubterfuge, but vanity cozens you with a hundred disguises. It is part\nand parcel of every virtue: it is the mainspring of courage and the\nstrength of ambition; it gives constancy to the lover and endurance to\nthe stoic; it adds fuel to the fire of the artist's desire for fame and\nis at once the support and the compensation of the honest man's\nintegrity; it leers even cynically in the humility of the saint. You\ncannot escape it, and should you take pains to guard against it, it will\nmake use of those very pains to trip you up. You are defenceless against\nits onslaught because you know not on what unprotected side it will\nattack you. Sincerity cannot protect you from its snare nor humour from\nits mockery.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden stopped, not because he had said all he had to say, but because\nhe was out of breath. He noticed also that the ambassador, desiring to\ntalk rather than to listen, heard him with a politeness that was\nstrained. But he had made this speech not so much for his host's\nedification as for his own entertainment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is vanity finally that makes man support his abominable lot.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a minute Sir Herbert was silent. He looked straight in front of him\nas though his thoughts lingered distressfully on some far horizon of\nmemory.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When my friend came back from Boulogne he knew that he was madly in\nlove with Alix and he had arranged to meet her again in a fortnight's\ntime when she would be performing at Dunkirk. He thought of nothing else\nin the interval and the night before he was to start, he only had\nthirty-six hours this time, he could not sleep, so devouring was the\npassion that consumed him. Then he went over for a night to Paris to see\nher and once when she was disengaged for a week he persuaded her to come\nto London. He knew that she did not love him. He was just a man among a\nhundred others and she made no secret of the fact that he was not her\nonly lover. He suffered agonies of jealousy but knew that it would only\nexcite her ridicule or her anger if he showed it. She had not even a\nfancy for him. She liked him because he was a gentleman and well\ndressed. She was quite willing to be his mistress so long as the claims\nhe made on her were not irksome. But that was all. His means were not\nlarge enough to enable him to make her any serious offers, but even if\nthey had been, liking her freedom, she would have refused.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what about the Dutchman?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Dutchman? He was a pure invention. She made him up on the spur of\nthe moment because for one reason or another she did not just then want\nto be bothered with Brown. What should one lie more or less matter to\nher? Don't think he didn't struggle against his passion. He knew it was\nmadness; he knew that a permanent connection between them could only\nlead to disaster for him. He had no illusions about her: she was common,\ncoarse and vulgar. She could talk of none of the things that interested\nhim, nor did she try, she took it for granted that he was concerned with\nher affairs and told him interminable stories of her quarrels with\nfellow-performers, her disputes with managers and her wrangles with\nhotel-keepers. What she said bored him to death, but the sound of her\nthroaty voice made his heart beat so that sometimes he thought he would\nsuffocate.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden sat uneasily in his chair. It was a Sheraton chair very good to\nlook at, but hard and straight; and he wished that Sir Herbert had had\nthe notion of going back to the other room where there was a comfortable\nsofa. It was quite plain now that the story he was telling was about\nhimself and Ashenden felt a certain indelicacy in the man's stripping\nhis soul before him so nakedly. He did not desire this confidence to be\nforced upon him. Sir Herbert Witherspoon meant nothing to him. By the\nlight of the shaded candles Ashenden saw that he was deathly pale and\nthere was a wildness in his eyes that in that cold and composed man was\nstrangely disconcerting. He poured himself out a glass of water; his\nthroat was dry so that he could hardly speak. But he went on pitilessly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At last my friend managed to pull himself together. He was disgusted by\nthe sordidness of his intrigue; there was no beauty in it, nothing but\nshame; and it was leading to nothing. His passion was as vulgar as the\nwoman for whom he felt it. Now it happened that Alix was going to spend\nsix months in the North of Africa with her troupe and for that time at\nleast it would be impossible for him to see her. He made up his mind\nthat he must seize the opportunity and make a definite break. He knew\nbitterly that it would mean nothing to her. In three weeks she would\nhave forgotten him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And then there was something else. He had come to know very well some\npeople, a man and his wife, whose social and political connections were\nextremely important. They had an only daughter and, I don't know why,\nshe fell in love with him. She was everything that Alix was not, pretty\nin the real English way, with blue eyes and pink and white cheeks, tall\nand fair; she might have stepped out of one of du Maurier's pictures in\n<i>Punch</i>. She was clever and well-read, and since she had lived all her\nlife in political circles she could talk intelligently of the sort of\nthings that interested him. He had reason to believe that if he asked\nher to marry him she would accept. I have told you that he was\nambitious. He knew that he had great abilities and he wanted the chance\nto use them. She was related to some of the greatest families in England\nand he would have been a fool not to realise that a marriage of this\nkind must make his path infinitely easier. The opportunity was golden.\nAnd what a relief to think that he could put behind him definitely that\nugly little episode, and what a happiness, instead of that wall of\ncheerful indifference and matter-of-fact good nature against which in\nhis passion for Alix he had vainly battered his head, what a happiness\nto feel that to someone else he really meant something! How could he\nhelp being flattered and touched when he saw her face light up as he\ncame into the room? He wasn't in love with her, but he thought her\ncharming, and he wanted to forget Alix and the vulgar life into which\nshe had led him. At last he made up his mind. He asked her to marry him\nand was accepted. Her family was delighted. The marriage was to take\nplace in the autumn, since her father had to go on some political errand\nto South America and was taking his wife and daughter with him. They\nwere to be gone the whole summer. My friend Brown was transferring from\nthe F.O. to the diplomatic service and had been promised a post at\nLisbon. He was to go there immediately.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He saw his fiancée off. Then it happened that owing to some hitch the\nman whom Brown was going to replace was kept at Lisbon three months\nlonger and so for that period my friend found himself at a loose end.\nAnd just when he was making up his mind what to do with himself he\nreceived a letter from Alix. She was coming back to France and had a\ntour booked; she gave him a long list of the places she was going to,\nand in her casual, friendly way said that they would have fun if he\ncould manage to run over for a day or two. An insane, a criminal notion\nseized him. If she had shown any eagerness for him to come he might have\nresisted, it was her airy, matter-of-fact indifference that took him. On\na sudden he longed for her. He did not care if she was gross and vulgar,\nhe had got her in his bones, and it was his last chance. In a little\nwhile he was going to be married. It was now or never. He went down to\nMarseilles and met her as she stepped off the boat that had brought her\nfrom Tunis. His heart leaped at the pleasure she showed on seeing him.\nHe knew he loved her madly. He told her that he was going to be married\nin three months and asked her to spend the last of his freedom with him.\nShe refused to abandon her tour. How could she leave her companions in\nthe lurch? He offered to compensate them, but she would not hear of it;\nthey could not find someone to take her place at a moment's notice, nor\ncould they afford to throw over a good engagement that might lead to\nothers in the future; they were honest people, and they kept their word,\nthey had their duty to their managers and their duty to their public. He\nwas exasperated; it seemed absurd that his whole happiness should be\nsacrificed to that wretched tour. And at the end of the three months?\nWhat was to happen to her then? Oh, no, he was asking something that\nwasn't reasonable. He told her that he adored her. He did not know till\nthen how insanely he loved her. Well, then, she said, why did he not\ncome with her and make the tour with them? She would be glad of his\ncompany; they could have a good time together and at the end of three\nmonths he could go and marry his heiress and neither of them would be\nany the worse. For a moment he hesitated, but now that he saw her again\nhe could not bear the thought of being parted from her so soon. He\naccepted. And then she said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'But listen, my little one, you mustn't be silly, you know. The\nmanagers won't be too pleased with me if I make a lot of chichi, I have\nto think of my future, and they won't be so anxious to have me back if I\nrefuse to please old customers of the house. It won't be very often, but\nit must be understood that you are not to make me scenes if now and then\nI give myself to someone whose fancy I take. It will mean nothing, that\nis business, you will be my <i>amant de coeur</i>.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He felt a strange, excruciating pain in his heart, and I think he went\nso pale that she thought he was going to faint. She looked at him\ncuriously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Those are the terms,' she said. 'You can either take them or leave\nthem.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He accepted.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSir Herbert Witherspoon leaned forward in his chair and he was so white\nthat Ashenden thought too that he was going to faint. His skin was drawn\nover his skull so that his face looked like a death's head, but the\nveins on his forehead stood out like knotted cords. He had lost all\nreticence. And Ashenden once more wished that he would stop, it made him\nshy and nervous to see the man's naked soul: no one has the right to\nshow himself to another in that destitute state. He was inclined to cry:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Stop, stop. You mustn't tell me any more. You'll be so ashamed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the man had lost all shame.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For three months they travelled together from one dull provincial town\nto another, sharing a filthy little bedroom in frowsy hotels; Alix would\nnot let him take her to good hotels, she said she had not the clothes\nfor them and she was more comfortable in the sort of hotel she was used\nto; she did not want her companions in the business to say that she was\nputting on side. He sat interminable hours in shabby cafés. He was\ntreated as a brother by members of the troupe, they called him by his\nChristian name and chaffed him coarsely and slapped him on the back. He\nran errands for them when they were busy with their work. He saw the\ngood-humoured contempt in the eyes of managers and was obliged to put up\nwith the familiarity of stage-hands. They travelled third-class from\nplace to place and he helped to carry the luggage. He with whom reading\nwas a passion never opened a book because Alix was bored by reading and\nthought that anyone who did was just giving himself airs. Every night he\nwent to the music-hall and watched her go through that grotesque and\nignoble performance. He had to fall in with her pathetic fancy that it\nwas artistic. He had to congratulate her when it had gone well and\ncondole with her when some feat of agility had gone amiss. When she had\nfinished he went to a café and waited for her while she changed, and\nsometimes she would come in rather hurriedly and say:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Don't wait for me to-night, <i>mon chou</i>, I'm busy.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And then he would undergo agonies of jealousy. He would suffer as he\nnever knew a man could suffer. She would come back to the hotel at three\nor four in the morning. She wondered why he was not asleep. Sleep! How\ncould he sleep with that misery gnawing at his heart? He had promised he\nwould not interfere with her. He did not keep his promise. He made her\nterrific scenes. Sometimes he beat her. Then she would lose her patience\nand tell him she was sick of him, she would pack her things to go, and\nthen he would go grovelling to her, promising anything, any submission,\nvowing to swallow any humiliation, if she would not leave him. It was\nhorrible and degrading. He was miserable. Miserable? No, he was happier\nthan he'd ever been in his life. It was the gutter that he wallowed in,\nbut he wallowed in it with delight. Oh, he was so bored with the life\nhe'd led hitherto, and this one seemed to him amazing and romantic. This\nwas reality. And that frowsy, ugly woman with the whisky voice, she had\nsuch a splendid vitality, such a zest for life that she seemed to raise\nhis own to some more vivid level. It really did seem to him to burn with\na pure, gem-like flame. Do people still read Pater?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know,\" said Ashenden. \"I don't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There was only three months of it. Oh, how short the time seemed and\nhow quickly the weeks sped by! Sometimes he had wild dreams of\nabandoning everything and throwing in his lot with the acrobats. They\nhad come to have quite a liking for him and they said he could easily\ntrain himself to take a part in the turn. He knew they said it more in\njest than in earnest, but the notion vaguely tickled him. But these were\nonly dreams and he knew that nothing would come of them. He never really\nchaffered with the thought that when the three months came to an end he\nwould not return to his own life with its obligations. With his mind,\nthat cold, logical mind of his, he knew it would be absurd to sacrifice\neverything for a woman like Alix; he was ambitious, he wanted power; and\nbesides, he could not break the heart of that poor child who loved and\ntrusted him. She wrote to him once a week. She was longing to get back,\nthe time seemed endless to her and he, he had a secret wish that\nsomething would happen to delay her arrival. If he could only have a\nlittle more time! Perhaps if he had six months he would have got over\nhis infatuation. Already sometimes he hated Alix.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The last day came. They seemed to have little to say to one another.\nThey were both sad; but he knew that Alix only regretted the breaking of\nan agreeable habit, in twenty-four hours she would be as gay and full of\nspirits with her stray companion as though he had never crossed her\npath; he could only think that next day he was going to Paris to meet\nhis fiancée and her family. They spent their last night in one another's\narms weeping. If she'd asked him then not to leave her it may be that he\nwould have stayed; but she didn't, it never occurred to her, she\naccepted his going as a settled thing, and she wept not because she\nloved him, she wept because he was unhappy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In the morning she was sleeping so soundly that he had not the heart to\nwake her to say good-bye. He slipped out very quietly, with his bag in\nhis hand, and took the train to Paris.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden turned away his head, for he saw two tears form themselves in\nWitherspoon's eyes and roll down his cheeks. He did not even try to hide\nthem. Ashenden lit another cigar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In Paris they cried out when they saw him. They said he looked like a\nghost. He told them he'd been ill and hadn't said anything about it in\norder not to worry them. They were very kind. A month later he was\nmarried. He did very well for himself. He was given opportunities to\ndistinguish himself and he distinguished himself. His rise was\nspectacular. He had the well-ordered and distinguished establishment\nthat he had wanted. He had the power for which he had craved. He was\nloaded with honours. Oh, he made a success of life and there were\nhundreds who envied him. It was all ashes. He was bored, bored to\ndistraction, bored by that distinguished, beautiful lady he had married,\nbored by the people his life forced him to live with; it was a comedy he\nwas playing and sometimes it seemed intolerable to live for ever and\never behind a mask, sometimes he felt he couldn't bear it. But he bore\nit. Sometimes he longed for Alix so fiercely that he felt it would be\nbetter to shoot himself than to suffer such anguish. He never saw her\nagain. Never. He heard from O'Malley that she had married and left her\ntroupe. She must be a fat old woman now and it doesn't matter any more.\nBut he had wasted his life. And he never even made that poor creature\nwhom he married happy. How could he go on hiding from her year after\nyear that he had nothing to give her but pity? Once in his agony he told\nher about Alix and she tortured him ever after with her jealousy. He\nknew that he should never have married her; in six months she would have\ngot over her grief if he had told her he could not bear to, and in the\nend would have happily married somebody else. So far as she was\nconcerned his sacrifice was vain. He was terribly conscious that he had\nonly one life and it seemed so sad to think that he had wasted it. He\ncould never surmount his immeasurable regret. He laughed when people\nspoke of him as a strong man: he was as weak and unstable as water. And\nthat's why I tell you that Byring is right. Even though it only lasts\nfive years, even though he ruins his career, even though this marriage\nof his ends in disaster, it will have been worth while. He will have\nbeen satisfied. He will have fulfilled himself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment the door opened and a lady came in. The ambassador\nglanced at her and for an instant a look of cold hatred crossed his\nface, but it was only for an instant; then, rising from the table, he\ncomposed his ravaged features to an expression of courteous suavity. He\ngave the incomer a haggard smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Here is my wife. This is Mr. Ashenden.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I couldn't imagine where you were. Why didn't you go and sit in your\nstudy? I'm sure Mr. Ashenden's been dreadfully uncomfortable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was a tall, thin woman of fifty, rather drawn and faded, but she\nlooked as though she had once been pretty. It was obvious that she was\nvery well-bred. She vaguely reminded you of an exotic plant, reared in a\nhot-house, that had begun to lose its bloom. She was dressed in black.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What was the concert like?\" asked Sir Herbert.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, not bad at all. They gave a Brahms Concerto and the Fire-music from\nthe <i>Walküre</i>, and some Hungarian dances of Dvoràk. I thought them\nrather showy.\" She turned to Ashenden. \"I hope you haven't been bored\nall alone with my husband. What have you been talking about? Art and\nLiterature?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, its raw material,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took his leave.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ashenden went on deck and saw before him a low-lying coast and a\nwhite town he felt a pleasant flutter of excitement. It was early and\nthe sun had not long risen, but the sea was glassy and the sky was blue;\nit was warm already and one knew that the day would be sweltering.\nVladivostok. It really gave one the sensation of being at the end of the\nworld. It was a long journey that Ashenden had made from New York to San\nFrancisco, across the Pacific in a Japanese boat to Yokohama, then from\nTsuruki in a Russian boat, he the only Englishman on board, up the Sea\nof Japan. From Vladivostok he was to take the Trans-Siberian to\nPetrograd. It was the most important mission that he had ever had and he\nwas pleased with the sense of responsibility that it gave him. He had no\none to give him orders, unlimited funds (he carried in a belt next to\nhis skin bills of exchange for a sum so enormous that he was staggered\nwhen he thought of them), and though he had been set to do something\nthat was beyond human possibility he did not know this and was prepared\nto set about his task with confidence. He believed in his own\nastuteness. Though he had both esteem and admiration for the sensibility\nof the human race, he had little respect for their intelligence: man has\nalways found it easier to sacrifice his life than to learn the\nmultiplication table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden did not much look forward to ten days on a Russian train, and\nin Yokohama he had heard rumours that in one or two places bridges had\nbeen blown up and the line cut. He was told that the soldiers,\ncompletely out of hand, would rob him of everything he possessed and\nturn him out on the steppe to shift for himself. It was a cheerful\nprospect. But the train was certainly starting and whatever happened\nlater (and Ashenden had always a feeling that things never turned out as\nbadly as you expected) he was determined to get a place on it. His\nintention on landing was to go at once to the British Consulate and find\nout what arrangements had been made for him; but as they neared the\nshore and he was able to discern the untidy and bedraggled town he felt\nnot a little forlorn. He knew but a few words of Russian. The only man\non the ship who spoke English was the purser and though he promised\nAshenden to do anything he could to help him, Ashenden had the\nimpression that he must not too greatly count upon him. It was a relief\nthen, when they docked, to have a young man, small and with a mop of\nuntidy hair, obviously a Jew, come up to him and ask if his name was\nAshenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mine is Benedict. I'm the interpreter at the British Consulate. I've\nbeen told to look after you. We've got you a place on the train\nto-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden's spirits went up. They landed. The little Jew looked after his\nluggage and had his passport examined and then, getting into a car that\nwaited for them, they drove off to the Consulate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've had instructions to offer you every facility,\" said the Consul,\n\"and you've only got to tell me what you want. I've fixed you up all\nright on the train, but God knows if you'll ever get to Petrograd. Oh,\nby the way, I've got a travelling companion for you. He's a man called\nHarrington, an American, and he's going to Petrograd for a firm in\nPhiladelphia. He's trying to fix up some deal with the Provisional\nGovernment.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's he like?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, he's all right. I wanted him to come with the American Consul to\nluncheon, but they've gone for an excursion in the country. You must get\nto the station a couple of hours before the train starts. There's always\nan awful scrimmage and if you're not there in good time someone will\npinch your seat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe train started at midnight and Ashenden dined with Benedict at the\nstation restaurant, which was, it appeared, the only place in that\nslatternly town where you could get a decent meal. It was crowded. The\nservice was intolerably slow. Then they went on to the platform, where,\nthough they had still two hours to spare, there was already a seething\nmob. Whole families, sitting on piles of luggage, seemed to be camped\nthere. People rushed to and fro, or stood in little groups violently\narguing. Women screamed. Others were silently weeping. Here two men were\nengaged in a fierce quarrel. It was a scene of indescribable confusion.\nThe light in the station was wan and cold and the white faces of all\nthose people were like the white faces of the dead waiting, patient or\nanxious, distraught or penitent, for the judgment of the last day. The\ntrain was made up and most of the carriages were already filled to\noverflowing. When at last Benedict found that in which Ashenden had his\nplace a man sprang out of it excitedly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come in and sit down,\" he said. \"I've had the greatest difficulty in\nkeeping your seat. A fellow wanted to come in here with a wife and two\nchildren. My Consul has just gone off with him to see the\nstationmaster.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is Mr. Harrington,\" said Benedict.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden stepped into the carriage. It had two berths in it. The porter\nstowed his luggage away. He shook hands with his travelling companion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. John Quincy Harrington was a very thin man of somewhat less than\nmiddle height, he had a yellow, bony face, with large, pale-blue eyes\nand when he took off his hat to wipe his brow wet from the perturbation\nhe had endured he showed a large, bald skull; it was very bony and the\nridges and protuberances stood out disconcertingly. He wore a\nbowler-hat, a black coat and waistcoat, and a pair of striped trousers;\na very high white collar and a neat, unobtrusive tie. Ashenden did not\nknow precisely how you should dress in order to take a ten days' journey\nacross Siberia, but he could not but think that Mr. Harrington's costume\nwas eccentric. He spoke with precision in a high-pitched voice and in an\naccent that Ashenden recognised as that of New England.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn a minute the stationmaster came accompanied by a bearded Russian,\nsuffering evidently from profound emotion, and followed by a lady\nholding two children by the hand. The Russian, tears running down his\nface, was talking with quivering lips to the stationmaster, and his wife\nbetween her sobs was apparently telling him the story of her life. When\nthey arrived at the carriage the altercation became more violent and\nBenedict joined in with his fluent Russian. Mr. Harrington did not know\na word of the language, but being obviously of an excitable turn broke\nin and explained in voluble English that these seats had been booked by\nthe Consuls of Great Britain and the United States respectively, and\nthough he didn't know about the King of England, he could tell them\nstraight and they could take it from him that the President of the\nUnited States would never permit an American citizen to be done out of a\nseat on the train that he had duly paid for. He would yield to force,\nbut to nothing else, and if they touched him he would register a\ncomplaint with the Consul at once. He said all this and a great deal\nmore to the stationmaster, who of course had no notion what he was\ntalking about, but with much emphasis and a good deal of gesticulation\nmade him in reply a passionate speech. This roused Mr. Harrington to the\nutmost pitch of indignation, for shaking his fist in the stationmaster's\nface, his own pale with fury, he cried out:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell him I don't understand a word he says and I don't want to\nunderstand. If the Russians want us to look upon them as a civilised\npeople, why don't they talk a civilised language? Tell him that I am Mr.\nJohn Quincy Harrington and I'm travelling on behalf of Messrs. Crewe and\nAdams of Philadelphia with a special letter of introduction to Mr.\nKerensky and if I'm not left in peaceful possession of this carriage Mr.\nCrewe will take the matter up with the Administration in Washington.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington's manner was so truculent and his gestures so menacing\nthat the stationmaster, throwing up the sponge, turned on his heel\nwithout another word and walked moodily away. He was followed by the\nbearded Russian and his wife arguing heatedly with him and the two\napathetic children. Mr. Harrington jumped back into the carriage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm terribly sorry to have to refuse to give up my seat to a lady with\ntwo children,\" he said. \"No one knows better than I the respect due to a\nwoman and a mother, but I've got to get to Petrograd by this train if I\ndon't want to lose a very important order and I'm not going to spend ten\ndays in a corridor for all the mothers in Russia.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't blame you,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am a married man and I have two children myself. I know that\ntravelling with your family is a difficult matter, but there's nothing\nthat I know to prevent you from staying at home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen you are shut up with a man for ten days in a railway carriage you\ncan hardly fail to learn most of what there is to know about him, and\nfor ten days (for eleven to be exact) Ashenden spent twenty-four hours a\nday with Mr. Harrington. It is true that they went into the dining-room\nthree times a day for their meals, but they sat opposite to one another;\nit is true that the train stopped for an hour morning and afternoon so\nthat they were able to have a tramp up and down the platform, but they\nwalked side by side. Ashenden made acquaintance with some of his\nfellow-travellers and sometimes they came into the compartment to have a\nchat, but if they only spoke French or German Mr. Harrington would watch\nthem with acidulous disapproval and if they spoke English he would never\nlet them get a word in. For Mr. Harrington was a talker. He talked as\nthough it were a natural function of the human being, automatically, as\nmen breathe or digest their food; he talked not because he had something\nto say, but because he could not help himself, in a high-pitched, nasal\nvoice, without inflection, at one dead level of tone. He talked with\nprecision, using a copious vocabulary and forming his sentences with\ndeliberation; he never used a short word when a longer one would do; he\nnever paused. He went on and on. It was not a torrent, for there was\nnothing impetuous about it, it was like a stream of lava pouring\nirresistibly down the side of a volcano. It flowed with a quiet and\nsteady force that overwhelmed everything that was in its path.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden thought he had never known as much about anyone as he knew\nabout Mr. Harrington, and not only about him, with all his opinions,\nhabits and circumstances, but about his wife and his wife's family, his\nchildren and their schoolfellows, his employers and the alliances they\nhad made for three or four generations with the best families of\nPhiladelphia. His own family had come from Devonshire early in the\neighteenth century and Mr. Harrington had been to the village where the\ngraves of his forebears were still to be seen in the churchyard. He was\nproud of his English ancestry, but proud too of his American birth,\nthough to him America was a little strip of land along the Atlantic\ncoast and Americans were a small number of persons of English or Dutch\norigin whose blood had never been sullied by foreign admixture. He\nlooked upon the Germans, Swedes, Irish and the inhabitants of Central\nand Eastern Europe who for the last hundred years have descended upon\nthe United States as interlopers. He turned his attention away from them\nas a maiden lady who lived in a secluded manor might avert her eyes from\nthe factory chimneys that had trespassed upon her retirement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ashenden mentioned a man of vast wealth who owned some of the\nfinest pictures in America Mr. Harrington said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've never met him. My great-aunt Maria Penn Warmington always said his\ngrandmother was a very good cook. My great-aunt Maria was terribly sorry\nwhen she left her to get married. She said she never knew anyone who\ncould make an apple pancake as she could.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington was devoted to his wife and he told Ashenden at\nunbelievable length how cultivated and what a perfect mother she was.\nShe had delicate health and had undergone a great number of operations\nall of which he described in detail. He had had two operations himself,\none on his tonsils and one to remove his appendix and he took Ashenden\nday by day through his experiences. All his friends had had operations\nand his knowledge of surgery was encyclopædic. He had two sons, both at\nschool, and he was seriously considering whether he would not be\nwell-advised to have them operated on. It was curious that one of them\nshould have enlarged tonsils, and he was not at all happy about the\nappendix of the other. They were more devoted to one another than he had\never seen two brothers be and a very good friend of his, the brightest\nsurgeon in Philadelphia, had offered to operate on them both together so\nthat they should not be separated. He showed Ashenden photographs of the\nboys and their mother. This journey of his to Russia was the first time\nin their lives that he had been separated from them and every morning he\nwrote a long letter to his wife telling her everything that had happened\nand a good deal of what he had said during the day. Ashenden watched him\ncover sheet after sheet of paper with his neat, legible and precise\nhandwriting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington had read all the books on conversation and knew its\ntechnique to the last detail. He had a little book in which he noted\ndown the stories he heard and he told Ashenden that when he was going\nout to dinner he always looked up half a dozen so that he should not be\nat a loss. They were marked with a G if they could be told in general\nsociety and with an M (for men) if they were more fit for rough\nmasculine ears. He was a specialist in that peculiar form of anecdote\nthat consists in narrating a long serious incident, piling detail upon\ndetail, till a comic end is reached. He spared you nothing and Ashenden\nforeseeing the point long before it arrived would clench his hands and\nknit his brows in the strenuous effort not to betray his impatience and\nat last force from his unwilling mouth a grim and hollow laugh. If\nsomeone came into the compartment in the middle Mr. Harrington would\ngreet him with cordiality.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come right in and sit down. I was just telling my friend a story. You\nmust listen to it, it's one of the funniest things you ever heard.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he would begin again from the very beginning and repeat it word for\nword, without altering a single apt epithet, till he reached the\nhumorous end. Ashenden suggested once that they should see whether they\ncould find two people on the train who played cards so that they might\nwhile away the time with a game of bridge, but Mr. Harrington said he\nnever touched cards and when Ashenden in desperation began to play\npatience he pulled a wry face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It beats me how an intelligent man can waste his time card-playing, and\nof all the unintellectual pursuits I have ever seen it seems to me that\nsolitaire is the worst. It kills conversation. Man is a social animal\nand he exercises the highest part of his nature when he takes part in\nsocial intercourse.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is a certain elegance in wasting time,\" said Ashenden. \"Any fool\ncan waste money, but when you waste time you waste what is priceless.\nBesides,\" he added with bitterness, \"you can still talk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How can I talk when your attention is taken up by whether you are going\nto get a black seven to put on a red eight? Conversation calls forth the\nhighest powers of the intellect and if you have made a study of it you\nhave the right to expect that the person you're talking to will give you\nthe fullest attention he is capable of.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not say this acrimoniously, but with the good-humoured patience\nof a man who has been much tried. He was just stating a plain fact and\nAshenden could take it or leave it. It was the claim of the artist to\nhave his work taken seriously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington was a diligent reader. He read pencil in hand,\nunderlining passages that attracted his attention and on the margin\nmaking in his neat writing comments on what he read. This he was fond of\ndiscussing and when Ashenden himself was reading and felt on a sudden\nthat Mr. Harrington, book in one hand and pencil in the other, was\nlooking at him with his large pale eyes he began to have violent\npalpitations of the heart. He dared not look up, he dared not even turn\nthe page, for he knew that Mr. Harrington would regard this as ample\nexcuse to break into a discourse, but remained with his eyes fixed\ndesperately on a single word, like a chicken with its beak to a chalk\nline, and only ventured to breathe when he realised that Mr. Harrington,\nhaving given up the attempt, had resumed his reading. He was then\nengaged on a History of the American Constitution in two volumes and for\nrecreation was perusing a stout volume that purported to contain all the\ngreat speeches of the world. For Mr. Harrington was an after-dinner\nspeaker and had read all the best books on speaking in public. He knew\nexactly how to get on good terms with his audience, just where to put in\nthe serious words that touched their hearts, how to catch their\nattention by a few apt stories and finally with what degree of\neloquence, suiting the occasion, to deliver his peroration.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington was very fond of reading aloud. Ashenden had had frequent\noccasion to observe the distressing propensity of Americans for this\npastime. In hotel drawing-rooms at night after dinner he had often seen\nthe father of a family seated in a retired corner and surrounded by his\nwife, his two sons and his daughter, reading to them. On ships crossing\nthe Atlantic he had sometimes watched with awe the tall, spare gentleman\nof commanding aspect who sat in the centre of fifteen ladies no longer\nin their first youth and in a resonant voice read to them the history of\nArt. Walking up and down the promenade deck he had passed honeymooning\ncouples lying on deck-chairs and caught the unhurried tones of the bride\nas she read to her young husband the pages of a popular novel. It had\nalways seemed to him a curious way of showing affection. He had had\nfriends who had offered to read to him and he had known women who had\nsaid they loved being read to, but he had always politely refused the\ninvitation and firmly ignored the hint. He liked neither reading aloud\nnor being read aloud to. In his heart he thought the national\npredilection for this form of entertainment the only flaw in the\nperfection of the American character. But the immortal gods love a good\nlaugh at the expense of human beings and now delivered him, bound and\nhelpless, to the knife of the high priest. Mr. Harrington flattered\nhimself that he was a very good reader and he explained to Ashenden the\ntheory and practice of the art. Ashenden learned that there were two\nschools, the dramatic and the natural: in the first you imitated the\nvoices of those who spoke (if you were reading a novel), and when the\nheroine wailed you wailed and when emotion choked her you choked too;\nbut in the other you read as impassively as though you were reading the\nprice-list of a mail-order house in Chicago. This was the school Mr.\nHarrington belonged to. In the seventeen years of his married life he\nhad read aloud to his wife, and to his sons as soon as they were old\nenough to appreciate them, the novels of Sir Walter Scott, Jane Austen,\nDickens, the Brontë Sisters, Thackeray, George Eliot, Nathaniel\nHawthorne and W. D. Howells. Ashenden came to the conclusion that it was\nsecond nature with Mr. Harrington to read aloud and to prevent him from\ndoing so made him as uneasy as cutting off his tobacco made the\nconfirmed smoker. He would take you unawares.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Listen to this,\" he would say, \"you must listen to this,\" as though he\nwere suddenly struck by the excellence of a maxim or the neatness of a\nphrase. \"Now just tell me if you don't think this is remarkably well\nput. It's only three lines.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe read them and Ashenden was willing to give him a moment's attention,\nbut having finished them, without pausing for a moment to take breath,\nhe went on. He went right on. On and on. In his measured high-pitched\nvoice, without emphasis or expression, he read page after page. Ashenden\nfidgeted, crossed and uncrossed his legs, lit cigarettes and smoked\nthem, sat first in one position, then in another. Mr. Harrington went on\nand on. The train went leisurely through the interminable steppes of\nSiberia. They passed villages and crossed rivers. Mr. Harrington went on\nand on. When he finished a great speech by Edmund Burke he put down the\nbook in triumph.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now that in my opinion is one of the finest orations in the English\nlanguage. It is certainly a part of our common heritage that we can look\nupon with genuine pride.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Doesn't it seem to you a little ominous that the people to whom Edmund\nBurke made that speech are all dead?\" asked Ashenden gloomily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington was about to reply that this was hardly to be wondered at\nsince the speech was made in the eighteenth century, when it dawned upon\nhim that Ashenden (bearing up wonderfully under affliction as any\nunprejudiced person could not fail to admit) was making a joke. He\nslapped his knee and laughed heartily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gee, that's a good one,\" he said. \"I'll write that down in my little\nbook. I see exactly how I can bring it in one time when I have to speak\nat our luncheon club.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington was a highbrow; but that appellation, invented by the\nvulgar as a term of abuse, he had accepted like the instrument of a\nsaint's martyrdom, the gridiron of Saint Laurence for instance or the\nwheel of Saint Catherine, as an honorific title. He gloried in it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Emerson was a highbrow,\" he said. \"Longfellow was a highbrow. Oliver\nWendell Holmes was a highbrow. James Russell Lowell was a highbrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington's study of American literature had taken him no further\ndown the years than the period during which those eminent, but not\nprecisely thrilling, authors flourished.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington was a bore. He exasperated Ashenden, and enraged him; he\ngot on his nerves, and drove him to frenzy. But Ashenden did not dislike\nhim. His self-satisfaction was enormous but so ingenuous that you could\nnot resent it; his conceit was so childlike that you could only smile at\nit. He was so well-meaning, so thoughtful, so deferential, so polite\nthat though Ashenden would willingly have killed him he could not but\nown that in that short while he had conceived for Mr. Harrington\nsomething very like affection. His manners were perfect, formal, a\ntrifle elaborate perhaps (there is no harm in that, for good manners are\nthe product of an artificial state of society and so can bear a touch of\nthe powdered wig and the lace ruffle), but though natural to his good\nbreeding they gained a pleasant significance from his good heart. He was\nready to do anyone a kindness and seemed to find nothing too much\ntrouble if he could thereby oblige his fellow-man. He was eminently\n<i>serviable</i>. And it may be that this is a word for which there is no\nexact translation because the charming quality it denotes is not very\ncommon among our practical people. When Ashenden was ill for a couple of\ndays Mr. Harrington nursed him with devotion. Ashenden was embarrassed\nby the care he took of him and though racked with pain could not help\nlaughing at the fussy attention with which Mr. Harrington took his\ntemperature, from his neatly packed valise extracted a whole regiment of\ntabloids and firmly doctored him; and he was touched by the trouble he\ngave himself to get from the dining-car the things that he thought\nAshenden could eat. He did everything in the world for him but stop\ntalking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was only when he was dressing that Mr. Harrington was silent, for\nthen his maidenly mind was singly occupied with the problem of changing\nhis clothes before Ashenden without indelicacy. He was extremely modest.\nHe changed his linen every day, neatly taking it out of his suitcase and\nneatly putting back what was soiled; but he performed miracles of\ndexterity in order during the process not to show an inch of bare skin.\nAfter a day or two Ashenden gave up the struggle to keep neat and clean\nin that dirty train, with one lavatory for the whole carriage, and soon\nwas as grubby as the rest of the passengers; but Mr. Harrington refused\nto yield to the difficulties. He performed his toilet with deliberation\nnotwithstanding the impatient persons who rattled the door-handle, and\nreturned from the lavatory every morning washed, shining and smelling of\nsoap. Once dressed, in his black coat, striped trousers and\nwell-polished shoes, he looked as spruce as though he had just stepped\nout of his tidy little red-brick house in Philadelphia and was about to\nboard the street-car that would take him downtown to his office. At one\npoint of the journey it was announced that an attempt had been made to\nblow up a bridge and that there were disturbances at the next station\nover the river; it might be that the train would be stopped and the\npassengers turned adrift or taken prisoner. Ashenden, thinking he might\nbe separated from his luggage, took the precaution to change into his\nthickest clothes so that if he had to pass the winter in Siberia he need\nsuffer as little as necessary from the cold; but Mr. Harrington would\nnot listen to reason; he made no preparations for the possible\nexperience and Ashenden had the conviction that if he spent three months\nin a Russian prison he would still preserve that smart and natty\nappearance. A troop of Cossacks boarded the train and stood on the\nplatform of each carriage with their guns loaded, and the train rattled\ngingerly over the damaged bridge; then they came to the station at which\nthey had been warned of danger, put on steam and dashed straight through\nit. Mr. Harrington was mildly satirical when Ashenden changed back into\na light summer suit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington was a keen business man. It was obvious that it would\nneed someone very astute to overreach him and Ashenden was sure that his\nemployers had been well-advised to send him on this errand. He would\nsafeguard their interests with all his might and if he succeeded in\ndriving a bargain with the Russians it would be a hard one. His loyalty\nto his firm demanded that. He spoke of the partners with affectionate\nreverence. He loved them and was proud of them; but he did not envy them\nbecause their wealth was great. He was quite content to work on a salary\nand thought himself adequately paid; so long as he could educate his\nboys and leave his widow enough to live on, what was money to him? He\nthought it a trifle vulgar to be rich. He looked upon culture as more\nimportant than money. He was careful of it and after every meal put down\nin his note-book exactly what it had cost him. His firm might be certain\nthat he would not charge a penny more for his expenses than he had\nspent. But having discovered that poor people came to the station at the\nstopping places of the train to beg and seeing that the war had really\nbrought them to destitution he took care before each halt to supply\nhimself with ample small change and in a shame-faced way, mocking\nhimself for being taken in by such impostors, distributed everything in\nhis pocket.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I know they don't deserve it,\" he said, \"and I don't do it\nfor them. I do it entirely for my own peace of mind. I should feel so\nterribly badly if I thought some man really was hungry and I'd refused\nto give him the price of a meal.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington was absurd, but lovable. It was inconceivable that anyone\nshould be rude to him, it would have seemed as dreadful as hitting a\nchild; and Ashenden, chafing inwardly but with a pretence of amiability,\nsuffered meekly and with a truly Christian spirit the affliction of the\ngentle, ruthless creature's society. It took eleven days at that time to\nget from Vladivostok to Petrograd and Ashenden felt that he could not\nhave borne another day. If it had been twelve he would have killed Mr.\nHarrington.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen at last (Ashenden tired and dirty, Mr. Harrington neat, sprightly\nand sententious) they reached the outskirts of Petrograd and stood at\nthe window looking at the crowded houses of the city, Mr. Harrington\nturned to Ashenden and said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I never would have thought that eleven days in the train would\npass so quickly. We've had a wonderful time. I've enjoyed your company\nand I know you've enjoyed mine. I'm not going to pretend I don't know\nthat I'm a pretty good conversationalist. But now we've come together\nlike this we must take care to stay together. We must see as much of one\nanother as we can while I'm in Petrograd.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall have a great deal to do,\" said Ashenden. \"I'm afraid my time\nwon't be altogether my own.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know,\" answered Mr. Harrington cordially. \"I expect to be pretty busy\nmyself, but we can have breakfast together anyway and we'll meet in the\nevening and compare notes. It would be too bad if we drifted apart now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Too bad,\" sighed Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ashenden found himself alone in his bedroom for the first time, he\nsat down and looked about him. It had seemed an age. He had not the\nenergy to start immediately to unpack. How many of these hotel bedrooms\nhad he known since the beginning of the war, grand or shabby, in one\nplace and one land after another! It seemed to him that he had been\nliving in his luggage for as long as he could remember. He was weary. He\nasked himself how he was going to set about the work that he had been\nsent to do. He felt lost in the immensity of Russia and very solitary.\nHe had protested when he was chosen for this mission, it looked too\nlarge an order, but his protests were ignored. He was chosen not because\nthose in authority thought him particularly suited for the job, but\nbecause there was no one to be found who was more suited. There was a\nknock at the door and Ashenden, pleased to make use of the few words of\nthe language he knew, called out in Russian. The door was opened. He\nsprang to his feet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come in, come in,\" he cried. \"I'm awfully glad to see you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThree men entered. He knew them by sight, since they had travelled in\nthe same ship with him from San Francisco to Yokohama, but following\ntheir instructions no communications had passed between them and\nAshenden. They were Czechs, exiled from their country for their\nrevolutionary activity and long settled in America, who had been sent\nover to Russia to help Ashenden in his mission and put him in touch with\nProfessor Z., whose authority over the Czechs in Russia was absolute.\nTheir chief was a certain Dr. Egon Orth, a tall thin man, with a little\ngrey head; he was minister to some church in the Middle West and a\ndoctor of divinity; but had abandoned his cure to work for the\nliberation of his country, and Ashenden had the impression that he was\nan intelligent fellow who would not put too fine a point on matters of\nconscience. A parson with a fixed idea has this advantage over common\nmen, that he can persuade himself of the Almighty's approval for almost\nany goings-on. Dr. Orth had a merry twinkle in his eye and a dry humour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden had had two secret interviews with him in Yokohama and had\nlearnt that Professor Z., though eager to free his country from the\nAustrian rule and, since he knew that this could only come about by the\ndownfall of the Central Powers, with the Allies body and soul, yet had\nscruples; he would not do things that outraged his conscience, all must\nbe straightforward and above board, and so some things that it was\nnecessary to do had to be done without his knowledge. His influence was\nso great that his wishes could not be disregarded, but on occasion it\nwas felt better not to let him know too much of what was going on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Orth had arrived in Petrograd a week before Ashenden and now put\nbefore him what he had learned of the situation. It seemed to Ashenden\nthat it was critical and if anything was to be done it must be done\nquickly. The army was dissatisfied and mutinous, the Government under\nthe weak Kerensky was tottering and held power only because no one else\nhad the courage to seize it, famine was staring the country in the face\nand already the possibility had to be considered that the Germans would\nmarch on Petrograd. The Ambassadors of Great Britain and the United\nStates had been apprised of Ashenden's coming, but his mission was\nsecret even from them, and there were particular reasons why he could\ndemand no assistance from them. He arranged with Dr. Orth to make an\nappointment with Professor Z. so that he could learn his views and\nexplain to him that he had the financial means to support any scheme\nthat seemed likely to prevent the catastrophe that the Allied\ngovernments foresaw of Russia's making a separate peace. But he had to\nget in touch with influential persons in all classes. Mr. Harrington\nwith his business proposition and his letters to Ministers of State\nwould be thrown in contact with members of the Government and Mr.\nHarrington wanted an interpreter. Dr. Orth spoke Russian almost as well\nas his own language and it struck Ashenden that he would be admirably\nsuited to the post. He explained the circumstances to him and it was\narranged that while Ashenden and Mr. Harrington were at luncheon Dr.\nOrth should come in, greeting Ashenden as though he had not seen him\nbefore, and be introduced to Mr. Harrington; then Ashenden, guiding the\nconversation, would suggest to Mr. Harrington that the heavens had sent\nin Dr. Orth the ideal man for his purpose.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut there was another person on whom Ashenden had fixed as possibly\nuseful to him and now he said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you ever heard of a woman called Anastasia Alexandrovna Leonidov?\nShe's the daughter of Alexander Denisiev.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know all about him of course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have reason to believe she's in Petrograd. Will you find out where\nshe lives and what she's doing?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Certainly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Orth spoke in Czech to one of the two men who accompanied him. They\nwere sharp-looking fellows, both of them, one was tall and fair and the\nother was short and dark, but they were younger than Dr. Orth and\nAshenden understood that they were there to do as he bade them. The man\nnodded, got up, shook hands with Ashenden and went out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You shall have all the information possible this afternoon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I think there's nothing more we can do for the present,\" said\nAshenden. \"To tell you the truth I haven't had a bath for eleven days\nand I badly want one.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden had never quite made up his mind whether the pleasure of\nreflection was better pursued in a railway carriage or in a bath. So far\nas the act of invention was concerned he was inclined to prefer a train\nthat went smoothly and not too fast, and many of his best ideas had come\nto him when he was thus traversing the plains of France; but for the\ndelight of reminiscence or the entertainment of embroidery upon a theme\nalready in his head he had no doubt that nothing could compare with a\nhot bath. He considered now, wallowing in soapy water like a\nwater-buffalo in a muddy pond, the grim pleasantry of his relations with\nAnastasia Alexandrovna Leonidov.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn these stories no more than the barest suggestion has been made that\nAshenden was capable on occasions of the passion ironically called\ntender. The specialists in this matter, those charming creatures who\nmake a business of what philosophers know is but a diversion, assert\nthat writers, painters and musicians, all in short who are connected\nwith the arts, in the relation of love cut no very conspicuous figure.\nThere is much cry but little wool. They rave or sigh, make phrases and\nstrike many a romantic attitude, but in the end, loving art or\nthemselves (which with them is one and the same thing) better than the\nobject of their emotion, offer a shadow when the said object, with the\npractical common sense of the sex, demands a substance. It may be so and\nthis may be the reason (never before suggested) why women in their souls\nlook upon art with such a virulent hatred. Be this as it may Ashenden in\nthe last twenty years had felt his heart go pit-a-pat because of one\ncharming person after another. He had had a good deal of fun and had\npaid for it with a great deal of misery, but even when suffering most\nacutely from the pangs of unrequited love he had been able to say to\nhimself, albeit with a wry face, after all, it's grist to the mill.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnastasia Alexandrovna Leonidov was the daughter of a revolutionary who\nhad escaped from Siberia after being sentenced to penal servitude for\nlife and had settled in England. He was an able man and had supported\nhimself for thirty years by the activity of a restless pen and had even\nmade himself a distinguished position in English letters. When Anastasia\nAlexandrovna reached a suitable age she married Vladimir Semenovich\nLeonidov, also an exile from his native country, and it was after she\nhad been married to him for some years that Ashenden made her\nacquaintance. It was at the time when Europe discovered Russia. Everyone\nwas reading the Russian novelists, the Russian dancers captivated the\ncivilised world, and the Russian composers set shivering the sensibility\nof persons who were beginning to want a change from Wagner. Russian art\nseized upon Europe with the virulence of an epidemic of influenza. New\nphrases became the fashion, new colours, new emotions, and the highbrows\ndescribed themselves without a moment's hesitation as members of the\nintelligentsia. It was a difficult word to spell but an easy one to say.\nAshenden fell like the rest, changed the cushions of his sitting-room,\nhung an eikon on the wall, read Chekoff and went to the ballet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnastasia Alexandrovna was by birth, circumstances and education very\nmuch a member of the intelligentsia. She lived with her husband in a\ntiny house near Regent's Park and here all the literary folk in London\nmight gaze with humble reverence at pale-faced bearded giants who leaned\nagainst the wall like caryatids taking a day off; they were\nrevolutionaries to a man and it was a miracle that they were not in the\nmines of Siberia. Women of letters tremulously put their lips to a glass\nof vodka. If you were lucky and greatly favoured you might shake hands\nthere with Diaghileff, and now and again, like a peach-blossom wafted by\nthe breeze, Pavlova herself hovered in and out. At this time Ashenden's\nsuccess had not been so great as to affront the highbrows, he had very\ndistinctly been one of them in his youth, and though some already looked\naskance, others (optimistic creatures with a faith in human nature)\nstill had hopes of him. Anastasia Alexandrovna told him to his face that\nhe was a member of the intelligentsia. Ashenden was quite ready to\nbelieve it. He was in a state when he was ready to believe anything. He\nwas thrilled and excited. It seemed to him that at last he was about to\ncapture that illusive spirit of romance that he had so long been\nchasing. Anastasia Alexandrovna had fine eyes and a good, though for\nthese days too voluptuous, figure, high cheek-bones and a snub nose\n(this was very Tartar), a wide mouth full of large square teeth and a\npale skin. She dressed somewhat flamboyantly. In her dark melancholy\neyes Ashenden saw the boundless steppes of Russia, and the Kremlin with\nits pealing bells, and the solemn ceremonies of Easter at St. Isaac's,\nand forests of silver beeches and the Nevsky Prospekt; it was\nastonishing how much he saw in her eyes. They were round and shining and\nslightly protuberant like those of a Pekinese. They talked together of\nAlyosha in the <i>Brothers Karamazov</i>, of Natasha in <i>War and Peace</i>, of\nAnna Karenina and of <i>Fathers and Sons</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden soon discovered that her husband was quite unworthy of her and\npresently learned that she shared his opinion. Vladimir Semenovich was a\nlittle man with a large, long head that looked as though it had been\npulled like a piece of liquorice, and he had a great shock of unruly\nRussian hair. He was a gentle, unobtrusive creature and it was hard to\nbelieve that the Czarist government had really feared his revolutionary\nactivities. He taught Russian and wrote for papers in Moscow. He was\namiable and obliging. He needed these qualities, for Anastasia\nAlexandrovna was a woman of character: when she had a toothache Vladimir\nSemenovich suffered the agonies of the damned and when her heart was\nwrung by the suffering of her unhappy country Vladimir Semenovich might\nwell have wished he had never been born. Ashenden could not help\nadmitting that he was a poor thing, but he was so harmless that he\nconceived quite a liking for him, and when in due course he had\ndisclosed his passion to Anastasia Alexandrovna and to his joy found it\nwas returned he was puzzled to know what to do about Vladimir\nSemenovich. Neither Anastasia Alexandrovna nor he felt that they could\nlive another minute out of one another's pockets, and Ashenden feared\nthat, with her revolutionary views and all that, she would never consent\nto marry him; but somewhat to his surprise, and very much to his relief,\nshe accepted the suggestion with alacrity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would Vladimir Semenovich let himself be divorced, do you think?\" he\nasked, as he sat on the sofa, leaning against cushions the colour of\nwhich reminded him of raw meat just gone bad, and held her hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Vladimir adores me,\" she answered. \"It'll break his heart.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's a nice fellow, I shouldn't like him to be very unhappy. I hope\nhe'll get over it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He'll never get over it. That is the Russian spirit. I know that when I\nleave him he'll feel that he has lost everything that made life worth\nliving for him. I've never known anyone so wrapped up in a woman as he\nis in me. But of course he wouldn't want to stand in the way of my\nhappiness. He's far too great for that. He'll see that when it's a\nquestion of my own self-development I haven't the right to hesitate.\nVladimir will give me my freedom without question.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that time the divorce law in England was even more complicated and\nabsurd than it is now and in case she was not acquainted with its\npeculiarities Ashenden explained to Anastasia Alexandrovna the\ndifficulties of the case. She put her hand gently on his.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Vladimir would never expose me to the vulgar notoriety of the divorce\ncourt. When I tell him that I have decided to marry you he will commit\nsuicide.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That would be terrible,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was startled, but thrilled. It was really very much like a Russian\nnovel and he saw the moving and terrible pages, pages and pages, in\nwhich Dostoievsky would have described the situation. He knew the\nlacerations his characters would have suffered, the broken bottles of\nchampagne, the visits to the gipsies, the vodka, the swoonings, the\ncatalepsy and the long, long speeches everyone would have made. It was\nall very dreadful and wonderful and shattering.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would make us horribly unhappy,\" said Anastasia Alexandrovna, \"but I\ndon't know what else he could do. I couldn't ask him to live without me.\nHe would be like a ship without a rudder or a car without a carburettor.\nI know Vladimir so well. He will commit suicide.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How?\" asked Ashenden, who had the realist's passion for the exact\ndetail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He will blow his brains out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden remembered <i>Rosmersholm</i>. In his day he had been an ardent\nIbsenite and had even flirted with the notion of learning Norwegian so\nthat he might, by reading the master in the original, get at the secret\nessence of his thought. He had once seen Ibsen in the flesh drink a\nglass of Munich beer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But do you think we could ever pass another easy hour if we had the\ndeath of that man on our conscience?\" he asked. \"I have a feeling that\nhe would always be between us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know we shall suffer, we shall suffer dreadfully,\" said Anastasia\nAlexandrovna, \"but how can we help it? Life is like that. We must think\nof Vladimir. There is his happiness to be considered too. He will prefer\nto commit suicide.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe turned her face away and Ashenden saw that the heavy tears were\ncoursing down her cheeks. He was much moved. For he had a soft heart and\nit was dreadful to think of poor Vladimir lying there with a bullet in\nhis brain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThese Russians, what fun they have!\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut when Anastasia Alexandrovna had mastered her emotion she turned to\nhim gravely. She looked at him with her humid, round and slightly\nprotuberant eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We must be quite sure that we're doing the right thing,\" she said. \"I\nshould never forgive myself if I'd allowed Vladimir to commit suicide\nand then found I'd made a mistake. I think we ought to make sure that we\nreally love one another.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But don't you know?\" exclaimed Ashenden in a low, tense voice. \"I\nknow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let's go over to Paris for a week and see how we get on. Then we shall\nknow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was a trifle conventional and the suggestion took him by\nsurprise. But only for a moment. Anastasia was wonderful. She was very\nquick and she saw the hesitation that for an instant troubled him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Surely you have no bourgeois prejudices?\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course not,\" he assured her hurriedly, for he would much sooner have\nbeen thought knavish than bourgeois, \"I think it's a splendid idea.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why should a woman hazard her whole life on a throw? It's impossible to\nknow what a man is really like till you've lived with him. It's only\nfair to give her the opportunity to change her mind before it's too\nlate.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite so,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnastasia Alexandrovna was not a woman to let the grass grow under her\nfeet and so having made their arrangements forthwith on the following\nSaturday they started for Paris.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall not tell Vladimir that I am going with you,\" she said. \"It\nwould only distress him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be a pity to do that,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And if at the end of the week I come to the conclusion that we've made\na mistake he need never know anything about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite so,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey met at Victoria Station.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What class have you got?\" she asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"First.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm glad of that. Father and Vladimir travel third on account of their\nprinciples, but I always feel sick on a train and I like to be able to\nlean my head on somebody's shoulder. It's easier in a first-class\ncarriage.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen the train started Anastasia Alexandrovna said she felt dizzy, so\nshe took off her hat and leaned her head on Ashenden's shoulder. He put\nhis arm round her waist.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Keep quite still, won't you?\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen they got on to the boat she went down to the ladies' cabin and at\nCalais was able to eat a very hearty meal, but when they got into the\ntrain she took off her hat again and rested her head on Ashenden's\nshoulder. He thought he would like to read and took up a book.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mind not reading?\" she said. \"I have to be held and when you\nturn the pages it makes me feel all funny.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFinally they reached Paris and went to a little hotel on the Left Bank\nthat Anastasia Alexandrovna knew of. She said it had atmosphere. She\ncould not bear those great big grand hotels on the other side; they were\nhopelessly vulgar and bourgeois.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll go anywhere you like,\" said Ashenden, \"as long as there's a\nbathroom.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe smiled and pinched his cheek.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How adorably English you are. Can't you do without a bathroom for a\nweek? My dear, my dear, you have so much to learn.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey talked far into the night about Maxim Gorki and Karl Marx, human\ndestiny, love and the brotherhood of man; and drank innumerable cups of\nRussian tea, so that in the morning Ashenden would willingly have\nbreakfasted in bed and got up for luncheon; but Anastasia Alexandrovna\nwas an early riser. When life was so short and there was so much to do\nit was a sinful thing to have breakfast a minute after half-past eight.\nThey sat down in a dingy little dining-room the windows of which showed\nno signs of having been opened for a month. It was full of atmosphere.\nAshenden asked Anastasia Alexandrovna what she would have for breakfast.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Scrambled eggs,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe ate heartily. Ashenden had already noticed that she had a healthy\nappetite. He supposed it was a Russian trait: you could not picture Anna\nKarenina making her midday meal off a bath-bun and a cup of coffee,\ncould you?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter breakfast they went to the Louvre and in the afternoon they went\nto the Luxembourg. They dined early in order to go to the Comedie\nFrançaise; then they went to a Russian cabaret where they danced. When\nnext morning at eight-thirty they took their places in the dining-room\nand Ashenden asked Anastasia Alexandrovna what she fancied, her reply\nwas:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Scrambled eggs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But we had scrambled eggs yesterday,\" he expostulated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let's have them again to-day,\" she smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey spent the day in the same manner except that they went to the\nCarnavalet instead of the Louvre and the Musée Guimet instead of the\nLuxembourg. But when the morning after in answer to Ashenden's enquiry\nAnastasia Alexandrovna again asked for scrambled eggs, his heart sank.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But we had scrambled eggs yesterday and the day before,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you think that's a very good reason to have them again to-day?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I don't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it possible that your sense of humour is a little deficient this\nmorning?\" she asked. \"I eat scrambled eggs every day. It's the only way\nI like them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, very well. In that case of course we'll have scrambled eggs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the following morning he could not face them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you have scrambled eggs as usual?\" he asked her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course,\" she smiled affectionately, showing him two rows of large\nsquare teeth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right, I'll order them for you; I shall have mine fried.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe smile vanished from her lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh?\" She paused a moment. \"Don't you think that's rather inconsiderate?\nDo you think it's fair to give the cook unnecessary work? You English,\nyou're all the same, you look upon servants as machines. Does it occur\nto you that they have hearts like yours, the same feelings and the same\nemotions? How can you be surprised that the proletariat are seething\nwith discontent when the bourgeoisie like you are so monstrously\nselfish?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you really think that there'll be a revolution in England if I have\nmy eggs in Paris fried rather than scrambled?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe tossed her pretty head in indignation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't understand. It's the principle of the thing. You think it's a\njest, of course I know you're being funny, I can laugh at a joke as well\nas anyone, Chekoff was well-known in Russia as a humorist; but don't you\nsee what is involved? Your whole attitude is wrong. It's a lack of\nfeeling. You wouldn't talk like that if you had been through the events\nof 1905 in Petersburg. When I think of the crowds in front of the Winter\nPalace kneeling in the snow while the Cossacks charged them, women and\nchildren! No, no, no.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer eyes filled with tears and her face was all twisted with pain. She\ntook Ashenden's hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know you have a good heart. It was just thoughtless on your part and\nwe won't say anything more about it. You have imagination. You're very\nsensitive. I know. You'll have your eggs done in the same way as mine,\nwon't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe ate scrambled eggs for breakfast every morning after that. The waiter\nsaid: \"<i>Monsieur aime les oeufs brouillés.</i>\" At the end of the week they\nreturned to London. He held Anastasia Alexandrovna in his arms, her head\nresting on his shoulder, from Paris to Calais and again from Dover to\nLondon. He reflected that the journey from New York to San Francisco\ntook five days. When they arrived at Victoria and stood on the platform\nwaiting for a cab she looked at him with her round, shining and slightly\nprotuberant eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We've had a wonderful time, haven't we?\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wonderful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've quite made up my mind. The experiment has justified itself. I'm\nwilling to marry you whenever you like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Ashenden saw himself eating scrambled eggs every morning for the\nrest of his life. When he had put her in a cab, he called another for\nhimself, went to the Cunard office and took a berth on the first ship\nthat was going to America. No immigrant, eager for freedom and a new\nlife, ever looked upon the statue of Liberty with more heartfelt\nthankfulness than did Ashenden, when on that bright and sunny morning\nhis ship steamed into the harbour of New York.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSome years had passed since then and Ashenden had not seen Anastasia\nAlexandrovna again. He knew that on the outbreak of the revolution in\nMarch she and Vladimir Semenovich had gone to Russia. It might be that\nthey would be able to help him, in a way Vladimir Semenovich owed him\nhis life, and he made up his mind to write to Anastasia Alexandrovna to\nask if he might come to see her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ashenden went down to lunch he felt somewhat rested. Mr. Harrington\nwas waiting for him and they sat down. They ate what was put before\nthem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ask the waiter to bring us some bread,\" said Mr. Harrington.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bread?\" replied Ashenden. \"There's no bread.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't eat without bread,\" said Mr. Harrington.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid you'll have to. There's no bread, no butter, no sugar, no\neggs, no potatoes. There's fish and meat and green vegetables, and\nthat's all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington's jaw dropped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But this is war,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It looks very much like it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington was for a moment speechless; then he said: \"I'll tell you\nwhat I'm going to do, I'm going to get through with my business as quick\nas I can and then I'm going to get out of this country. I'm sure Mrs.\nHarrington wouldn't like me to go without sugar or butter. I've got a\nvery delicate stomach. The firm would never have sent me here if they'd\nthought I wasn't going to have the best of everything.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn a little while Dr. Egan Orth came in and gave Ashenden an envelope.\nOn it was written Anastasia Alexandrovna's address. He introduced him to\nMr. Harrington. It was soon clear that he was pleased with Dr. Egan Orth\nand so without further to-do he suggested that here was the perfect\ninterpreter for him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He talks Russian like a Russian. But he's an American citizen so that\nhe won't do you down. I've known him a considerable time and I can\nassure you that he's absolutely trustworthy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington was pleased with the notion and after luncheon Ashenden\nleft them to settle the matter by themselves. He wrote a note to\nAnastasia Alexandrovna and presently received an answer to say that she\nwas going to a meeting, but would look in at his hotel about seven. He\nawaited her with apprehension. Of course he knew now that he had not\nloved her, but Tolstoi and Dostoievsky, Rimsky-Korsakoff, Stravinsky and\nBakst; but he was not quite sure if the point had occurred to her. When\nbetween eight and half-past she arrived he suggested that she should\njoin Mr. Harrington and him at dinner. The presence of a third party, he\nthought, would prevent any awkwardness their meeting might have; but he\nneed not have had any anxiety, for five minutes after they had sat down\nto a plate of soup it was borne in upon him that the feelings of\nAnastasia Alexandrovna towards him were as cool as were his towards her.\nIt gave him a momentary shock. It is very hard for a man, however\nmodest, to grasp the possibility that a woman who has once loved him may\nlove him no longer, and though of course he did not imagine that\nAnastasia Alexandrovna had languished for five years with a hopeless\npassion for him, he did think that by a heightening of colour, a flutter\nof the eyelashes, or a quiver of the lips she would betray the fact that\nshe had still a soft place in her heart for him. Not at all. She talked\nto him as though he were a friend she was very glad to see again after\nan absence of a few days, but whose intimacy with her was purely social.\nHe asked after Vladimir Semenovich.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He has been a disappointment to me,\" she said. \"I never thought he was\na clever man, but I thought he was an honest one. He's going to have a\nbaby.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington who was about to put a piece of fish into his mouth,\nstopped, his fork in the air, and stared at Anastasia Alexandrovna with\nastonishment. In extenuation it must be explained that he had never read\na Russian novel in his life. Ashenden, slightly perplexed too, gave her\na questioning look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not the mother,\" she said with a laugh. \"I am not interested in\nthat sort of thing. The mother is a friend of mine and a well-known\nwriter on Political Economy. I do not think her views are sound, but I\nshould be the last to deny that they deserve consideration. She has a\ngood brain, quite a good brain.\" She turned to Mr. Harrington. \"Are you\ninterested in Political Economy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor once in his life Mr. Harrington was speechless. Anastasia\nAlexandrovna gave them her views on the subject and they began to speak\non the situation in Russia. She seemed to be on intimate terms with the\nleaders of the various political parties and Ashenden made up his mind\nto sound her on the possibility of her working with him. His infatuation\nhad not blinded him to the fact that she was an extremely intelligent\nwoman. After dinner he told Mr. Harrington that he wished to talk\nbusiness with Anastasia Alexandrovna and took her to a retired corner of\nthe lounge. He told her all he thought necessary and found her\ninterested and anxious to help. She had a passion for intrigue and a\ndesire for power. When he hinted that he had command of large sums of\nmoney she saw at once that through him she might acquire an influence in\nthe affairs of Russia. It tickled her vanity. She was immensely\npatriotic, but like many patriots she had an impression that her own\naggrandisement tended to the good of her country. When they parted they\nhad come to a working agreement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That was a very remarkable woman,\" said Mr. Harrington next morning\nwhen they met at breakfast.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't fall in love with her,\" smiled Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis, however, was not a matter on which Mr. Harrington was prepared to\njest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have never looked at a woman since I married Mrs. Harrington,\" he\nsaid. \"That husband of hers must be a bad man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I could do with a plate of scrambled eggs,\" said Ashenden,\nirrelevantly, for their breakfast consisted of a cup of tea without milk\nand a little jam instead of sugar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith Anastasia Alexandrovna to help him and Dr. Orth in the background,\nAshenden set to work. Things in Russia were going from bad to worse.\nKerensky, the head of the Provisional Government, was devoured by vanity\nand dismissed any minister who gave evidence of a capacity that might\nendanger his own position. He made speeches. He made endless speeches.\nAt one moment there was a possibility that the Germans would make a dash\nfor Petrograd. Kerensky made speeches. The food shortage grew more\nserious, the winter was approaching and there was no fuel. Kerensky made\nspeeches. In the background the Bolsheviks were active, Lenin was hiding\nin Petrograd, it was said that Kerensky knew where he was, but dared not\narrest him. He made speeches.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt amused Ashenden to see the unconcern with which Mr. Harrington\nwandered through this turmoil. History was in the making and Mr.\nHarrington minded his own business. It was uphill work. He was made to\npay bribes to secretaries and underlings under the pretence that the ear\nof great men would be granted to him. He was kept waiting for hours in\nantechambers and then sent away without ceremony. When at last he saw\nthe great men he found they had nothing to give him but idle words. They\nmade him promises and in a day or two he discovered that the promises\nmeant nothing. Ashenden advised him to throw in his hand and return to\nAmerica; but Mr. Harrington would not hear of it; his firm had sent him\nto do a particular job, and by gum, he was going to do it or perish in\nthe attempt. Then Anastasia Alexandrovna took him in hand. A singular\nfriendship had arisen between the pair. Mr. Harrington thought her a\nvery remarkable and deeply wronged woman; he told her all about his wife\nand his two sons, he told her all about the Constitution of the United\nStates; she on her side told him all about Vladimir Semenovich, and she\ntold him about Tolstoi, Turgenev and Dostoievsky. They had great times\ntogether. He said he couldn't manage to call her Anastasia Alexandrovna,\nit was too much of a mouthful; so he called her Delilah. And now she\nplaced her inexhaustible energy at his service and they went together to\nthe persons who might be useful to him. But things were coming to a\nhead. Riots broke out and the streets were growing dangerous. Now and\nthen armoured cars filled with discontented reservists careered wildly\nalong the Nevsky Prospekt and in order to show that they were not happy\ntook pot-shots at the passers-by. On one occasion when Mr. Harrington\nand Anastasia Alexandrovna were in a tram together shots peppered the\nwindows and they had to lie down on the floor for safety. Mr. Harrington\nwas highly indignant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"An old fat woman was lying right on top of me and when I wriggled to\nget out Delilah caught me a clip on the side of the head and said: Stop\nstill, you fool. I don't like your Russian ways, Delilah.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Anyhow you stopped still,\" she giggled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What you want in this country is a little less art and a little more\ncivilisation.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are bourgeoisie, Mr. Harrington, you are not a member of the\nintelligentsia.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are the first person who's ever said that, Delilah. If I'm not a\nmember of the intelligentsia I don't know who is,\" retorted Mr.\nHarrington with dignity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen one day when Ashenden was working in his room there was a knock at\nthe door and Anastasia Alexandrovna stalked in followed somewhat\nsheepishly, by Mr. Harrington. Ashenden saw that she was excited.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's the matter?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Unless this man goes back to America he'll get killed. You really must\ntalk to him. If I hadn't been there something very unpleasant might have\nhappened to him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not at all, Delilah,\" said Mr. Harrington, with asperity. \"I'm\nperfectly capable of taking care of myself and I wasn't in the smallest\ndanger.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it all about?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd taken Mr. Harrington to the Lavra of Alexander Nevsky to see\nDostoievsky's grave,\" said Anastasia Alexandrovna, \"and on our way back\nwe saw a soldier being rather rough with an old woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Rather rough!\" cried Mr. Harrington. \"There was an old woman walking\nalong the pavement with a basket of provisions on her arm. Two soldiers\ncame up behind her and one of them snatched the basket from her and\nwalked off with it. She burst out screaming and crying, I don't know\nwhat she was saying, but I can guess, and the other soldier took his gun\nand with the butt-end of it hit her over the head. Isn't that right,\nDelilah?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes,\" she answered, unable to help smiling. \"And before I could prevent\nit Mr. Harrington jumped out of the cab and ran up to the soldier who\nhad the basket, wrenched it from him and began to abuse the pair of them\nlike pickpockets. At first they were so taken aback they didn't know\nwhat to do and then they got in a rage. I ran after Mr. Harrington and\nexplained to them that he was a foreigner and drunk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Drunk?\" cried Mr. Harrington.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, drunk. Of course a crowd collected. It looked as though it wasn't\ngoing to be very nice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington smiled with those large, pale-blue eyes of his.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It sounded to me as though you were giving them a piece of your mind,\nDelilah. It was as good as a play to watch you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be stupid, Mr. Harrington,\" cried Anastasia, in a sudden fury,\nstamping her foot. \"Don't you know that those soldiers might very easily\nhave killed you and me too, and not one of the bystanders would have\nraised a finger to help us?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Me? I'm an American citizen, Delilah. They wouldn't dare touch a hair\nof my head.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They'd have difficulty in finding one,\" said Anastasia Alexandrovna,\nwho when she was in a temper had no manners. \"But if you think Russian\nsoldiers are going to hesitate to kill you because you're an American\ncitizen you'll get a big surprise one of these days.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what happened to the old woman?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The soldiers went off after a little and we went back to her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Still with the basket?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. Mr. Harrington clung on to that like grim death. She was lying on\nthe ground with the blood pouring from her head. We got her into the cab\nand when she could speak enough to tell us where she lived we drove her\nhome. She was bleeding dreadfully and we had some difficulty in\nstaunching the blood.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnastasia Alexandrovna gave Mr. Harrington an odd look and to his\nsurprise Ashenden saw him turn scarlet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's the matter now?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see, we had nothing to bind her up with. Mr. Harrington's\nhandkerchief was soaked. There was only one thing about me that I could\nget off quickly and so I took off my...\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut before she could finish Mr. Harrington interrupted her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You need not tell Mr. Ashenden what you took off. I'm a married man and\nI know ladies wear them, but I see no need to refer to them in general\nsociety.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnastasia Alexandrovna giggled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then you must kiss me, Mr. Harrington. If you don't I shall say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington hesitated a moment, considering evidently the pros and\ncons of the matter, but he saw that Anastasia Alexandrovna was\ndetermined.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go on then, you may kiss me, Delilah, though I'm bound to say I don't\nsee what pleasure it can be to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe put her arms round his neck and kissed him on both cheeks, then\nwithout a word of warning burst into a flood of tears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're a brave little man, Mr. Harrington. You're absurd but\nmagnificent,\" she sobbed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington was less surprised than Ashenden would have expected him\nto be. He looked at Anastasia with a thin, quizzical smile and gently\npatted her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come, come, Delilah, pull yourself together. It gave you a nasty turn,\ndidn't it? You're quite upset. I shall have terrible rheumatism in my\nshoulder if you go on weeping all over it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe scene was ridiculous and touching. Ashenden laughed, but he had the\nbeginnings of a lump in his throat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Anastasia Alexandrovna had left them Mr. Harrington sat in a brown\nstudy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're very queer, these Russians. Do you know what Delilah did?\" he\nsaid, suddenly. \"She stood up in the cab, in the middle of the street,\nwith people passing on both sides, and took her pants off. She tore them\nin two and gave me one to hold while she made a bandage of the other. I\nwas never so embarrassed in my life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell me what gave you the idea of calling her Delilah?\" smiled\nAshenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington reddened a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's a very fascinating woman, Mr. Ashenden. She's been deeply wronged\nby her husband and I naturally felt a great deal of sympathy for her.\nThese Russians are very emotional people and I did not want her to\nmistake my sympathy for anything else. I told her I was very much\nattached to Mrs. Harrington.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not under the impression that Delilah was Potiphar's wife?\"\nasked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what you mean by that, Mr. Ashenden,\" replied Mr.\nHarrington. \"Mrs. Harrington has always given me to understand that I'm\nvery fascinating to women, and I thought if I called our little friend\nDelilah it would make my position quite clear.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think Russia's any place for you, Mr. Harrington,\" said\nAshenden smiling. \"If I were you I'd get out of it as quick as I could.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't go now. I've got them to agree to my terms at last and we're\ngoing to sign next week. Then I shall pack my grip and go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder if your signatures will be worth the paper they're written\non,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had at length devised a plan of campaign. It took him twenty-four\nhours' hard work to code a telegram in which he put his scheme before\nthe persons who had sent him to Petrograd. It was accepted and he was\npromised all the money he needed. Ashenden knew he could do nothing\nunless the Provisional Government remained in power for another three\nmonths; but winter was at hand and food was getting scarcer every day.\nThe army was mutinous. The people clamoured for peace. Every evening at\nthe Europe Ashenden drank a cup of chocolate with Professor Z. and\ndiscussed with him how best to make use of his devoted Czechs. Anastasia\nAlexandrovna had a flat in a retired spot and here he had meetings with\nall manner of persons. Plans were drawn up. Measures were taken.\nAshenden argued, persuaded, promised. He had to overcome the vacillation\nof one and wrestle with the fatalism of another. He had to judge who was\nresolute and who was self-sufficient, who was honest and who was infirm\nof purpose. He had to curb his impatience with the Russian verbosity; he\nhad to be good-tempered with people who were willing to talk of\neverything but the matter in hand; he had to listen sympathetically to\nranting and rhodomontade. He had to beware of treachery. He had to\nhumour the vanity of fools and elude the greed of the ambitious. Time\nwas pressing. The rumours grew hot and many of the activities of the\nBolsheviks. Kerensky ran hither and thither like a frightened hen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen the blow fell. On the night of November 7th, 1917, the Bolsheviks\nrose, Kerensky's ministers were arrested and the Winter Palace was\nsacked by the mob; the reins of power were seized by Lenin and Trotsky.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnastasia Alexandrovna came to Ashenden's room at the hotel early in the\nmorning. Ashenden was coding a telegram. He had been up all night, first\nat the Smolny, and then at the Winter Palace. He was tired out. Her face\nwas white and her shining brown eyes were tragic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you heard?\" she asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe nodded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's all over then. They say Kerensky has fled. They never even showed\nfight.\" Rage seized her. \"The buffoon!\" she screamed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment there was a knock at the door and Anastasia Alexandrovna\nlooked at it with sudden apprehension.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know the Bolsheviks have got a list of people they've decided to\nexecute. My name is on it, and it may be that yours is too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If it's they and they want to come in they only have to turn the\nhandle,\" said Ashenden, smiling, but with ever so slightly odd a feeling\nat the pit of his stomach. \"Come in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe door was opened and Mr. Harrington stepped into the room. He was as\ndapper as ever, in his short black coat and striped trousers, his shoes\nneatly polished and a derby on his bald head. He took it off when he saw\nAnastasia Alexandrovna.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, fancy finding you here so early. I looked in on my way out, I\nwanted to tell you my news. I tried to find you yesterday evening, but\ncouldn't. You didn't come in to dinner.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I was at a meeting,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must both congratulate me, I got my signatures yesterday, and my\nbusiness is done.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington beamed on them, the picture of self-satisfaction, and he\narched himself like a bantam-cock who has chased away all rivals.\nAnastasia Alexandrovna burst into a sudden shriek of hysterical\nlaughter. He stared at her in perplexity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, Delilah, what is the matter?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnastasia laughed till the tears ran from her eyes and then began to sob\nin earnest. Ashenden explained.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Bolsheviks have overthrown the Government. Kerensky's ministers are\nin prison. The Bolsheviks are out to kill. Delilah says her name is on\nthe list. Your minister signed your documents yesterday because he knew\nit did not matter what he did then. Your contracts are worth nothing.\nThe Bolsheviks are going to make peace with Germany as soon as they\ncan.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnastasia Alexandrovna had recovered her self-control as quickly as she\nhad lost it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You had better get out of Russia as soon as you can, Mr. Harrington.\nIt's no place for a foreigner now and it may be that in a few days you\nwon't be able to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington looked from one to the other.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"O my,\" he said. \"O my!\" It seemed inadequate. \"Are you going to tell me\nthat that Russian minister was just making a fool of me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden shrugged his shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How can one tell what he was thinking of? He may have a keen sense of\nhumour and perhaps he thought it funny to sign a fifty-million-dollar\ncontract yesterday when there was every chance of his being stood\nagainst the wall and shot to-day. Anastasia Alexandrovna's right, Mr.\nHarrington, you'd better take the first train that'll get you to\nSweden.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what about you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's nothing for me to do here any more. I'm cabling for\ninstructions and I shall go as soon as I get leave. The Bolsheviks have\ngot ahead of us and the people I was working with will have their work\ncut out to save their lives.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Boris Petrovich was shot this morning,\" said Anastasia Alexandrovna\nwith a frown.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey both looked at Mr. Harrington and he stared at the floor. His pride\nin this achievement of his was shattered and he sagged like a pricked\nballoon. But in a minute he looked up. He gave Anastasia Alexandrovna a\nlittle smile and for the first time Ashenden noticed how attractive and\nkindly his smile was. There was something peculiarly disarming about it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If the Bolsheviks are after you, Delilah, don't you think you'd better\ncome with me? I'll take care of you and if you like to come to America\nI'm sure Mrs. Harrington would be glad to do anything she could for\nyou.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can see Mrs. Harrington's face if you arrived in Philadelphia with a\nRussian refugee,\" laughed Anastasia Alexandrovna. \"I'm afraid it would\nneed more explaining than you could ever manage. No, I shall stay here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But if you're in danger?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm a Russian. My place is here. I will not leave my country when most\nmy country needs me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is bunk, Delilah,\" said Mr. Harrington very quietly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnastasia Alexandrovna had spoken with deep emotion, but now with a\nlittle start she shot a sudden quizzical look at him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know it is, Samson,\" she answered. \"To tell you the truth I think\nwe're all going to have a hell of a time, God knows what's going to\nhappen, but I want to see; I wouldn't miss a minute of it for the\nworld.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington shook his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Curiosity is the bane of your sex, Delilah,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go along and do your packing, Mr. Harrington,\" said Ashenden, smiling,\n\"and then we'll take you to the station. The train will be besieged.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well, I'll go. And I shan't be sorry either. I haven't had a\ndecent meal since I came here and I've done a thing I never thought I\nshould have to do in my life, I've drunk my coffee without sugar and\nwhen I've been lucky enough to get a little piece of black bread I've\nhad to eat it without butter. Mrs. Harrington will never believe me when\nI tell her what I've gone through. What this country wants is\norganisation.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen he left them Ashenden and Anastasia Alexandrovna talked over the\nsituation. Ashenden was depressed because all his careful schemes had\ncome to nothing, but Anastasia Alexandrovna was excited and she hazarded\nevery sort of guess about the outcome of this new revolution. She\npretended to be very serious, but in her heart she looked upon it all\nvery much as a thrilling play. She wanted more and more things to\nhappen. Then there was another knock at the door and before Ashenden\ncould answer Mr. Harrington burst in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Really the service at this hotel is a scandal,\" he cried heatedly,\n\"I've been ringing my bell for fifteen minutes and I can't get anyone to\npay the smallest attention to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Service?\" exclaimed Anastasia Alexandrovna. \"There is not a servant\nleft in the hotel.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I want my laundry. They promised to let me have it back last\nnight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid you haven't got much chance of getting it now,\" said\nAshenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not going to leave without my laundry. Four shirts, two union\nsuits, a pair of pyjamas, and four collars. I wash my handkerchiefs and\nsocks in my room. I want my laundry and I'm not going to leave this\nhotel without it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be a fool,\" cried Ashenden. \"What you've got to do is to get out\nof here while the going's good. If there are no servants to get it\nyou'll just have to leave your washing behind you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pardon me, sir, I shall do nothing of the kind. I'll go and fetch it\nmyself. I've suffered enough at the hands of this country and I'm not\ngoing to leave four perfectly good shirts to be worn by a lot of dirty\nBolsheviks. No, sir. I do not leave Russia till I have my laundry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnastasia Alexandrovna stared at the floor for a moment; then with a\nlittle smile looked up. It seemed to Ashenden that there was something\nin her that responded to Mr. Harrington's futile obstinacy. In her\nRussian way she understood that Mr. Harrington could not leave Petrograd\nwithout his washing. His insistence had given it the value of a symbol.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll go downstairs and see if I can find anybody about who knows where\nthe laundry is, and if I can I'll go with you and you can bring your\nwashing away with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington unbent. He answered with that sweet and disarming smile\nof his.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's terribly kind of you, Delilah. I don't mind if it's ready or\nnot, I'll take it just as it is.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnastasia Alexandrovna left them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what do you think of Russia and the Russians now?\" Mr. Harrington\nasked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm fed up with them. I'm fed up with Tolstoi, I'm fed up with Turgenev\nand Dostoievski, I'm fed up with Chekoff. I'm fed up with the\nIntelligentsia. I hanker after people who know their mind from one\nminute to another, who mean what they say an hour after they've said it,\nwhose word you can rely on; I'm sick of fine phrases, and oratory and\nattitudinising.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden, bitten by the prevailing ill, was about to make a speech when\nhe was interrupted by a rattle as of peas on a drum. In the city, so\nstrangely silent, it sounded abrupt and odd.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's that?\" asked Mr. Harrington.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Rifle-firing. On the other side of the river, I should think.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Harrington gave a funny little look. He laughed, but his face was a\ntrifle pale; he did not like it, and Ashenden did not blame him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think it's high time I got out. I shouldn't so much mind for myself,\nbut I've got a wife and children to think of. I haven't had a letter\nfrom Mrs. Harrington for so long I'm a bit worried.\" He paused an\ninstant. \"I'd like you to know Mrs. Harrington, she's a very wonderful\nwoman. She's the best wife a man ever had. Until I came here I'd not\nbeen separated from her for more than three days since we were married.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnastasia Alexandrovna came back and told them that she had found the\naddress.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's about forty minutes' walk from here and if you'll come now I'll go\nwith you,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm ready.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd better look out,\" said Ashenden. \"I don't believe the streets are\nvery healthy to-day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnastasia Alexandrovna looked at Mr. Harrington.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must have my laundry, Delilah,\" he said. \"I should never rest in\npeace if I left it behind me and Mrs. Harrington would never let me hear\nthe last of it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come on then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey set out and Ashenden went on with the dreary business of\ntranslating into a very complicated code the shattering news he had to\ngive. It was a long message, and then he had to ask for instructions\nupon his own movements. It was a mechanical job and yet it was one in\nwhich you could not allow your attention to wander. The mistake of a\nsingle figure might make a whole sentence incomprehensible.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSuddenly his door was burst open and Anastasia Alexandrovna flung into\nthe room. She had lost her hat and was dishevelled. She was panting. Her\neyes were starting out of her head and she was obviously in a state of\ngreat excitement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where's Mr. Harrington?\" she cried. \"Isn't he here?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is he in his bedroom?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. Why, what's the matter? We'll go and look if you like.\nWhy didn't you bring him along with you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey walked down the passage and knocked at Mr. Harrington's door; there\nwas no answer; they tried the handle; the door was locked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's not there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey went back to Ashenden's room. Anastasia Alexandrovna sank into a\nchair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give me a glass of water, will you? I'm out of breath. I've been\nrunning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe drank the water Ashenden poured out for her. She gave a sudden sob.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope he's all right. I should never forgive myself if he was hurt. I\nwas hoping he would have got here before me. He got his washing all\nright. We found the place. There was only an old woman there and they\ndidn't want to let us take it, but we insisted. Mr. Harrington was\nfurious because it hadn't been touched. It was exactly as he had sent\nit. They'd promised it last night and it was still in the bundle that\nMr. Harrington had made himself. I said that was Russia and Mr.\nHarrington said he preferred coloured people. I'd led him by side\nstreets because I thought it was better, and we started to come back\nagain. We passed at the top of a street and at the bottom of it I saw a\nlittle crowd. There was a man addressing them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Let's go and hear what's he's saying,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I could see they were arguing. It looked exciting. I wanted to know\nwhat was happening.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Come along, Delilah,' he said. 'Let us mind our own business.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You go back to the hotel and do your packing. I'm going to see the\nfun,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I ran down the street and he followed me. There were about two or three\nhundred people there and a student was addressing them. There were some\nworking-men and they were shouting at him. I love a row and I edged my\nway into the crowd. Suddenly we heard the sound of shots and before you\ncould realise what was happening two armoured cars came dashing down the\nstreet. There were soldiers in them and they were firing as they went. I\ndon't know why. For fun, I suppose, or because they were drunk. We all\nscattered like a lot of rabbits. We just ran for our lives. I lost Mr.\nHarrington. I can't make out why he isn't here. Do you think something\nhas happened to him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was silent for a while.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'd better go out and look for him,\" he said. \"I don't know why the\ndevil he couldn't leave his washing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I understand, I understand so well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's a comfort,\" said Ashenden irritably. \"Let's go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put on his hat and coat, and they walked downstairs. The hotel seemed\nstrangely empty. They went out into the street. There was hardly anyone\nto be seen. They walked along. The trams were not running and the\nsilence in the great city was uncanny. The shops were closed. It was\nquite startling when a motor-car dashed by at breakneck speed. The\npeople they passed looked frightened and downcast. When they had to go\nthrough a main thoroughfare they hastened their steps. A lot of people\nwere there and they stood about irresolutely as though they did not know\nwhat to do next. Reservists in their shabby grey were walking down the\nmiddle of the roadway in little bunches. They did not speak. They looked\nlike sheep looking for their shepherd. Then they came to the street down\nwhich Anastasia Alexandrovna had run, but they entered it from the\nopposite end. A number of windows had been broken by the wild shooting.\nIt was quite empty. You could see where the people had scattered, for\nstrewn about were articles they had dropped in their haste, books, a\nman's hat, a lady's bag and a basket. Anastasia Alexandrovna touched\nAshenden's arm to draw his attention: sitting on the pavement, her head\nbent right down to her lap, was a woman and she was dead. A little way\non two men had fallen together. They were dead too. The wounded, one\nsupposed, had managed to drag themselves away or their friends had\ncarried them. Then they found Mr. Harrington. His derby had rolled in\nthe gutter. He lay on his face, in a pool of blood, his bald head, with\nits prominent bones, very white; his neat black coat smeared and muddy.\nBut his hand was clenched tight on the parcel that contained four\nshirts, two union suits, a pair of pyjamas and four collars. Mr.\nHarrington had not let his washing go.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nDr. Audlin looked at the clock on his desk. It was twenty minutes to\nsix. He was surprised that his patient was late, for Lord Mountdrago\nprided himself on his punctuality; he had a sententious way of\nexpressing himself which gave the air of an epigram to a commonplace\nremark, and he was in the habit of saying that punctuality is a\ncompliment you pay to the intelligent and a rebuke you administer to the\nstupid. Lord Mountdrago's appointment was for five-thirty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was in Dr. Audlin's appearance nothing to attract attention. He\nwas tall and spare, with narrow shoulders and something of a stoop; his\nhair was grey and thin; his long, sallow face deeply lined. He was not\nmore than fifty, but he looked older. His eyes, pale-blue and rather\nlarge, were weary. When you had been with him for a while you noticed\nthat they moved very little; they remained fixed on your face, but so\nempty of expression were they that it was no discomfort. They seldom lit\nup. They gave no clue to his thoughts nor changed with the words he\nspoke. If you were of an observant turn it might have struck you that he\nblinked much less often than most of us. His hands were on the large\nside, with long, tapering fingers; they were soft, but firm, cool but\nnot clammy. You could never have said what Dr. Audlin wore unless you\nhad made a point of looking. His clothes were dark. His tie was black.\nHis dress made his sallow lined face paler, and his pale eyes more wan.\nHe gave you the impression of a very sick man.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Audlin was a psycho-analyst. He had adopted the profession by\naccident and practised it with misgiving. When the war broke out he had\nnot been long qualified and was getting experience at various hospitals;\nhe offered his services to the authorities, and after a time was sent\nout to France. It was then that he discovered his singular gift. He\ncould allay certain pains by the touch of his cool, firm hands, and by\ntalking to them often induce sleep in men who were suffering from\nsleeplessness. He spoke slowly. His voice had no particular colour, and\nits tone did not alter with the words he uttered, but it was musical,\nsoft and lulling. He told the men that they must rest, that they mustn't\nworry, that they must sleep; and rest stole into their jaded bones,\ntranquillity pushed their anxieties away, like a man finding a place for\nhimself on a crowded bench, and slumber fell on their tired eyelids like\nthe light rain of spring upon the fresh-turned earth. Dr. Audlin found\nthat by speaking to men with that low, monotonous voice of his, by\nlooking at them with his pale, quiet eyes, by stroking their weary\nforeheads with his long firm hands, he could soothe their perturbations,\nresolve the conflicts that distracted them and banish the phobias that\nmade their lives a torment. Sometimes he effected cures that seemed\nmiraculous. He restored speech to a man who, after being buried under\nthe earth by a bursting shell, had been struck dumb, and he gave back\nthe use of his limbs to another who had been paralysed after a crash in\na plane. He could not understand his powers; he was of a sceptical turn,\nand though they say that in circumstances of this kind the first thing\nis to believe in yourself, he never quite succeeded in doing that; and\nit was only the outcome of his activities, patent to the most\nincredulous observer, that obliged him to admit that he had some\nfaculty, coming from he knew not where, obscure and uncertain, that\nenabled him to do things for which he could offer no explanation. When\nthe war was over he went to Vienna and studied there, and afterwards to\nZürich; and then settled down in London to practise the art he had so\nstrangely acquired. He had been practising now for fifteen years, and\nhad attained, in the speciality he followed, a distinguished reputation.\nPeople told one another of the amazing things he had done, and though\nhis fees were high, he had as many patients as he had time to see. Dr.\nAudlin knew that he had achieved some very extraordinary results; he had\nsaved men from suicide, others from the lunatic asylum, he had assuaged\ngriefs that embittered useful lives, he had turned unhappy marriages\ninto happy ones, he had eradicated abnormal instincts and thus delivered\nnot a few from a hateful bondage, he had given health to the sick in\nspirit; he had done all this, and yet at the back of his mind remained\nthe suspicion that he was little more than a quack.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt went against his grain to exercise a power that he could not\nunderstand, and it offended his honesty to trade on the faith of the\npeople he treated when he had no faith in himself. He was rich enough\nnow to live without working, and the work exhausted him; a dozen times\nhe had been on the point of giving up practice. He knew all that Freud\nand Jung and the rest of them had written. He was not satisfied; he had\nan intimate conviction that all their theory was hocus-pocus, and yet\nthere the results were, incomprehensible, but manifest. And what had he\nnot seen of human nature during the fifteen years that patients had been\ncoming to his dingy back-room in Wimpole Street? The revelations that\nhad been poured into his ears, sometimes only too willingly, sometimes\nwith shame, with reservations, with anger, had long ceased to surprise\nhim. Nothing could shock him any longer. He knew by now that men were\nliars, he knew how extravagant was their vanity; he knew far worse than\nthat about them; but he knew that it was not for him to judge or to\ncondemn. But year by year as these terrible confidences were imparted to\nhim his face grew a little greyer, its lines a little more marked and\nhis pale eyes more weary. He seldom laughed, but now and again when for\nrelaxation he read a novel he smiled. Did their authors really think the\nmen and women they wrote of were like that? If they only knew how much\nmore complicated they were, how much more unexpected, what\nirreconcilable elements co-existed within their souls and what dark and\nsinister contentions afflicted them!\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a quarter to six. Of all the strange cases he had been called\nupon to deal with Dr. Audlin could remember none stranger than that of\nLord Mountdrago. For one thing the personality of his patient made it\nsingular. Lord Mountdrago was an able and a distinguished man. Appointed\nSecretary for Foreign Affairs when still under forty, now after three\nyears in office he had seen his policy prevail. It was generally\nacknowledged that he was the ablest politician in the Conservative Party\nand only the fact that his father was a peer, on whose death he would no\nlonger be able to sit in the House of Commons, made it impossible for\nhim to aim at the premiership. But if in these democratic times it is\nout of the question for a Prime Minister of England to be in the House\nof Lords, there was nothing to prevent Lord Mountdrago from continuing\nto be Secretary for Foreign Affairs in successive Conservative\nadministrations and so for long directing the foreign policy of his\ncountry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLord Mountdrago had many good qualities. He had intelligence and\nindustry. He was widely travelled, and spoke several languages fluently.\nFrom early youth he had specialised in foreign affairs, and had\nconscientiously made himself acquainted with the political and economic\ncircumstances of other countries. He had courage, insight and\ndetermination. He was a good speaker, both on the platform and in the\nHouse, clear, precise and often witty. He was a brilliant debater and\nhis gift of repartee was celebrated. He had a fine presence: he was a\ntall, handsome man, rather bald and somewhat too stout, but this gave\nhim solidity and an air of maturity that were of service to him. As a\nyoung man he had been something of an athlete and had rowed in the\nOxford boat, and he was known to be one of the best shots in England. At\ntwenty-four he had married a girl of eighteen whose father was a duke\nand her mother a great American heiress, so that she had both position\nand wealth, and by her he had had two sons. For several years they had\nlived privately apart, but in public united, so that appearances were\nsaved, and no other attachment on either side had given the gossips\noccasion to whisper. Lord Mountdrago indeed was too ambitious, too\nhard-working, and it must be added too patriotic, to be tempted by any\npleasures that might interfere with his career. He had, in short, a\ngreat deal to make him a popular and successful figure. He had\nunfortunately great defects.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was a fearful snob. You would not have been surprised at this if his\nfather had been the first holder of the title. That the son of an\nennobled lawyer, a manufacturer or a distiller should attach an\ninordinate importance to his rank is understandable. The earldom held by\nLord Mountdrago's father was created by Charles II, and the barony held\nby the first Earl dated from the Wars of the Roses. For three hundred\nyears the successive holders of the title had allied themselves with the\nnoblest families of England. But Lord Mountdrago was as conscious of his\nbirth as a <i>nouveau riche</i> is conscious of his money. He never missed an\nopportunity of impressing it upon others. He had beautiful manners when\nhe chose to display them, but this he did only with people whom he\nregarded as his equals. He was coldly insolent to those whom he looked\nupon as his social inferiors. He was rude to his servants and insulting\nto his secretaries. The subordinate officials in the government offices\nto which he had been successively attached feared and hated him. His\narrogance was horrible. He knew that he was a great deal cleverer than\nmost of the persons he had to do with, and never hesitated to apprise\nthem of the fact. He had no patience with the infirmities of human\nnature. He felt himself born to command and was irritated with people\nwho expected him to listen to their arguments or wished to hear the\nreasons for his decisions. He was immeasurably selfish. He looked upon\nany service that was rendered him as a right due to his rank and\nintelligence and therefore deserving of no gratitude. It never entered\nhis head that he was called upon to do anything for others. He had many\nenemies: he despised them. He knew no one who merited his assistance,\nhis sympathy or his compassion. He had no friends. He was distrusted by\nhis chiefs, because they doubted his loyalty; he was unpopular with his\nparty, because he was overbearing and discourteous; and yet his merit\nwas so great, his patriotism so evident, his intelligence so solid and\nhis management of affairs so brilliant that they had to put up with him.\nAnd what made it possible to do this was that on occasion he could be\nenchanting: when he was with persons whom he considered his equals, or\nwhom he wished to captivate, in the company of foreign dignitaries or\nwomen of distinction, he could be gay, witty and debonair; his manners\nthen reminded you that in his veins ran the same blood as had run in the\nveins of Lord Chesterfield; he could tell a story with point, he could\nbe natural, sensible and even profound. You were surprised at the extent\nof his knowledge and the sensitiveness of his taste. You thought him the\nbest company in the world; you forgot that he had insulted you the day\nbefore and was quite capable of cutting you dead the next.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLord Mountdrago almost failed to become Dr. Audlin's patient. A\nsecretary rang up the doctor and told him that his lordship, wishing to\nconsult him, would be glad if he would come to his house at ten o'clock\non the following morning. Dr. Audlin answered that he was unable to go\nto Lord Mountdrago's house, but would be pleased to give him an\nappointment at his consulting-room at five o'clock on the next day but\none. The secretary took the message and presently rang back to say that\nLord Mountdrago insisted on seeing Dr. Audlin in his own house and the\ndoctor could fix his own fee. Dr. Audlin replied that he only saw\npatients in his consulting-room and expressed his regret that unless\nLord Mountdrago was prepared to come to him he could not give him his\nattention. In a quarter of an hour a brief message was delivered to him\nthat his lordship would come not next day but one, but next day, at\nfive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Lord Mountdrago was then shown in he did not come forward, but\nstood at the door and insolently looked the doctor up and down. Dr.\nAudlin perceived that he was in a rage; he gazed at him, silently, with\nstill eyes. He saw a big heavy man, with greying hair, receding on the\nforehead so that it gave nobility to his brow, a puffy face with bold\nregular features and an expression of haughtiness. He had somewhat the\nlook of one of the Bourbon sovereigns of the eighteenth century.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It seems that it is as difficult to see you as a Prime Minister, Dr.\nAudlin. I'm an extremely busy man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Won't you sit down?\" said the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis face showed no sign that Lord Mountdrago's speech in any way\naffected him. Dr. Audlin sat in his chair at the desk. Lord Mountdrago\nstill stood and his frown darkened.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I should tell you that I am His Majesty's Secretary for Foreign\nAffairs,\" he said acidly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Won't you sit down?\" the doctor repeated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLord Mountdrago made a gesture, which might have suggested! that he was\nabout to turn on his heel and stalk out of the room; but if that was his\nintention he apparently thought better of it. He seated himself. Dr.\nAudlin opened a large book and took up his pen. He wrote without looking\nat his patient.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How old are you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Forty-two.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you married?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How long have you been married?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Eighteen years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you any children?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have two sons.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Audlin noted down the facts as Lord Mountdrago abruptly answered his\nquestions. Then he leaned back in his chair and looked at him. He did\nnot speak; he just looked, gravely, with pale eyes that did not move.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why have you come to see me?\" he asked at length.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've heard about you. Lady Canute is a patient of yours, I understand.\nShe tells me you've done her a certain amount of good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Audlin did not reply. His eyes remained fixed on the other's face,\nbut they were so empty of expression that you might have thought he did\nnot even see him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't do miracles,\" he said at length. Not a smile, but the shadow of\na smile flickered in his eyes. \"The Royal College of Physicians would\nnot approve of it if I did.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLord Mountdrago gave a brief chuckle. It seemed to lessen his hostility.\nHe spoke more amiably.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You have a very remarkable reputation. People seem to believe in you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why have you come to me?\" repeated Dr. Audlin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow it was Lord Mountdrago's turn to be silent. It looked as though he\nfound it hard to answer. Dr. Audlin waited. At last Lord Mountdrago\nseemed to make an effort. He spoke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm in perfect health. Just as a matter of routine I had myself\nexamined by my own doctor the other day, Sir Augustus Fitzherbert, I\ndaresay you've heard of him, and he tells me I have the physique of a\nman of thirty. I work hard, but I'm never tired, and I enjoy my work. I\nsmoke very little and I'm an extremely moderate drinker. I take a\nsufficiency of exercise and I lead a regular life. I am a perfectly\nsound, normal, healthy man. I quite expect you to think it very silly\nand childish of me to consult you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Audlin saw that he must help him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know if I can do anything to help you. I'll try. You're\ndistressed?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLord Mountdrago frowned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The work that I'm engaged in is important. The decisions I am called\nupon to make can easily affect the welfare of the country and even the\npeace of the world. It is essential that my judgment should be balanced\nand my brain clear. I look upon it as my duty to eliminate any cause of\nworry that may interfere with my usefulness.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Audlin had never taken his eyes off him. He saw a great deal. He saw\nbehind his patient's pompous manner and arrogant pride an anxiety that\nhe could not dispel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I asked you to be good enough to come here because I know by experience\nthat it's easier for someone to speak openly in the dingy surroundings\nof a doctor's consulting-room than in his accustomed environment.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're certainly dingy,\" said Lord Mountdrago acidly. He paused. It\nwas evident that this man who had so much self-assurance, so quick and\ndecided a mind that he was never at a loss, at this moment was\nembarrassed. He smiled in order to show the doctor that he was at his\nease, but his eyes betrayed his disquiet. When he spoke again it was\nwith unnatural heartiness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The whole thing's so trivial that I can hardly bring myself to bother\nyou with it. I'm afraid you'll just tell me not to be a fool and waste\nyour valuable time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Even things that seem very trivial may have their importance. They can\nbe a symptom of a deep-seated derangement. And my time is entirely at\nyour disposal.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Audlin's voice was low and grave. The monotone in which he spoke was\nstrangely soothing. Lord Mountdrago at length made up his mind to be\nfrank.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The fact is I've been having some very tiresome dreams lately. I know\nit's silly to pay any attention to them, but--well, the honest truth is\nthat I'm afraid they've got on my nerves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can you describe any of them to me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLord Mountdrago smiled, but the smile that tried to be careless was only\nrueful.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're so idiotic, I can hardly bring myself to narrate them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never mind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, the first I had was about a month ago. I dreamt that I was at a\nparty at Connemara House. It was an official party. The King and Queen\nwere to be there and of course decorations were worn. I was wearing my\nribbon and my star. I went into a sort of cloakroom they have to take\noff my coat. There was a little man there called Owen Griffiths, who's a\nWelsh Member of Parliament, and to tell you the truth, I was surprised\nto see him. He's very common, and I said to myself: 'Really, Lydia\nConnemara is going too far, whom will she ask next?' I thought he looked\nat me rather curiously, but I didn't take any notice of him; in fact I\ncut the little bounder and walked upstairs. I suppose you've never been\nthere?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, it's not the sort of house you'd ever be likely to go to. It's a\nrather vulgar house, but it's got a very fine marble staircase, and the\nConnemaras were at the top receiving their guests. Lady Connemara gave\nme a look of surprise when I shook hands with her, and began to giggle;\nI didn't pay much attention, she's a very silly, ill-bred woman and her\nmanners are no better than those of her ancestors whom King Charles II\nmade a duchess. I must say the reception rooms at Connemara House are\nstately. I walked through, nodding to a number of people and shaking\nhands; then I saw the German Ambassador talking with one of the Austrian\nArchdukes. I particularly wanted to have a word with him, so I went up\nand held out my hand. The moment the Archduke saw me he burst into a\nroar of laughter. I was deeply affronted. I looked him up and down\nsternly, but he only laughed the more. I was about to speak to him\nrather sharply, when there was a sudden hush and I realised that the\nKing and Queen had come. Turning my back on the Archduke, I stepped\nforward, and then, quite suddenly, I noticed that I hadn't got any\ntrousers on. I was in short silk drawers, and I wore scarlet\nsock-suspenders. No wonder Lady Connemara had giggled; no wonder the\nArchduke had laughed! I can't tell you what that moment was. An agony of\nshame. I awoke in a cold sweat. Oh, you don't know the relief I felt to\nfind it was only a dream.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's the kind of dream that's not so very uncommon,\" said Dr. Audlin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say not. But an odd thing happened next day. I was in the lobby\nof the House of Commons, when that fellow Griffiths walked slowly past\nme. He deliberately looked down at my legs and then he looked me full in\nthe face and I was almost certain he winked. A ridiculous thought came\nto me. He'd been there the night before and seen me make that ghastly\nexhibition of myself and was enjoying the joke. But of course I knew\nthat was impossible because it was only a dream. I gave him an icy glare\nand he walked on. But he was grinning his head off.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLord Mountdrago took his handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped the\npalms of his hands. He was making no attempt now to conceal his\nperturbation. Dr. Audlin never took his eyes off him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell me another dream.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was the night after, and it was even more absurd than the first one.\nI dreamt that I was in the House. There was a debate on foreign affairs\nwhich not only the country, but the world, had been looking forward to\nwith the gravest concern. The government had decided on a change in\ntheir policy which vitally affected the future of the Empire. The\noccasion was historic. Of course the House was crowded. All the\nambassadors were there. The galleries were packed. It fell to me to make\nthe important speech of the evening. I had prepared it carefully. A man\nlike me has enemies, there are a lot of people who resent my having\nachieved the position I have at an age when even the cleverest men are\ncontent with situations of relative obscurity, and I was determined that\nmy speech should not only be worthy of the occasion, but should silence\nmy detractors. It excited me to think that the whole world was hanging\non my lips. I rose to my feet. If you've ever been in the House you'll\nknow how members chat to one another during a debate, rustle papers and\nturn over reports. The silence was the silence of the grave when I began\nto speak. Suddenly I caught sight of that odious little bounder on one\nof the benches opposite, Griffiths the Welsh member; he put out his\ntongue at me. I don't know if you've ever heard a vulgar music-hall song\ncalled <i>A Bicycle Made for Two</i>. It was very popular a great many years\nago. To show Griffiths how completely I despised him I began to sing it.\nI sang the first verse right through. There was a moment's surprise, and\nwhen I finished they cried 'Hear, hear,' on the opposite benches. I put\nup my hand to silence them and sang the second verse. The House listened\nto me in stony silence and I felt the song wasn't going down very well.\nI was vexed, for I have a good baritone voice, and I was determined that\nthey should do me justice. When I started the third verse the members\nbegan to laugh; in an instant the laughter spread; the ambassadors, the\nstrangers in the Distinguished Strangers' Gallery, the ladies in the\nLadies' Gallery, the reporters, they shook, they bellowed, they held\ntheir sides, they rolled in their seats; everyone was overcome with\nlaughter except the ministers on the Front Bench immediately behind me.\nIn that incredible, in that unprecedented uproar, they sat petrified. I\ngave them a glance, and suddenly the enormity of what I had done fell\nupon me. I had made myself the laughing-stock of the whole world. With\nmisery I realised that I should have to resign. I woke and knew it was\nonly a dream.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLord Mountdrago's grand manner had deserted him as he narrated this, and\nnow having finished he was pale and trembling. But with an effort he\npulled himself together. He forced a laugh to his shaking lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The whole thing was so fantastic that I couldn't help being amused. I\ndidn't give it another thought, and when I went into the House on the\nfollowing afternoon I was feeling in very good form. The debate was\ndull, but I had to be there, and I read some documents that required my\nattention. For some reason I chanced to look up and I saw that Griffiths\nwas speaking. He has an unpleasant Welsh accent and an unprepossessing\nappearance. I couldn't imagine that he had anything to say that it was\nworth my while to listen to, and I was about to return to my papers when\nhe quoted two lines from <i>A Bicycle Made for Two</i>. I couldn't help\nglancing at him and I saw that his eyes were fixed on me with a grin of\nbitter mockery. I faintly shrugged my shoulders. It was comic that a\nscrubby little Welsh member should look at me like that. It was an odd\ncoincidence that he should quote two lines from that disastrous song\nthat I'd sung all through in my dream. I began to read my papers again,\nbut I don't mind telling you that I found it difficult to concentrate on\nthem. I was a little puzzled. Owen Griffiths had been in my first dream,\nthe one at Connemara House, and I'd received a very definite impression\nafterwards that he knew the sorry figure I'd cut. Was it a mere\ncoincidence that he had just quoted those two lines? I asked myself if\nit was possible that he was dreaming the same dreams as I was. But of\ncourse the idea was preposterous and I determined not to give it a\nsecond thought.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a silence. Dr. Audlin looked at Lord Mountdrago and Lord\nMountdrago looked at Dr. Audlin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Other people's dreams are very boring. My wife used to dream\noccasionally and insist on telling me her dreams next day with\ncircumstantial detail. I found it maddening.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Audlin faintly smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not boring me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll tell you one more dream I had a few days later. I dreamt that I\nwent into a public-house at Limehouse. I've never been to Limehouse in\nmy life and I don't think I've ever been in a public-house since I was\nat Oxford, and yet I saw the street and the place I went into as exactly\nas if I were at home there. I went into a room, I don't know whether\nthey call it the saloon bar or the private bar; there was a fireplace\nand a large leather arm-chair on one side of it, and on the other a\nsmall sofa; a bar ran the whole length of the room and over it you could\nsee into the public bar. Near the door was a round marble-topped table\nand two arm-chairs beside it. It was a Saturday night and the place was\npacked. It was brightly lit, but the smoke was so thick that it made my\neyes smart. I was dressed like a rough, with a cap on my head and a\nhandkerchief round my neck. It seemed to me that most of the people\nthere were drunk. I thought it rather amusing. There was a gramophone\ngoing, or the radio, I don't know which, and in front of the fireplace\ntwo women were doing a grotesque dance. There was a little crowd round\nthem, laughing, cheering and singing. I went up to have a look and some\nman said to me: ''Ave a drink, Bill?' There were glasses on the table\nfull of a dark liquid which I understand is called brown ale. He gave me\na glass and not wishing to be conspicuous I drank it. One of the women\nwho were dancing broke away from the other and took hold of the glass.\n''Ere, what's the idea?' she said. 'That's my beer you're putting away.'\n'Oh, I'm so sorry,' I said, 'this gentleman offered it me and I very\nnaturally thought it was his to offer.' 'All right, mate,' she said, 'I\ndon't mind. You come an' 'ave a dance with me.' Before I could protest\nshe'd caught hold of me and we were dancing together. And then I found\nmyself sitting in the arm-chair with the woman on my lap and we were\nsharing a glass of beer. I should tell you that sex has never played any\ngreat part in my life. I married young because in my position it was\ndesirable that I should marry, but also in order to settle once for all\nthe question of sex. I had the two sons I had made up my mind to have,\nand then I put the whole matter on one side. I've always been too busy\nto give much thought to that kind of thing, and living so much in the\npublic eye as I do it would have been madness to do anything that might\ngive rise to scandal. The greatest asset a politician can have is a\nblameless record as far as women are concerned. I have no patience with\nthe men who smash up their careers for women. I only despise them. The\nwoman I had on my knees was drunk; she wasn't pretty and she wasn't\nyoung: in fact, she was just a blowsy old prostitute. She filled me with\ndisgust, and yet when she put her mouth to mine and kissed me, though\nher breath stank of beer and her teeth were decayed, though I loathed\nmyself, I wanted her--I wanted her with all my soul. Suddenly I heard a\nvoice. 'That's right, old boy, have a good time.' I looked up and there\nwas Owen Griffiths. I tried to spring out of the chair, but that\nhorrible woman wouldn't let me. 'Don't you pay no attention to 'im,' she\nsaid,' 'e's only one of them nosy-parkers.' 'You go to it,' he said. 'I\nknow Moll. She'll give you your money's worth all right.' You know, I\nwasn't so much annoyed at his seeing me in that absurd situation as\nangry that he should address me as 'old boy'. I pushed the woman aside\nand stood up and faced him. 'I don't know you and I don't want to know\nyou,' I said. 'I know you all right,' he said. And my advice to you,\nMolly, is, see that you get your money, he'll bilk you if he can.' There\nwas a bottle of beer standing on the table close by. Without a word I\nseized it by the neck and hit him over the head with it as hard as I\ncould. I made such a violent gesture that it woke me up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A dream of that sort is not incomprehensible,\" said Dr. Audlin. \"It is\nthe revenge nature takes on persons of unimpeachable character.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The story's idiotic. I haven't told it you for its own sake. I've told\nit you for what happened next day. I wanted to look up something in a\nhurry and I went into the library of the House. I got the book and began\nreading. I hadn't noticed when I sat down that Griffiths was sitting in\na chair close by me. Another of the Labour Members came in and went up\nto him. 'Hullo, Owen,' he said to him, 'you're looking pretty dicky\nto-day.' 'I've got an awful headache,' he answered. 'I feel as if I'd\nbeen cracked over the head with a bottle.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow Lord Mountdrago's face was grey with anguish.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I knew then that the idea I'd had and dismissed as preposterous was\ntrue. I knew that Griffiths was dreaming my dreams and that he\nremembered them as well as I did.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It may also have been a coincidence.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When he spoke he didn't speak to his friend, he deliberately spoke to\nme. He looked at me with sullen resentment.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can you offer any suggestion why this same man should come into your\ndreams?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"None.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Audlin's eyes had not left his patient's face and he saw that he\nlied. He had a pencil in his hand and he drew a straggling line or two\non his blotting-paper. It often took a long time to get people to tell\nthe truth, and yet they knew that unless they told it he could do\nnothing for them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The dream you've just described to me took place just over three weeks\nago. Have you had any since?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Every night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And does this man Griffiths come into them all?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor drew more lines on his blotting-paper. He wanted the silence,\nthe drabness, the dull light of that little room to have its effect on\nLord Mountdrago's sensibility. Lord Mountdrago threw himself back in his\nchair and turned his head away so that he should not see the other's\ngrave eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dr. Audlin, you must do something for me. I'm at the end of my tether.\nI shall go mad if this goes on. I'm afraid to go to sleep. Two or three\nnights I haven't. I've sat up reading and when I felt drowsy put on my\ncoat and walked till I was exhausted. But I must have sleep. With all\nthe work I have to do I must be at concert pitch; I must be in complete\ncontrol of all my faculties. I need rest; sleep brings me none. I no\nsooner fall asleep than my dreams begin, and he's always there, that\nvulgar little cad, grinning at me, mocking me, despising me. It's a\nmonstrous persecution. I tell you, doctor, I'm not the man of my dreams;\nit's not fair to judge me by them. Ask anyone you like. I'm an honest,\nupright, decent man. No one can say anything against my moral character\neither private or public. My whole ambition is to serve my country and\nmaintain its greatness. I have money, I have rank, I'm not exposed to\nmany of the temptations of lesser men, so that it's no credit to me to\nbe incorruptible; but this I can claim, that no honour, no personal\nadvantage, no thought of self would induce me to swerve by a hair's\nbreadth from my duty. I've sacrificed everything to become the man I am.\nGreatness is my aim. Greatness is within my reach and I'm losing my\nnerve. I'm not that mean, despicable, cowardly, lewd creature that\nhorrible little man sees. I've told you three of my dreams; they're\nnothing; that man has seen me do things that are so beastly, so\nhorrible, so shameful, that even if my life depended on it I wouldn't\ntell them. And he remembers them. I can hardly meet the derision and\ndisgust I see in his eyes and I even hesitate to speak because I know my\nwords can seem to him nothing but utter humbug. He's seen me do things\nthat no man with any self-respect would do, things for which men are\ndriven out of the society of their fellows and sentenced to long terms\nof imprisonment; he's heard the foulness of my speech; he's seen me not\nonly ridiculous, but revolting. He despises me and he no longer pretends\nto conceal it. I tell you that if you can't do something to help me I\nshall either kill myself or kill him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't kill him if I were you,\" said Dr. Audlin, coolly, in that\nsoothing voice of his. \"In this country the consequences of killing a\nfellow-creature are awkward.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shouldn't be hanged for it, if that's what you mean. Who would know\nthat I'd killed him? That dream of mine has shown me how. I told you,\nthe day after I'd hit him over the head with a beer-bottle he had such a\nheadache that he couldn't see straight. He said so himself. That shows\nthat he can feel with his waking body what happens to his body asleep.\nIt's not with a bottle I shall hit him next time. One night, when I'm\ndreaming, I shall find myself with a knife in my hand or a revolver in\nmy pocket, I must because I want to so intensely, and then I shall seize\nmy opportunity. I'll stick him like a pig; I'll shoot him like a dog. In\nthe heart. And then I shall be free of this fiendish persecution.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSome people might have thought that Lord Mountdrago was mad; after all\nthe years during which Dr. Audlin had been treating the diseased souls\nof men he knew how thin a line divides those whom we call sane from\nthose whom we call insane. He knew how often in men who to all\nappearance were healthy and normal, who were seemingly devoid of\nimagination, and who fulfilled the duties of common life with credit to\nthemselves and with benefit to their fellows, when you gained their\nconfidence, when you tore away the mask they wore to the world, you\nfound not only hideous abnormality, but kinks so strange, mental\nextravagances so fantastic, that in that respect you could only call\nthem lunatic. If you put them in an asylum not all the asylums in the\nworld would be large enough. Anyhow, a man was not certifiable because\nhe had strange dreams and they had shattered his nerve. The case was\nsingular, but it was only an exaggeration of others that had come under\nDr. Audlin's observation; he was doubtful, however, whether the methods\nof treatment that he had so often found efficacious would here avail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you consulted any other member of my profession?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Only Sir Augustus. I merely told him that I suffered from nightmares.\nHe said I was overworked and recommended me to go for a cruise. That's\nabsurd. I can't leave the Foreign Office just now when the international\nsituation needs constant attention. I'm indispensable, and I know it. On\nmy conduct at the present juncture my whole future depends. He gave me\nsedatives. They had no effect. He gave me tonics. They were worse than\nuseless. He's an old fool.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can you give any reason why it should be this particular man who\npersists in coming into your dreams?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You asked me that question before. I answered it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat was true. But Dr. Audlin had not been satisfied with the answer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Just now you talked of persecution. Why should Owen Griffiths want to\npersecute you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLord Mountdrago's eyes shifted a little. Dr. Audlin was sure that he was\nnot speaking the truth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you ever done him an injury?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLord Mountdrago made no movement, but Dr. Audlin had a queer feeling\nthat he shrank into his skin. He saw before him a large, proud man who\ngave the impression that the questions put to him were an insolence, and\nyet for all that, behind that façade, was something shifting and\nstartled that made you think of a frightened animal in a trap. Dr.\nAudlin leaned forward and by the power of his eyes forced Lord\nMountdrago to meet them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you quite sure?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite sure. You don't seem to understand that our ways lead along\ndifferent paths. I don't wish to harp on it, but I must remind you that\nI am a Minister of the Crown and Griffiths is an obscure member of the\nLabour Party. Naturally there's no social connection between us; he's a\nman of very humble origin, he's not the sort of person I should be\nlikely to meet at any of the houses I go to; and politically our\nrespective stations are so far separated that we could not possibly have\nanything in common.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can do nothing for you unless you tell me the complete truth.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLord Mountdrago raised his eyebrows. His voice was rasping.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not accustomed to having my word doubted, Dr. Audlin. If you're\ngoing to do that I think to take up any more of your time can only be a\nwaste of mine. If you will kindly let my secretary know what your fee is\nhe will see that a cheque is sent to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor all the expression that was to be seen on Dr. Audlin's face you\nmight have thought that he simply had not heard what Lord Mountdrago\nsaid. He continued to look steadily into his eyes and his voice was\ngrave and low.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you done anything to this man that he might look upon as an\ninjury?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLord Mountdrago hesitated. He looked away, and then, as though there\nwere in Dr. Audlin's eyes a compelling force that he could not resist,\nlooked back. He answered sulkily:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Only if he was a dirty, second-rate little cad.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But that is exactly what you've described him to be.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLord Mountdrago sighed. He was beaten. Dr. Audlin knew that the sigh\nmeant he was going at last to say what he had till then held back. Now\nhe had no longer to insist. He dropped his eyes and began again drawing\nvague geometrical figures on his blotting-paper. The silence lasted two\nor three minutes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm anxious to tell you everything that can be of any use to you. If I\ndidn't mention this before, it's only because it was so unimportant that\nI didn't see how it could possibly have anything to do with the case.\nGriffiths won a seat at the last election and he began to make a\nnuisance of himself almost at once. His father's a miner, and he worked\nin a mine himself when he was a boy; he's been a schoolmaster in the\nboard schools and a journalist. He's that half-baked, conceited\nintellectual, with inadequate knowledge, ill-considered ideas and\nimpracticable plans, that compulsory education has brought forth from\nthe working-classes. He's a scrawny, grey-faced man, who looks\nhalf-starved, and he's always very slovenly in appearance; heaven knows\nmembers nowadays don't bother much about their dress, but his clothes\nare an outrage to the dignity of the House. They're ostentatiously\nshabby, his collar's never clean and his tie's never tied properly; he\nlooks as if he hadn't had a bath for a month and his hands are filthy.\nThe Labour Party have two or three fellows on the Front Bench who've got\na certain ability, but the rest of them don't amount to much. In the\nkingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king: because Griffiths is glib\nand has a lot of superficial information on a number of subjects, the\nWhips on his side began to put him up to speak whenever there was a\nchance. It appeared that he fancied himself on foreign affairs, and he\nwas continually asking me silly, tiresome questions. I don't mind\ntelling you that I made a point of snubbing him as soundly as I thought\nhe deserved. From the beginning I hated the way he talked, his whining\nvoice and his vulgar accent; he had nervous mannerisms that intensely\nirritated me. He talked rather shyly, hesitatingly, as though it were\ntorture to him to speak and yet he was forced to by some inner passion,\nand often he used to say some very disconcerting things. I'll admit that\nnow and again he had a sort of tub-thumping eloquence. It had a certain\ninfluence over the ill-regulated minds of the members of his party. They\nwere impressed by his earnestness and they weren't, as I was, nauseated\nby his sentimentality. A certain sentimentality is the common coin of\npolitical debate. Nations are governed by self-interest, but they prefer\nto believe that their aims are altruistic, and the politician is\njustified if with fair words and fine phrases he can persuade the\nelectorate that the hard bargain he is driving for his country's\nadvantage tends to the good of humanity. The mistake people like\nGriffiths make is to take these fair words and fine phrases at their\nface value. He's a crank, and a noxious crank. He calls himself an\nidealist. He has at his tongue's end all the tedious blather that the\nintelligentsia have been boring us with for years. Non-resistance. The\nbrotherhood of man. You know the hopeless rubbish. The worst of it was\nthat it impressed not only his own party, it even shook some of the\nsillier, more sloppy-minded members of ours. I heard rumours that\nGriffiths was likely to get office when a Labour Government came in; I\neven heard it suggested that he might get the Foreign Office. The notion\nwas grotesque but not impossible. One day I had occasion to wind up a\ndebate on foreign affairs which Griffiths had opened. He'd spoken for an\nhour. I thought it a very good opportunity to cook his goose, and by\nGod, sir, I cooked it. I tore his speech to pieces. I pointed out the\nfaultiness of his reasoning and emphasised the deficiency of his\nknowledge. In the House of Commons the most devastating weapon is\nridicule: I mocked him; I bantered him; I was in good form that day and\nthe House rocked with laughter. Their laughter excited me and I excelled\nmyself. The Opposition sat glum and silent, but even some of them\ncouldn't help laughing once or twice; it's not intolerable, you know, to\nsee a colleague, perhaps a rival, made a fool of. And if ever a man was\nmade a fool of I made a fool of Griffiths. He shrank down in a seat, I\nsaw his face go white, and presently he buried it in his hands. When I\nsat down I'd killed him. I'd destroyed his prestige for ever; he had no\nmore chance of getting office when a Labour Government came in than the\npoliceman at the door. I heard afterwards that his father, the old\nminer, and his mother had come up from Wales, with various supporters of\nhis in the constituency, to watch the triumph they expected him to have.\nThey had seen only his utter humiliation. He'd won the constituency by\nthe narrowest margin. An incident like that might very easily lose him\nhis seat. But that was no business of mine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Should I be putting it too strongly if I said you had ruined his\ncareer?\" asked Dr. Audlin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't suppose you would.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is a very serious injury you've done him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He brought it on himself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you never felt any qualms about it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think perhaps if I'd known that his father and mother were there I\nmight have let him down a little more gently.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was nothing further for Dr. Audlin to say, and he set about\ntreating his patient in such a manner as he thought might avail. He\nsought by suggestion to make him forget his dreams when he awoke; he\nsought to make him sleep so deeply that he would not dream. He found\nLord Mountdrago's resistance impossible to break down. At the end of an\nhour he dismissed him. Since then he had seen Lord Mountdrago half a\ndozen times. He had done him no good. The frightful dreams continued\nevery night to harass the unfortunate man, and it was clear that his\ngeneral condition was growing rapidly worse. He was worn out. His\nirritability was uncontrollable. Lord Mountdrago was angry because he\nreceived no benefit from his treatment, and yet continued it, not only\nbecause it seemed his only hope, but because it was a relief to him to\nhave someone with whom he could talk openly. Dr. Audlin came to the\nconclusion at last that there was only one way in which Lord Mountdrago\ncould achieve deliverance, but he knew him well enough to be assured\nthat of his own free will he would never, never take it. If Lord\nMountdrago was to be saved from the breakdown that was threatening he\nmust be induced to take a step that must be abhorrent to his pride of\nbirth and his self-complacency. Dr. Audlin was convinced that to delay\nwas impossible. He was treating his patient by suggestion, and after\nseveral visits found him more susceptible to it. At length he managed to\nget him into a condition of somnolence. With his low, soft, monotonous\nvoice he soothed his tortured nerves. He repeated the same words over\nand over again. Lord Mountdrago lay quite still, his eyes closed; his\nbreathing was regular, and his limbs were relaxed. Then Dr. Audlin in\nthe same quiet tone spoke the words he had prepared.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You will go to Owen Griffiths and say that you are sorry that you\ncaused him that great injury. You will say that you will do whatever\nlies in your power to undo the harm that you have done him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe words acted on Lord Mountdrago like the blow of a whip across his\nface. He shook himself out of his hypnotic state and sprang to his feet.\nHis eyes blazed with passion and he poured forth upon Dr. Audlin a\nstream of angry vituperation such as even he had never heard. He swore\nat him. He cursed him. He used language of such obscenity that Dr.\nAudlin, who had heard every sort of foul word, sometimes from the lips\nof chaste and distinguished women, was surprised that he knew it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Apologise to that filthy little Welshman? I'd rather kill myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I believe it to be the only way in which you can regain your balance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Audlin had not often seen a man presumably sane in such a condition\nof uncontrollable fury. He grew red in the face and his eyes bulged out\nof his head. He did really foam at the mouth. Dr. Audlin watched him\ncoolly, waiting for the storm to wear itself out, and presently he saw\nthat Lord Mountdrago, weakened by the strain to which he had been\nsubjected for so many, weeks, was exhausted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sit down,\" he said then, sharply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLord Mountdrago crumpled up into a chair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Christ, I feel all in. I must rest a minute and then I'll go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor five minutes perhaps they sat in complete silence. Lord Mountdrago\nwas a gross, blustering bully, but he was also a gentleman. When he\nbroke the silence he had recovered his self-control.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I've been very rude to you. I'm ashamed of the things I've\nsaid to you and I can only say you'd be justified if you refused to have\nanything more to do with me. I hope you won't do that. I feel that my\nvisits to you do help me. I think you're my only chance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You mustn't give another thought to what you said. It was of no\nconsequence.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But there's one thing you mustn't ask me to do, and that is to make\nexcuses to Griffiths.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've thought a great deal about your case. I don't pretend to\nunderstand it, but I believe that your only chance of release is to do\nwhat I proposed. I have a notion that we're none of us one self, but\nmany, and one of the selves in you has risen up against the injury you\ndid Griffiths and has taken on the form of Griffiths in your mind and is\npunishing you for what you cruelly did. If I were a priest I should tell\nyou that it is your conscience that has adopted the shape and lineaments\nof this man to scourge you to repentance and persuade you to\nreparation.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My conscience is clear. It's not my fault if I smashed the man's\ncareer. I crushed him like a slug in my garden. I regret nothing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was on these words that Lord Mountdrago had left him. Reading through\nhis notes, while he waited, Dr. Audlin considered how best he could\nbring his patient to the state of mind that, now that his usual methods\nof treatment had failed, he thought alone could help him. He glanced at\nhis clock. It was six. It was strange that Lord Mountdrago did not come.\nHe knew he had intended to because a secretary had rung up that morning\nto say that he would be with him at the usual hour. He must have been\ndetained by pressing work. This notion gave Dr. Audlin something else to\nthink of: Lord Mountdrago was quite unfit to work and in no condition to\ndeal with important matters of state. Dr. Audlin wondered whether it\nbehoved him to get in touch with someone in authority, the Prime\nMinister or the Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and\nimpart to him his conviction that Lord Mountdrago's mind was so\nunbalanced that it was dangerous to leave affairs of moment in his\nhands. It was a ticklish thing to do. He might cause needless trouble\nand get roundly snubbed for his pains. He shrugged his shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After all,\" he reflected, \"the politicians have made such a mess of the\nworld during the last five-and-twenty years, I don't suppose it makes\nmuch odds if they're mad or sane.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe rang the bell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If Lord Mountdrago comes now will you tell him that I have another\nappointment at six-fifteen and so I'm afraid I can't see him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Has the evening paper come yet?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll go and see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn a moment the servant brought it in. A huge headline ran across the\nfront page: Tragic Death of Foreign Minister.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My God!\" cried Dr. Audlin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor once he was wrenched out of his wonted calm. He was shocked,\nhorribly shocked, and yet he was not altogether surprised. The\npossibility that Lord Mountdrago might commit suicide had occurred to\nhim several times, for that it was suicide he could not doubt. The paper\nsaid that Lord Mountdrago had been waiting in a Tube station, standing\non the edge of the platform, and as the train came in was seen to fall\non the rail. It was supposed that he had had a sudden attack of\nfaintness. The paper went on to say that Lord Mountdrago had been\nsuffering for some weeks from the effects of overwork, but had felt it\nimpossible to absent himself while the foreign situation demanded his\nunremitting attention. Lord Mountdrago was another victim of the strain\nthat modern politics placed upon those who played the more important\nparts in it. There was a neat little piece about the talents and\nindustry, the patriotism and vision, of the deceased statesman, followed\nby various surmises upon the Prime Minister's choice of his successor.\nDr. Audlin read all this. He had not liked Lord Mountdrago. The chief\nemotion that his death caused in him was dissatisfaction with himself\nbecause he had been able to do nothing for him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPerhaps he had done wrong in not getting into touch with Lord\nMountdrago's doctor. He was discouraged, as always when failure\nfrustrated his conscientious efforts, and repulsion seized him for the\ntheory and practice of this empiric doctrine by which he earned his\nliving. He was dealing with dark and mysterious forces that it was\nperhaps beyond the powers of the human mind to understand. He was like a\nman blindfold trying to feel his way to he knew not whither. Listlessly\nhe turned the pages of the paper. Suddenly he gave a great start, and an\nexclamation once more was forced from his lips. His eyes had fallen on a\nsmall paragraph near the bottom of a column. Sudden Death of an M.P., he\nread. Mr. Owen Griffiths, member for so-and-so, had been taken ill in\nFleet Street that afternoon and when he was brought to Charing Cross\nHospital life was found to be extinct. It was supposed that death was\ndue to natural causes, but an inquest would be held. Dr. Audlin could\nhardly believe his eyes. Was it possible that the night before Lord\nMountdrago had at last in his dream found himself possessed of the\nweapon, knife or gun, that he had wanted, and had killed his tormentor,\nand had that ghostly murder, in the same way as the blow with the bottle\nhad given him a racking headache on the following day, taken effect a\ncertain number of hours later on the waking man? Or was it, more\nmysterious and more frightful, that when Lord Mountdrago sought relief\nin death, the enemy he had so cruelly wronged, unappeased, escaping from\nhis own mortality, had pursued him to some other sphere there to torment\nhim still? It was strange. The sensible thing was to look upon it merely\nas an odd coincidence. Dr. Audlin rang the bell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell Mrs. Milton that I'm sorry I can't see her this evening. I'm not\nwell.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was true; he shivered as though of an ague. With some kind of\nspiritual sense he seemed to envisage a bleak, a horrible void. The dark\nnight of the soul engulfed him, and he felt a strange, primeval terror\nof he knew not what.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

He saw nobody but the doctor who visited him morning and evening,\nthe nurses who looked after him and the maid who brought him his meals.\nHe had contracted tuberculosis of the lungs and since at the time there\nwere reasons that made it difficult for him to go to Switzerland the\nspecialist he saw in London had sent him up to a sanatorium in the north\nof Scotland. At last the day came that he had been patiently looking\nforward to when the doctor told him he could get up; and in the\nafternoon his nurse, having helped him to dress, took him down to the\nverandah, placed cushions behind him, wrapped him up in rugs and left\nhim to enjoy the sun that was streaming down from a cloudless sky. It\nwas mid-winter. The sanatorium stood on the top of a hill and from it\nyou had a spacious view of the snow-clad country. There were people\nlying all along the verandah in deck-chairs, some chatting with their\nneighbours and some reading. Every now and then one would have a fit of\ncoughing and you noticed that at the end of it he looked anxiously at\nhis handkerchief. Before the nurse left Ashenden she turned with a kind\nof professional briskness to the man who was lying in the next chair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want to introduce Mr. Ashenden to you,\" she said. And then to\nAshenden: \"This is Mr. McLeod. He and Mr. Campbell have been here longer\nthan anyone else.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn the other side of Ashenden was lying a pretty girl, with red hair and\nbright blue eyes; she had on no make-up, but her lips were very red and\nthe colour on her cheeks was high. It emphasised the astonishing\nwhiteness of her skin. It was lovely even when you realised that its\ndelicate texture was due to illness. She wore a fur coat and was wrapped\nup in rugs, so that you could see nothing of her body, but her face was\nextremely thin, so thin that it made her nose, which wasn't really\nlarge, look a trifle prominent. She gave Ashenden a friendly look, but\ndid not speak, and Ashenden, feeling rather shy among all those strange\npeople, waited to be spoken to.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"First time they've let you get up, is it?\" said McLeod.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where's your room?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden told him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Small. I know every room in the place. I've been here for seventeen\nyears. I've got the best room here and so I damned well ought to have.\nCampbell's been trying to get me out of it, he wants it himself, but I'm\nnot going to budge; I've got a right to it, I came here six months\nbefore he did.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMcLeod, lying there, gave you the impression that he was immensely tall;\nhis skin was stretched tight over his bones, his cheeks and temples\nhollow, so that you could see the formation of his skull under it; and\nin that emaciated face, with its great bony nose, the eyes were\npreternaturally large.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Seventeen years is a long time,\" said Ashenden, because he could think\nof nothing else to say.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Time passes very quickly. I like it here. At first, after a year or\ntwo, I went away in the summer, but I don't any more. It's my home now.\nI've got a brother and two sisters; but they're married and now they've\ngot families; they don't want me. When you've been here a few years and\nyou go back to ordinary life, you feel a bit out of it, you know. Your\npals have gone their own ways and you've got nothing in common with them\nany more. It all seems an awful rush. Much ado about nothing, that's\nwhat it is. It's noisy and stuffy. No, one's better off here. I shan't\nstir again till they carry me out feet first in my coffin.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe specialist had told Ashenden that if he took care of himself for a\nreasonable time he would get well, and he looked at McLeod with\ncuriosity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you do with yourself all day long?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do? Having T.B. is a whole time job, my boy. There's my temperature to\ntake and then I weigh myself. I don't hurry over my dressing. I have\nbreakfast, I read the papers and go for a walk. Then I have my rest. I\nlunch and play bridge. I have another rest and then I dine. I play a bit\nmore bridge and I go to bed. They've got quite a decent library here, we\nget all the new books, but I don't really have much time for reading. I\ntalk to people. You meet all sorts here, you know. They come and they\ngo. Sometimes they go because they think they're cured, but a lot of\nthem come back, and sometimes they go because they die. I've seen a lot\nof people out and before I go I expect to see a lot more.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe girl sitting on Ashenden's other side suddenly spoke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should tell you that few persons can get a heartier laugh out of a\nhearse than Mr. McLeod,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMcLeod chuckled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know about that, but it wouldn't be human nature if I didn't\nsay to myself: Well, I'm just as glad it's him and not me they're taking\nfor a ride.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt occurred to him that Ashenden didn't know the pretty girl, so he\nintroduced him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, I don't think you've met Mr. Ashenden--Miss Bishop. She's\nEnglish, but not a bad girl.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How long have <i>you</i> been here?\" asked Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Only two years. This is my last winter. Dr. Lennox says I shall be all\nright in a few months and there's no reason why I shouldn't go home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Silly, I call it,\" said McLeod. \"Stay where you're well off, that's\nwhat I say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment a man, leaning on a stick, came walking slowly along the\nverandah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, look, there's Major Templeton,\" said Miss Bishop, a smile lighting\nup her blue eyes; and then, as he came up: \"I'm glad to see you up\nagain.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, it was nothing. Only a bit of a cold. I'm quite all right now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when he began to cough. He leaned\nheavily on his stick. But when the attack was over he smiled gaily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can't get rid of this damned cough,\" he said. \"Smoking too much. Dr.\nLennox says I ought to give it up, but it's no good--I can't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was a tall fellow, good-looking in a slightly theatrical way, with a\ndusky, sallow face, fine very dark eyes and a neat black moustache. He\nwas wearing a fur coat with an Astrakhan collar. His appearance was\nsmart and perhaps a trifle showy. Miss Bishop made Ashenden known to\nhim. Major Templeton said a few civil words in an easy, cordial way, and\nthen asked the girl to go for a stroll with him; he had been ordered to\nwalk to a certain place in the wood behind the sanatorium and back\nagain. McLeod watched them as they sauntered off.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder if there's anything between those two,\" he said. \"They do say\nTempleton was a devil with the girls before he got ill.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He doesn't look up to much in that line just now,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You never can tell. I've seen a lot of rum things here in my day. I\ncould tell you no end of stories if I wanted to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You evidently do, so why don't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMcLeod grinned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'll tell you one. Three or four years ago there was a woman here\nwho was pretty hot stuff. Her husband used to come and see her every\nother week-end, he was crazy about her, used to fly up from London; but\nDr. Lennox was pretty sure she was carrying on with somebody here, but\nhe couldn't find out who. So one night when we'd all gone to bed he had\na thin coat of paint put down just outside her room and next day he had\neveryone's slippers examined. Neat, wasn't it? The fellow whose slippers\nhad paint on them got the push. Dr. Lennox has to be particular, you\nknow. He doesn't want the place to get a bad name.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How long has Templeton been here?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Three or four months. He's been in bed most of the time. He's for it\nall right. Ivy Bishop'll be a damned fool if she gets stuck on him.\nShe's got a good chance of getting well. I've seen so many of them, you\nknow, I can tell. When I look at a fellow I make up my mind at once\nwhether he'll get well or whether he won't, and if he won't I can make a\npretty shrewd guess how long he'll last. I'm very seldom mistaken. I\ngive Templeton about two years myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMcLeod gave Ashenden a speculative look and Ashenden, knowing what he\nwas thinking, though he tried to be amused, could not help feeling\nsomewhat concerned. There was a twinkle in McLeod's eyes. He plainly\nknew what was passing through Ashenden's mind.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll get all right. I wouldn't have mentioned it if I hadn't been\npretty sure of that. I don't want Dr. Lennox to hoof me out for putting\nthe fear of God into his bloody patients.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen Ashenden's nurse came to take him back to bed. Even though he had\nonly sat out for an hour, he was tired, and was glad to find himself\nonce more between the sheets. Dr. Lennox came in to see him in the\ncourse of the evening. He looked at his temperature chart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's not so bad,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDr. Lennox was small, brisk and genial. He was a good enough doctor, an\nexcellent business man, and an enthusiastic fisherman. When the fishing\nseason began he was inclined to leave the care of his patients to his\nassistants; the patients grumbled a little, but were glad enough to eat\nthe young salmon he brought back to vary their meals. He was fond of\ntalking, and now, standing at the end of Ashenden's bed, he asked him,\nin his broad Scots, whether he had got into conversation with any of the\npatients that afternoon. Ashenden told him the nurse had introduced him\nto McLeod. Dr. Lennox laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The oldest living inhabitant. He knows more about the sanatorium and\nits inmates than I do. How he gets his information I haven't an idea,\nbut there's not a thing about the private lives of anyone under this\nroof that he doesn't know. There's not an old maid in the place with a\nkeener nose for a bit of scandal. Did he tell you about Campbell?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He mentioned him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He hates Campbell, and Campbell hates him. Funny, when you come to\nthink of it, those two men, they've been here for seventeen years and\nthey've got about one sound lung between them. They loathe the sight of\none another. I've had to refuse to listen to the complaints about one\nanother that they come to me with. Campbell's room is just below\nMcLeod's and Campbell plays the fiddle. It drives McLeod wild. He says\nhe's been listening to the same tunes for fifteen years, but Campbell\nsays McLeod doesn't know one tune from another. McLeod wants me to stop\nCampbell playing, but I can't do that, he's got a perfect right to play\nso long as he doesn't play in the silence hours. I've offered to change\nMcLeod's room, but he won't do that. He says Campbell only plays to\ndrive him out of the room because it's the best in the house, and he's\ndamned if he's going to have it. It's queer, isn't it, that two\nmiddle-aged men should think it worth while to make life hell for one\nanother. Neither can leave the other alone. They have their meals at the\nsame table, they play bridge together; and not a day passes without a\nrow. Sometimes I've threatened to turn them both out if they don't\nbehave like sensible fellows. That keeps them quiet for a bit. They\ndon't want to go. They've been here so long, they've got no one any more\nwho gives a damn for them, and they can't cope with the world outside.\nCampbell went away for a couple of months' holiday some years ago. He\ncame back after a week; he said he couldn't stand the racket, and the\nsight of so many people in the streets scared him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a strange world into which Ashenden found himself thrown when,\nhis health gradually improving, he was able to mix with his fellow\npatients. One morning Dr. Lennox told him he could thenceforward lunch\nin the dining-room. This was a large, low room, with great window space;\nthe windows were always wide open and on fine days the sun streamed in.\nThere seemed to be a great many people and it took him some time to sort\nthem out. They were of all kinds, young, middle-aged and old. There were\nsome, like McLeod and Campbell, who had been at the sanatorium for years\nand expected to die there. Others had only been there for a few months.\nThere was one middle-aged spinster called Miss Atkin who had been coming\nevery winter for a long time and in the summer went to stay with friends\nand relations. She had nothing much the matter with her any more, and\nmight just as well have stayed away altogether, but she liked the life.\nHer long residence had given her a sort of position, she was honorary\nlibrarian and hand in glove with the matron. She was always ready to\ngossip with you, but you were soon warned that everything you said was\npassed on. It was useful to Dr. Lennox to know that his patients were\ngetting on well together and were happy, that they did nothing imprudent\nand followed his instructions. Little escaped Miss Atkin's sharp eyes,\nand from her it went to the matron and so to Dr. Lennox. Because she had\nbeen coming for so many years, she sat at the same table as McLeod and\nCampbell, together with an old general who had been put there on account\nof his rank. The table was in no way different from any other, and it\nwas not more advantageously placed, but because the oldest residents sat\nthere it was looked upon as the most desirable place to sit, and several\nelderly women were bitterly resentful because Miss Atkin, who went away\nfor four or five months every summer, should be given a place there\nwhile they who spent the whole year in the sanatorium sat at other\ntables. There was an old Indian Civilian who had been at the sanatorium\nlonger than anyone but McLeod and Campbell; he was a man who in his day\nhad ruled a province, and he was waiting irascibly for either McLeod or\nCampbell to die so that he might take his place at the first table.\nAshenden made the acquaintance of Campbell. He was a long, big-boned\nfellow with a bald head, so thin that you wondered how his limbs held\ntogether; and when he sat crumpled in an arm-chair he gave you the\nuncanny impression of a mannikin in a puppet-show. He was brusque,\ntouchy and bad-tempered. The first thing he asked Ashenden was:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you fond of music?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No one here cares a damn for it. I play the violin. But if you like it,\ncome to my room one day and I'll play to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you go,\" said McLeod, who heard him. \"It's torture.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How can you be so rude?\" cried Miss Atkin. \"Mr. Campbell plays very\nnicely.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no one in this beastly place that knows one note from another,\"\nsaid Campbell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith a derisive chuckle McLeod walked off. Miss Atkin tried to smooth\nthings down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You mustn't mind what McLeod said.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I don't. I'll get back on him all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe played the same tune over and over again all that afternoon. McLeod\nbanged on the floor, but Campbell went on. He sent a message by a maid\nto say that he had a headache and would Mr. Campbell mind not playing;\nCampbell replied that he had a perfect right to play and if Mr. McLeod\ndidn't like it he could lump it. When next they met high words passed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was put at a table with the pretty Miss Bishop, with Templeton,\nand with a London man, an accountant, called Henry Chester. He was a\nstocky, broad-shouldered, wiry little fellow, and the last person you\nwould ever have thought would be attacked by T.B. It had come upon him\nas a sudden and unexpected blow. He was a perfectly ordinary man,\nsomewhere between thirty and forty, married, with two children. He lived\nin a decent suburb. He went up to the City every morning and read the\nmorning paper; he came down from the City every evening and read the\nevening paper. He had no interests except his business and his family.\nHe liked his work; he made enough money to live in comfort, he put by a\nreasonable sum every year, he played golf on Saturday afternoon and on\nSunday, he went every August for a three weeks' holiday to the same\nplace on the east coast; his children would grow up and marry, then he\nwould turn his business over to his son and retire with his wife to a\nlittle house in the country where he could potter about till death\nclaimed him at a ripe old age. He asked nothing more from life than\nthat, and it was a life that thousands upon thousands of his fellow-men\nlived with satisfaction. He was the average citizen. Then this thing\nhappened. He had caught cold playing golf, it had gone to his chest, and\nhe had had a cough that he couldn't shake off. He had always been strong\nand healthy, and had no opinion of doctors; but at last at his wife's\npersuasion he had consented to see one. It was a shock to him, a fearful\nshock, to learn that there was tubercle in both his lungs and that his\nonly chance of life was to go immediately to a sanatorium. The\nspecialist he saw then told him that he might be able to go back to work\nin a couple of years, but two years had passed and Dr. Lennox advised\nhim not to think of it for at least a year more. He showed him the\nbacilli in his sputum, and in an X-ray photograph the actively-diseased\npatches in his lungs. He lost heart. It seemed to him a cruel and unjust\ntrick that fate had played upon him. He could have understood it if he\nhad led a wild life, if he had drunk too much, played around with women\nor kept late hours. He would have deserved it then. But he had done none\nof these things. It was monstrously unfair. Having no resources in\nhimself, no interest in books, he had nothing to do but think of his\nhealth. It became an obsession. He watched his symptoms anxiously. They\nhad to deprive him of a thermometer because he took his temperature a\ndozen times a day. He got it into his head that the doctors were taking\nhis case too indifferently, and in order to force their attention used\nevery method he could devise to make the thermometer register a\ntemperature that would alarm; and when his tricks were foiled he grew\nsulky and querulous. But he was by nature a jovial, friendly creature,\nand when he forgot himself he talked and laughed gaily; then on a sudden\nhe remembered that he was a sick man and you would see in his eyes the\nfear of death.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt the end of every month his wife came up to spend a day or two in a\nlodging-house near-by. Dr. Lennox did not much like the visits that\nrelatives paid the patients, it excited and unsettled them. It was\nmoving to see the eagerness with which Henry Chester looked forward to\nhis wife's arrival; but it was strange to notice that once she had come\nhe seemed less pleased than one would have expected. Mrs. Chester was a\npleasant, cheerful little woman, not pretty, but neat, as commonplace as\nher husband, and you only had to look at her to know that she was a good\nwife and mother, a careful housekeeper, a nice, quiet body who did her\nduty and interfered with nobody. She had been quite happy in the dull,\ndomestic life they had led for so many years, her only dissipation a\nvisit to the pictures, her great thrill the sales in the big London\nshops; and it had never occurred to her that it was monotonous. It\ncompletely satisfied her. Ashenden liked her. He listened with interest\nwhile she prattled about her children and her house in the suburbs, her\nneighbours and her trivial occupations. On one occasion he met her in\nthe road. Chester for some reason connected with his treatment had\nstayed in and she was alone. Ashenden suggested that they should walk\ntogether. They talked for a little of indifferent things. Then she\nsuddenly asked him how he thought her husband was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think he seems to be getting on all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm so terribly worried.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must remember it's a slow, long business. One has to have\npatience.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey walked on a little and then he saw she was crying.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You mustn't be unhappy about him,\" said Ashenden gently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, you don't know what I have to put up with when I come here. I know\nI ought not to speak about it, but I must. I can trust you, can't I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I love him. I'm devoted to him. I'd do anything in the world I could\nfor him. We've never quarrelled, we've never even differed about a\nsingle thing. He's beginning to hate me and it breaks my heart.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I can't believe that. Why, when you're not here he talks of you all\nthe time. He couldn't talk more nicely. He's devoted to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, that's when I'm not here. It's when I'm here, when he sees me well\nand strong, that it comes over him. You see, he resents it so terribly\nthat he's ill and I'm well. He's afraid he's going to die and he hates\nme because I'm going to live. I have to be on my guard all the time;\nalmost everything I say, if I speak of the children, if I speak of the\nfuture, exasperates him, and he says bitter, wounding things. When I\nspeak of something I've had to do to the house or a servant I've had to\nchange it irritates him beyond endurance. He complains that I treat him\nas if he didn't count any more. We used to be so united, and now I feel\nthere's a great wall of antagonism between us. I know I shouldn't blame\nhim, I know it's only his illness, he's a dear good man really, and\nkindness itself, normally he's the easiest man in the world to get on\nwith; and now I simply dread coming here and I go with relief. He'd be\nterribly sorry if I had T.B. but I know that in his heart of hearts it\nwould be a relief. He could forgive me, he could forgive fate, if he\nthought I was going to die too. Sometimes he tortures me by talking\nabout what I shall do when he's dead, and when I get hysterical and cry\nout to him to stop, he says I needn't grudge him a little pleasure when\nhe'll be dead so soon and I can go on living for years and years and\nhave a good time. Oh, it's so frightful to think that this love we've\nhad for one another all these years should die in this sordid, miserable\nway.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Chester sat down on a stone by the roadside and gave way to\npassionate weeping. Ashenden looked at her with pity, but could find\nnothing to say that might comfort her. What she had told him did not\ncome quite as a surprise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give me a cigarette,\" she said at last. \"I mustn't let my eyes get all\nred and swollen, or Henry'll know I've been crying and he'll think I've\nhad bad news about him. Is death so horrible? Do we all fear death like\nthat?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When my mother was dying she didn't seem to mind a bit. She knew it was\ncoming and she even made little jokes about it. But she was an old\nwoman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Chester pulled herself together and they set off again. They walked\nfor a while in silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You won't think any the worse of Henry for what I've told you?\" she\nsaid at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's been a good husband and a good father. I've never known a better\nman in my life. Until this illness I don't think an unkind or ungenerous\nthought ever passed through his head.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe conversation left Ashenden pensive. People often said he had a low\nopinion of human nature. It was because he did not always judge his\nfellows by the usual standards. He accepted, with a smile, a tear or a\nshrug of the shoulders, much that filled others with dismay. It was true\nthat you would never have expected that good-natured, commonplace little\nchap to harbour such bitter and unworthy thoughts; but who has ever been\nable to tell to what depths man may fall or to what heights rise? The\nfault lay in the poverty of his ideals. Henry Chester was born and bred\nto lead an average life, exposed to the normal vicissitudes of\nexistence, and when an unforeseeable accident befell him he had no means\nof coping with it. He was like a brick made to take its place with a\nmillion others in a huge factory, but by chance with a flaw in it so\nthat it is inadequate to its purpose. And the brick too, if it had a\nmind, might cry: What have I done that I cannot fulfil my modest end,\nbut must be taken away from all these other bricks that support me and\nthrown on the dust-heap? It was no fault of Henry Chester's that he was\nincapable of the conceptions that might have enabled him to bear his\ncalamity with resignation. It is not everyone who can find solace in art\nor thought. It is the tragedy of our day that these humble souls have\nlost their faith in God, in whom lay hope, and their belief in a\nresurrection that might bring them the happiness that has been denied\nthem on earth; and have found nothing to put in their place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere are people who say that suffering ennobles. It is not true. As a\ngeneral rule it makes man petty, querulous and selfish; but here in this\nsanatorium there was not much suffering. In certain stages of\ntuberculosis the slight fever that accompanies it excites rather than\ndepresses, so that the patient feels alert and, upborne by hope, faces\nthe future blithely; but for all that the idea of death haunts the\nsubconscious. It is a sardonic theme song that runs through a sprightly\noperetta. Now and again the gay, melodious arias, the dance measures,\ndeviate strangely into tragic strains that throb menacingly down the\nnerves; the petty interests of every day, the small jealousies and\ntrivial concerns are as nothing; pity and terror make the heart on a\nsudden stand still and the awfulness of death broods as the silence that\nprecedes a tropical storm broods over the tropical jungle. After\nAshenden had been for some time at the sanatorium there came a boy of\ntwenty. He was in the navy, a sub-lieutenant in a submarine, and he had\nwhat they used to call in novels galloping consumption. He was a tall,\ngood-looking youth, with curly brown hair, blue eyes and a very sweet\nsmile. Ashenden saw him two or three times lying on the terrace in the\nsun and passed the time of day with him. He was a cheerful lad. He\ntalked of musical shows and film stars; and he read the paper for the\nfootball results and the boxing news. Then he was put to bed and\nAshenden saw him no more. His relations were sent for and in two months\nhe was dead. He died uncomplaining. He understood what was happening to\nhim as little as an animal. For a day or two there was the same malaise\nin the sanatorium as there is in a prison when a man has been hanged;\nand then, as though by universal consent, in obedience to an instinct of\nself-preservation, the boy was put out of mind: life, with its three\nmeals a day, its golf on the miniature course, its regulated exercise,\nits prescribed rests, its quarrels and jealousies, its scandal-mongering\nand petty vexations, went on as before. Campbell, to the exasperation of\nMcLeod, continued to play the prize-song and \"Annie Laurie\" on his\nfiddle. McLeod continued to boast of his bridge and gossip about other\npeople's health and morals. Miss Atkin continued to backbite. Henry\nChester continued to complain that the doctors gave him insufficient\nattention and railed against fate because, after the model life he had\nled, it had played him such a dirty trick. Ashenden continued to read,\nand with amused tolerance to watch the vagaries of his fellow-creatures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe became intimate with Major Templeton. Templeton was perhaps a little\nmore than forty years of age. He had been in the Grenadier Guards, but\nhad resigned his commission after the war. A man of ample means, he had\nsince then devoted himself entirely to pleasure. He raced in the racing\nseason, shot in the shooting season and hunted in the hunting season.\nWhen this was over he went to Monte Carlo. He told Ashenden of the large\nsums he had made and lost at baccarat. He was very fond of women and if\nhis stories could be believed they were very fond of him. He loved good\nfood and good drink. He knew by their first names the head waiters of\nevery restaurant in London where you ate well. He belonged to half a\ndozen clubs. He had led for years a useless, selfish, worthless life,\nthe sort of life which maybe it will be impossible for anyone to live in\nthe future, but he had lived it without misgiving and had enjoyed it.\nAshenden asked him once what he would do if he had his time over again\nand he answered that he would do exactly what he had done. He was an\namusing talker, gay and pleasantly ironic, and he dealt with the surface\nof things, which was all he knew, with a light, easy and assured touch.\nHe always had a pleasant word for the dowdy spinsters in the sanatorium\nand a joking one for the peppery old gentlemen, for he combined good\nmanners with a natural kindliness. He knew his way about the superficial\nworld of the people who have more money than they know what to do with\nas well as he knew his way about Mayfair. He was the kind of man who\nwould always have been willing to take a bet, to help a friend and to\ngive a tenner to a rogue. If he had never done much good in the world he\nhad never done much harm. He amounted to nothing. But he was a more\nagreeable companion than many of more sterling character and of more\nadmirable qualities. He was very ill now. He was dying and he knew it.\nHe took it with the same easy, laughing nonchalance as he had taken all\nthe rest. He'd had a thundering good time, he regretted nothing, it was\nrotten tough luck getting T.B. but to hell with it, no one can live for\never, and when you came to think of it, he might have been killed in the\nwar or broken his bloody neck in a point-to-point. His principle all\nthrough life had been, when you've made a bad bet, pay up and forget\nabout it. He'd had a good run for his money and he was ready to call it\na day. It had been a damned good party while it lasted, but every\nparty's got to come to an end, and next day it doesn't matter much if\nyou went home with the milk or if you left while the fun was in full\nswing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf all those people in the sanatorium he was probably from the moral\nstandpoint the least worthy, but he was the only one who genuinely\naccepted the inevitable with unconcern. He snapped his fingers in the\nface of death, and you could choose whether to call his levity\nunbecoming or his insouciance gallant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe last thing that ever occurred to him when he came to the sanatorium\nwas that he might fall more deeply in love there than he had ever done\nbefore. His amours had been numerous, but they had been light; he had\nbeen content with the politely mercenary love of chorus girls and with\nephemeral unions with women of easy virtue whom he met at house parties.\nHe had always taken care to avoid any attachment that might endanger his\nfreedom. His only aim in life had been to get as much fun out of it as\npossible, and where sex was concerned he found every advantage and no\ninconvenience in ceaseless variety. But he liked women. Even when they\nwere quite old he could not talk to them without a caress in his eyes\nand a tenderness in his voice. He was prepared to do anything to please\nthem. They were conscious of his interest in them and were agreeably\nflattered, and they felt, quite mistakenly, that they could trust him\nnever to let them down. He once said a thing that Ashenden thought\nshowed insight:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, any man can get any woman he wants if he tries hard enough,\nthere's nothing in that, but once he's got her, only a man who thinks\nthe world of women can get rid of her without humiliating her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was simply from habit that he began to make love to Ivy Bishop. She\nwas the prettiest and the youngest girl in the sanatorium. She was in\npoint of fact not so young as Ashenden had first thought her, she was\ntwenty-nine, but for the last eight years she had been wandering from\none sanatorium to another, in Switzerland, England and Scotland, and the\nsheltered invalid life had preserved her youthful appearance so that you\nmight easily have taken her for twenty. All she knew of the world she\nhad learnt in these establishments, so that she combined rather\ncuriously extreme innocence with extreme sophistication. She had seen a\nnumber of love affairs run their course. A good many men, of various\nnationalities, had made love to her; she accepted their attentions with\nself-possession and humour, but she had at her disposal plenty of\nfirmness when they showed an inclination to go too far. She had a force\nof character unexpected in anyone who looked so flower-like and when it\ncame to a show-down knew how to express her meaning in plain, cool and\ndecisive words. She was quite ready to have a flirtation with George\nTempleton. It was a game she understood, and though always charming to\nhim, it was with a bantering lightness that showed quite clearly that\nshe had summed him up and had no mind to take the affair more seriously\nthan he did. Like Ashenden, Templeton went to bed every evening at six\nand dined in his room, so that he saw Ivy only by day. They went for\nlittle walks together, but otherwise were seldom alone. At lunch the\nconversation between the four of them, Ivy, Templeton, Henry Chester and\nAshenden, was general, but it was obvious that it was for neither of the\ntwo men that Templeton took so much trouble to be entertaining. It\nseemed to Ashenden that he was ceasing to flirt with Ivy to pass the\ntime, and that his feeling for her was growing deeper and more sincere;\nbut he could not tell whether she was conscious of it nor whether it\nmeant anything to her. Whenever Templeton hazarded a remark that was\nmore intimate than the occasion warranted she countered it with an\nironic one that made them all laugh. But Templeton's laugh was rueful.\nHe was no longer content to have her take him as a play-boy. The more\nAshenden knew Ivy Bishop the more he liked her. There was something\npathetic in her sick beauty, with that lovely transparent skin, the thin\nface in which the eyes were so large and so wonderfully blue; and there\nwas something pathetic in her plight, for like so many others in the\nsanatorium she seemed to be alone in the world. Her mother led a busy\nsocial life, her sisters were married; they took but a perfunctory\ninterest in the young woman from whom they had been separated now for\neight years. They corresponded, they came to see her occasionally, but\nthere was no longer very much between them. She accepted the situation\nwithout bitterness. She was friendly with everyone and prepared always\nto listen with sympathy to the complaints and the distress of all and\nsundry. She went out of her way to be nice to Henry Chester and did what\nshe could to cheer him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Mr. Chester,\" she said to him one day at lunch, \"it's the end of\nthe month, your wife will be coming to-morrow. That's something to look\nforward to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, she's not coming this month,\" he said quietly, looking down at his\nplate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I am sorry. Why not? The children are all right, aren't they?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dr. Lennox thinks it's better for me that she shouldn't come.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a silence. Ivy looked at him with troubled eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's tough luck, old man,\" said Templeton in his hearty way. \"Why\ndidn't you tell Lennox to go to hell?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He must know best,\" said Chester.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIvy gave him another look and began to talk of something else.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLooking back, Ashenden realised that she had at once suspected the\ntruth. For next day he happened to walk with Chester.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm awfully sorry your wife isn't coming,\" he said. \"You'll miss her\nvisit dreadfully.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dreadfully.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave Ashenden a sidelong glance. Ashenden felt that he had something\nhe wanted to say, but could not bring himself to say it. He gave his\nshoulders an angry shrug.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's my fault if she's not coming. I asked Lennox to write and tell her\nnot to. I couldn't stick it any more. I spend the whole month looking\nforward to her coming and then when she's here I hate her. You see, I\nresent so awfully having this filthy disease. She's strong and well and\nfull of beans. It maddens me when I see the pain in her eyes. What does\nit matter to her really? Who cares if you're ill? They pretend to care,\nbut they're jolly glad it's you and not them. I'm a swine, aren't I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden remembered how Mrs. Chester had sat on a stone by the side of\nthe road and wept.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Aren't you afraid you'll make her very unhappy, not letting her come?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She must put up with that. I've got enough with my own unhappiness\nwithout bothering with hers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden did not know what to say and they walked on in silence.\nSuddenly Chester broke out irritably.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's all very well for you to be disinterested and unselfish, you're\ngoing to live. I'm going to die, and God damn it, I don't want to die.\nWhy should I? It's not fair.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTime passed. In a place like the sanatorium where there was little to\noccupy the mind it was inevitable that soon everyone should know that\nGeorge Templeton was in love with Ivy Bishop. But it was not so easy to\ntell what her feelings were. It was plain that she liked his company,\nbut she did not seek it, and indeed it looked as though she took pains\nnot to be alone with him. One or two of the middle-aged ladies tried to\ntrap her into some compromising admission, but ingenuous as she was, she\nwas easily a match for them. She ignored their hints and met their\nstraight questions with incredulous laughter. She succeeded in\nexasperating them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She can't be so stupid as not to see that he's mad about her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She has no right to play with him like that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I believe she's just as much in love with him as he is with her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dr. Lennox ought to tell her mother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNo one was more incensed than McLeod.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Too ridiculous. After all, nothing can come of it. He's riddled with\nT.B. and she's not much better.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCampbell on the other hand was sardonic and gross.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm all for their having a good time while they can. I bet there's a\nbit of hanky-panky going on if one only knew, and I don't blame 'em.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You cad,\" said McLeod.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, come off it. Templeton isn't the sort of chap to play bumble-puppy\nbridge with a girl like that unless he's getting something out of it,\nand she knows a thing or two, I bet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden, who saw most of them, knew them better than any of the others.\nTempleton at last had taken him into his confidence. He was rather\namused at himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Rum thing at my time of life, falling in love with a decent girl. Last\nthing I'd ever expected of myself. And it's no good denying it, I'm in\nit up to the neck; if I were a well man I'd ask her to marry me\nto-morrow. I never knew a girl could be as nice as that. I've always\nthought girls, decent girls, I mean, damned bores. But she isn't a bore,\nshe's as clever as she can stick. And pretty too. My God, what a skin!\nAnd that hair: but it isn't any of that that's bowled me over like a row\nof ninepins. D'you know what's got me? Damned ridiculous when you come\nto think of it. An old rip like me. Virtue. Makes me laugh like a hyena.\nLast thing I've ever wanted in a woman, but there it is, no getting away\nfrom it, she's good, and it makes me feel like a worm. Surprises you, I\nsuppose?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not a bit,\" said Ashenden. \"You're not the first rake who's fallen to\ninnocence. It's merely the sentimentality of middle age.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dirty dog,\" laughed Templeton.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does she say to it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good God, you don't suppose I've told her. I've never said a word to\nher that I wouldn't have said before anyone else. I may be dead in six\nmonths, and besides, what have I got to offer a girl like that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden by now was pretty sure that she was just as much in love with\nTempleton as he was with her. He had seen the flush that coloured her\ncheeks when Templeton came into the dining-room and he had noticed the\nsoft glance she gave him now and then when he was not looking at her.\nThere was a peculiar sweetness in her smile when she listened to him\ntelling some of his old experiences. Ashenden had the impression that\nshe basked comfortably in his love as the patients on the terrace,\nfacing the snow, basked in the hot sunshine; but it might very well be\nthat she was content to leave it at that, and it was certainly no\nbusiness of his to tell Templeton what perhaps she had no wish that he\nshould know.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen an incident occurred to disturb the monotony of life. Though McLeod\nand Campbell were always at odds they played bridge together because,\ntill Templeton came, they were the best players in the sanatorium. They\nbickered incessantly, their post-mortems were endless, but after so many\nyears each knew the other's game perfectly and they took a keen delight\nin scoring off one another. As a rule Templeton refused to play with\nthem; though a fine player he preferred to play with Ivy Bishop, and\nMcLeod and Campbell were agreed on this, that she ruined the game. She\nwas the kind of player who, having made a mistake that lost the rubber,\nwould laugh and say: Well, it only made the difference of a trick. But\none afternoon, since Ivy was staying in her room with a headache,\nTempleton consented to play with Campbell and McLeod. Ashenden was the\nfourth. Though it was the end of March there had been heavy snow for\nseveral days, and they played, in a verandah open on three sides to the\nwintry air, in fur coats and caps, with mittens on their hands. The\nstakes were too small for a gambler like Templeton to take the game\nseriously and his bidding was overbold, but he played so much better\nthan the other three that he generally managed to make his contract or\nat least to come near it. But there was much doubling and redoubling.\nThe cards ran high, so that an inordinate number of small slams were\nbid; it was a tempestuous game, and McLeod and Campbell lashed one\nanother with their tongues. Half-past five arrived and the last rubber\nwas started, for at six the bell rang to send everyone to rest. It was a\nhard-fought rubber, with sets on both sides, for McLeod and Campbell\nwere opponents and each was determined that the other should not win. At\nten minutes to six it was game all and the last hand was dealt.\nTempleton was McLeod's partner and Ashenden Campbell's. The bidding\nstarted with two clubs from McLeod; Ashenden said nothing; Templeton\nshowed that he had substantial help, and finally McLeod called a grand\nslam. Campbell doubled and McLeod redoubled. Hearing this, the players\nat other tables who had broken off gathered round and the hands were\nplayed in deadly silence to a little crowd of onlookers. McLeod's face\nwas white with excitement and there were beads of sweat on his brow. His\nhands trembled. Campbell was very grim. McLeod had to take two finesses\nand they both came off. He finished with a squeeze and got the last of\nthe thirteen tricks. There was a burst of applause from the onlookers.\nMcLeod, arrogant in victory, sprang to his feet. He shook his clenched\nfist at Campbell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Play that off on your blasted fiddle,\" he shouted. \"Grand slam doubled\nand redoubled. I've wanted to get it all my life and now I've got it. By\nGod. By God.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gasped. He staggered forward and fell across the table. A stream of\nblood poured from his mouth. The doctor was sent for. Attendants came.\nHe was dead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was buried two days later, early in the morning so that the patients\nshould not be disturbed by the sight of a funeral. A relation in black\ncame from Glasgow to attend it. No one had liked him. No one regretted\nhim. At the end of a week so far as one could tell, he was forgotten.\nThe Indian Civilian took his place at the principal table and Campbell\nmoved into the room he had so long wanted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now we shall have peace,\" said Dr. Lennox to Ashenden. \"When you think\nthat I've had to put up with the quarrels and complaints of those two\nmen for years and years... Believe me, one has to have patience to\nrun a sanatorium. And to think that after all the trouble he's given me\nhe had to end up like that and scare all those people out of their\nwits.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was a bit of a shock, you know,\" said Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was a worthless fellow and yet some of the women have been quite\nupset about it. Poor little Miss Bishop cried her eyes out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suspect that she was the only one who cried for him and not for\nherself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut presently it appeared that there was one person who had not\nforgotten him. Campbell went about like a lost dog. He wouldn't play\nbridge. He wouldn't talk. There was no doubt about it, he was moping for\nMcLeod. For several days he remained in his room, having his meals\nbrought to him, and then went to Dr. Lennox and said he didn't like it\nas well as his old one and wanted to be moved back. Dr. Lennox lost his\ntemper, which he rarely did, and told him he had been pestering him to\ngive him that room for years and now he could stay there or get out of\nthe sanatorium. He returned to it and sat gloomily brooding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why don't you play your violin?\" the matron asked him at length. \"I\nhaven't heard you play for a fortnight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why not?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's no fun any more. I used to get a kick out of playing because I\nknew it maddened McLeod. But now nobody cares if I play or not. I shall\nnever play again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNor did he for all the rest of the time that Ashenden was at the\nsanatorium. It was strange, now that McLeod was dead life had lost its\nsavour for him. With no one to quarrel with, no one to infuriate, he had\nlost his incentive and it was plain that it would not be long before he\nfollowed his enemy to the grave.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut on Templeton McLeod's death had another effect, and one which was\nsoon to have unexpected consequences. He talked to Ashenden about it in\nhis cool, detached way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Grand, passing out like that in his moment of triumph. I can't make out\nwhy everyone got in such a state about it. He'd been here for years,\nhadn't he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Eighteen, I believe.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder if it's worth it. I wonder if it's not better to have one's\nfling and take the consequences.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose it depends on how much you value life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But is this life?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden had no answer. In a few months he could count on being well,\nbut you only had to look at Templeton to know that he was not going to\nrecover. The death-look was on his face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you know what I've done?\" asked Templeton. \"I've asked Ivy to marry\nme.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAshenden was startled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did she say?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bless her little heart, she said it was the most ridiculous idea she'd\never heard in her life and I was crazy to think of such a thing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must admit she was right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite. But she's going to marry me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's madness.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say it is; but anyhow, we're going to see Lennox and ask him\nwhat he thinks about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe winter had broken at last; there was still snow on the hills, but in\nthe valleys it was melted and on the lower slopes the birch-trees were\nin bud all ready to burst into delicate leaf. The enchantment of spring\nwas in the air. The sun was hot. Everyone felt alert and some felt\nhappy. The old stagers who came only for the winter were making their\nplans to go south. Templeton and Ivy went to see Dr. Lennox together.\nThey told him what they had in mind. He examined them; they were X-rayed\nand various tests were taken. Dr. Lennox fixed a day when he would tell\nthem the results and in the light of this discuss their proposal.\nAshenden saw them just before they went to keep the appointment. They\nwere anxious, but did their best to make a joke of it. Dr. Lennox showed\nthem the results of his examinations and explained to them in plain\nlanguage what their condition was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All that's very fine and large,\" said Templeton then, \"but what we want\nto know is whether we can get married.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be highly imprudent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We know that, but does it matter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And criminal if you had a child.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We weren't thinking of having one,\" said Ivy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, then I'll tell you in very few words how the matter stands. Then\nyou must decide for yourselves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTempleton gave Ivy a little smile and took her hand. The doctor went on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think Miss Bishop will ever be strong enough to lead a normal\nlife, but if she continues to live as she has been doing for the last\neight years...\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In sanatoriums?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. There's no reason why she shouldn't live very comfortably, if not\nto a ripe old age, as long as any sensible person wants to live. The\ndisease is quiescent. If she marries, if she attempts to live an\nordinary life, the foci of infection may very well light up again, and\nwhat the results of that may be no one can foretell. So far as you are\nconcerned, Templeton, I can put it even more shortly. You've seen the\nX-ray photos yourself. Your lungs are riddled with tubercle. If you\nmarry you'll be dead in six months.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And if I don't how long can I live?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor hesitated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be afraid. You can tell me the truth.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Two or three years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you, that's all we wanted to know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey went as they had come, hand in hand; Ivy was crying softly. No one\nknew what they said to one another; but when they came into luncheon\nthey were radiant. They told Ashenden and Chester that they were going\nto be married as soon as they could get a licence. Then Ivy turned to\nChester.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should so much like your wife to come up for my wedding. D'you think\nshe would?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not going to be married here?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. Our respective relations will only disapprove, so we're not going\nto tell them until it's all over. We shall ask Dr. Lennox to give me\naway.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked mildly at Chester, waiting for him to speak, for he had not\nanswered her. The other two men watched him. His voice shook a little\nwhen he spoke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's very kind of you to want her. I'll write and ask her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen the news spread among the patients, though everyone congratulated\nthem, most of them privately told one another that it was very\ninjudicious; but when they learnt, as sooner or later everything that\nhappened in the sanatorium was learnt, that Dr. Lennox had told\nTempleton that if he married he would be dead in six months, they were\nawed to silence. Even the dullest were moved at the thought of these two\npersons who loved one another so much that they were prepared to\nsacrifice their lives. A spirit of kindliness and good will descended on\nthe sanatorium: people who hadn't been speaking spoke to one another\nagain; others forgot for a brief space their own anxieties. Everyone\nseemed to share in the happiness of the happy pair. And it was not only\nthe spring that filled those sick hearts with new hope, the great love\nthat had taken possession of the man and the girl seemed to spread its\neffulgence on all that came near them. Ivy was quietly blissful; the\nexcitement became her and she looked younger and prettier. Templeton\nseemed to walk on air. He laughed and joked as if he hadn't a care in\nthe world. You would have said that he looked forward to long years of\nuninterrupted felicity. But one day he confided in Ashenden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This isn't a bad place, you know,\" he said. \"Ivy's promised me that\nwhen I hand in my checks she'll come back here. She knows the people and\nshe won't be so lonely.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Doctors are often mistaken,\" said Ashenden. \"If you live reasonably I\ndon't see why you shouldn't go on for a long time yet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm only asking for three months. If I can only have that it'll be\nworth it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Chester came up two days before the wedding. She had not seen her\nhusband for several months and they were shy with one another. It was\neasy to guess that when they were alone they felt awkward and\nconstrained. Yet Chester did his best to shake off the depression that\nwas now habitual and at all events at meal-times showed himself the\njolly, hearty little fellow that he must have been before he fell ill.\nOn the eve of the wedding day they all dined together, Templeton and\nAshenden both sitting up for dinner; they drank champagne and stayed up\ntill ten joking, laughing and enjoying themselves. The wedding took\nplace next morning in the kirk. Ashenden was best man. Everyone in the\nsanatorium who could stand on his feet attended it. The newly married\ncouple were setting out by car immediately after lunch. Patients,\ndoctors and nurses assembled to see them off. Someone had tied an old\nshoe on the back of the car, and as Templeton and his wife came out of\nthe door of the sanatorium rice was flung over them. A cheer was raised\nas they drove away, as they drove away to love and death. The crowd\nseparated slowly. Chester and his wife went silently side by side. After\nthey had gone a little way he shyly took her hand. Her heart seemed to\nmiss a beat. With a sidelong glance she saw that his eyes were wet with\ntears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Forgive me, dear,\" he said. \"I've been very unkind to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I knew you didn't mean it,\" she faltered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I did. I wanted you to suffer because I was suffering. But not any\nmore. All this about Templeton and Ivy Bishop--I don't know how to put\nit, it's made me see everything differently. I don't mind dying any\nmore. I don't think death's very important, not so important as love.\nAnd I want you to live and be happy. I don't grudge you anything any\nmore and I don't resent anything. I'm glad now it's me that must die and\nnot you. I wish for you everything that's good in the world. I love\nyou.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI do not like long-standing engagements. How can you tell whether on a\ncertain day three or four weeks ahead you will wish to dine with a\ncertain person? The chances are that in the interval something will turn\nup that you would much sooner do and so long a notice presages a large\nand formal party. But what help is there? The date has been fixed thus\nfar away so that the guests bidden may be certainly disengaged and it\nneeds a very adequate excuse to prevent your refusal from seeming\nchurlish. You accept, and for a month the engagement hangs over you with\ngloomy menace. It interferes with your cherished plans. It disorganises\nyour life. There is really only one way to cope with the situation and\nthat is to put yourself off at the last moment. But it is one that I\nhave never had the courage or the want of scruple to adopt.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was with a faint sense of resentment then that one June evening\ntowards half-past eight I left my lodging in Half Moon Street to walk\nround the corner to dine with the Macdonalds. I liked them. Many years\nago I made up my mind not to eat the food of persons I disliked or\ndespised, and though I have on this account enjoyed the hospitality of\nfar fewer people than I otherwise should have done I still think the\nrule a good one. The Macdonalds were nice, but their parties were a\ntoss-up. They suffered from the delusion that if they asked six persons\nto dine with them who had nothing in the world to say to one another the\nparty would be a failure, but if they multiplied it by three and asked\neighteen it must be a success. I arrived a little late, which is almost\ninevitable when you live so near the house you are going to that it is\nnot worth while to take a taxi, and the room into which I was shown was\nfilled with people. I knew few of them and my heart sank as I saw myself\nlaboriously making conversation through a long dinner with two total\nstrangers. It was a relief to me when I saw Thomas and Mary Warton come\nin and an unexpected pleasure when I found on going in to dinner that I\nhad been placed next to Mary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThomas Warton was a portrait-painter who at one time had had\nconsiderable success, but he had never fulfilled the promise of his\nyouth and had long ceased to be taken seriously by the critics. He made\nan adequate income, but at the Private View of the Royal Academy no one\ngave more than a passing glance at the dull but conscientious portraits\nof fox-hunting squires and prosperous merchants which with unfailing\nregularity he sent to the annual exhibition. One would have liked to\nadmire his work because he was an amiable and kindly man. If you\nhappened to be a writer he was so genuinely enthusiastic over anything\nyou had done, so charmed with any success you might have had, that you\nwished your conscience would allow you to speak with decent warmth of\nhis own productions. It was impossible and you were driven to the last\nrefuge of the portrait painter's friend.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It looks as if it were a marvellous likeness,\" you said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMary Warton had been in her day a well-known concert singer and she had\nstill the remains of a lovely voice. She must in her youth have been\nvery handsome. Now, at fifty-three, she had a haggard look. Her features\nwere rather mannish and her skin was weather-beaten; but her short grey\nhair was thick and curly and her fine eyes were bright with\nintelligence. She dressed picturesquely rather than fashionably and she\nhad a weakness for strings of beads and fantastic ear-rings. She had a\nblunt manner, a quick sense of human folly and a sharp tongue, so that\nmany people did not like her. But no one could deny that she was clever.\nShe was not only an accomplished musician, but she was a great reader\nand she was passionately interested in painting. She had a very rare\nfeeling for art. She liked the modern, not from pose but from natural\ninclination, and she had bought for next to nothing the pictures of\nunknown painters who later became famous. You heard at her house the\nmost recent and difficult music and no poet or novelist in Europe could\noffer the world something new and strange without her being ready to\nfight on his behalf the good fight against the philistines. You might\nsay she was a highbrow; she was; but her taste was almost faultless, her\njudgment sound and her enthusiasm honest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNo one admired her more than Thomas Warton. He had fallen in love with\nher when she was still a singer and had pestered her to marry him. She\nhad refused him half a dozen times and I had a notion that she had\nmarried him in the end with hesitation. She thought that he would become\na great painter and when he turned out to be no more than a decent\ncraftsman, without originality or imagination, she felt that she had\nbeen cheated. She was mortified by the contempt with which the\nconnoisseurs regarded him. Thomas Warton loved his wife. He had the\ngreatest respect for her judgment and would sooner have had a word of\npraise from her than columns of eulogy in all the papers in London. She\nwas too honest to say what she did not think. It wounded him bitterly\nthat she held his work in such poor esteem, and though he pretended to\nmake a joke of it you could see that at heart he resented her outspoken\ncomments. Sometimes his long, horse-like face grew red with the anger he\ntried to control and his eyes dark with hatred. It was notorious among\ntheir friends that the couple did not get on. They had the distressing\nhabit of fripping in public. Warton never spoke to others of Mary but\nwith admiration, but she was less discreet and her confidants knew how\nexasperating she found him. She admitted his goodness, his generosity,\nhis unselfishness; she admitted them ungrudgingly; but his defects were\nof the sort that make a man hard to live with, for he was narrow,\nargumentative and conceited. He was not an artist and Mary Warton cared\nmore for art than for anything in the world. It was a matter on which\nshe could not compromise. It blinded her to the fact that the faults in\nWarton that maddened her were due in large part to his hurt feelings.\nShe wounded him continually and he was dogmatic and intolerant in\nself-protection. There cannot be anything much worse than to be despised\nby the one person whose approval is all in all to you; and though Thomas\nWarton was intolerable it was impossible not to feel sorry for him. But\nif I have given the impression that Mary was a discontented, rather\ntiresome, pretentious woman I have been unjust to her. She was a loyal\nfriend and a delightful companion. You could talk to her of any subject\nunder the sun. Her conversation was humorous and witty. Her vitality was\nimmense.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was sitting now on the left hand of her host and the talk around her\nwas general. I was occupied with my next-door neighbour, but I guessed\nby the laughter with which Mary's sallies were greeted that she was at\nher brilliant best. When she was in the vein no one could approach her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're in great form to-night,\" I remarked, when at last she turned to\nme.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does it surprise you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, it's what I expect of you. No wonder people tumble over one another\nto get you to their houses. You have the inestimable gift of making a\nparty go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do my little best to earn my dinner.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, how's Manson? Someone told me the other day that he was\ngoing into a nursing-home for an operation. I hope it's nothing\nserious.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMary paused for a moment before answering, but she still smiled\nbrightly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Haven't you seen the paper to-night?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I've been playing golf. I only got home in time to jump into a bath\nand change.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He died at two o'clock this afternoon.\" I was about to make an\nexclamation of horrified surprise, but she stopped me. \"Take care. Tom\nis watching me like a lynx. They're all watching me. They all know I\nadored him, but they none of them know for certain if he was my lover,\neven Tom doesn't know; they want to see how I'm taking it. Try to look\nas if you were talking of the Russian Ballet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment someone addressed her from the other side of the table,\nand throwing back her head a little with a gesture that was habitual\nwith her, a smile on her large mouth, she flung at the speaker so quick\nand apt an answer that everyone round her burst out laughing. The talk\nonce more became general and I was left to my consternation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI knew, everyone knew, that for five and twenty years there had existed\nbetween Gerrard Manson and Mary Warton a passionate attachment. It had\nlasted so long that even the more strait-laced of their friends, if ever\nthey had been shocked by it, had long since learnt to accept it with\ntolerance. They were middle-aged people, Manson was sixty and Mary not\nmuch younger, and it was absurd that at their age they should not do\nwhat they liked. You met them sometimes sitting in a retired corner of\nan obscure restaurant or walking together in the Zoo and you wondered\nwhy they still took care to conceal an affair that was nobody's business\nbut their own. But of course there was Thomas. He was insanely jealous\nof Mary. He made many violent scenes and indeed, at the end of one\ntempestuous period, not so very long ago, he forced her to promise never\nto see Manson again. Of course she broke the promise, and though she\nknew that Thomas suspected this, she took precautions to prevent him\nfrom discovering it for a fact.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was hard on Thomas. I think he and Mary would have jogged on well\nenough together and she would have resigned herself to the fact that he\nwas a second-rate painter if her intercourse with Manson had not\nembittered her judgment. The contrast between her husband's mediocrity\nand her lover's brilliance was too galling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"With Tom I feel as if I were stifling in a closed room full of dusty\nknick-knacks,\" she told me. \"With Gerrard I breathe the pure air of the\nmountain tops.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it possible for a woman to fall in love with a man's mind?\" I asked\nin a pure spirit of enquiry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What else is there in Gerrard?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat, I admit, was a poser. For my part I thought, nothing; but the sex\nis extraordinary and I was quite ready to believe that Mary saw in\nGerrard Manson a charm and a physical attractiveness to which most\npeople were blind. He was a shrivelled little man, with a pale\nintellectual face, faded blue eyes behind his spectacles, and a high\ndome of shiny bald head. He had none of the appearance of a romantic\nlover. On the other hand he was certainly a very subtle critic and a\nfelicitous essayist. I resented somewhat his contemptuous attitude\ntowards English writers unless they were safely dead and buried; but\nthis was only to his credit with the intelligentsia, who are ever ready\nto believe that there can be no good in what is produced in their own\ncountry, and with them his influence was great. On one occasion I told\nhim that one had only to put a commonplace in French for him to mistake\nit for an epigram and he had thought well enough of the joke to use it\nas his own in one of his essays. He reserved such praise as he was\nwilling to accord his contemporaries to those who wrote in a foreign\ntongue. The exasperating thing was that no one could deny that he was\nhimself a brilliant writer. His style was exquisite. His knowledge was\nvast. He could be profound without pomposity, amusing without frivolity,\nand polished without affectation. His slightest article was readable.\nHis essays were little masterpieces. For my part I did not find him a\nvery agreeable companion. Perhaps I did not get the best out of him.\nThough I knew him a great many years I never heard him say an amusing\nthing. He was not talkative and when he made a remark it was oracular.\nThe prospect of spending an evening alone with him would have filled me\nwith dismay. It never ceased to puzzle me that this dull and mannered\nlittle man should be able to write with so much grace, wit and gaiety.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt puzzled me even more that a gallant and vivacious creature like Mary\nWarton should have cherished for him so consuming a passion. These\nthings are inexplicable and there was evidently something in that odd,\ncrabbed, irascible creature that appealed to women. His wife adored him.\nShe was a fat, frowsy boring person. She had led Gerrard a dog's life,\nbut had always refused to give him his freedom. She swore to kill\nherself if he left her and since she was unbalanced and hysterical he\nwas never quite certain that she would not carry out her threat. One\nday, when I was having tea with Mary, I saw that she was distraught and\nnervous and when I asked her what was the matter she burst into tears.\nShe had been lunching with Manson and had found him shattered after a\nterrific scene with his wife.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We can't go on like this,\" Mary cried. \"It's ruining his life. It's\nruining all our lives.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why don't you take the plunge?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've been lovers so long, you know the best and the worst of one\nanother by now; you're getting old and you can't count on many more\nyears of life; it seems a pity to waste a love that has endured so long.\nWhat good are you doing to Mrs. Manson or to Tom? Are they happy because\nyou two are making yourselves miserable?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then why don't you chuck everything and just go off together and let\ncome what may?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMary shook her head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We've talked that over endlessly. We've talked it over for a quarter of\na century. It's impossible. For years Gerrard couldn't on account of his\ndaughters. Mrs. Manson may have been a very fond mother, but she was a\nvery bad one, and there was no one to see the girls were properly\nbrought up but Gerrard. And now that they're married off he's set in his\nhabits. What should we do? Go to France or Italy? I couldn't tear\nGerrard away from his surroundings. He'd be wretched. He's too old to\nmake a fresh start. And besides, though Thomas nags me and makes scenes\nand we frip and get on one another's nerves, he loves me. When it came\nto the point I simply shouldn't have the heart to leave him. He'd be\nlost without me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a situation without an issue. I'm dreadfully sorry for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn a sudden Mary's haggard, weather-beaten face was lit by a smile that\nbroke on her large red mouth; and upon my word at that moment she was\nbeautiful.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You need not be. I was rather low a little while ago, but now I've had\na good cry I feel better. Notwithstanding all the pain, all the\nunhappiness this affair has caused me, I wouldn't have missed it for all\nthe world. For those few moments of ecstasy my love has brought me I\nwould be willing to live all my life over again. And I think he'd tell\nyou the same thing. Oh, it's been so infinitely worth while.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI could not help but be moved.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no doubt about it,\" I said. \"That's love all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, it's love, and we've just got to go through with it. There's no\nway out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd now with this tragic suddenness the way out had come. I turned a\nlittle to look at Mary and she, feeling my eyes upon her, turned too.\nThere was a smile on her lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why did you come here to-night? It must be awful for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What could I do? I read the news in the evening paper while I was\ndressing. He'd asked me not to ring up the nursing-home on account of\nhis wife. It's death to me. Death. I had to come. We'd been engaged for\na month. What excuse could I give Tom? I'm not supposed to have seen\nGerrard for two years. Do you know that for twenty years we've written\nto one another every day?\" Her lower lip trembled a little, but she bit\nit and for a moment her face was twisted to a strange grimace; then with\na smile she pulled herself together. \"He was everything I had in the\nworld, but I couldn't let the party down, could I? He always said I had\na social sense.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Happily we shall break up early and you can go home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want to go home. I don't want to be alone. I daren't cry\nbecause my eyes will get red and swollen, and we've got a lot of people\nlunching with us to-morrow. Will you come, by the way? I want an extra\nman. I must be in good form; Tom expects to get a commission for a\nportrait out of it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By George, you've got courage.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you think so? I'm heartbroken, you know. I suppose that's what makes\nit easier for me. Gerrard would have liked me to put a good face on it.\nHe would have appreciated the irony of the situation. It's the sort of\nthing he always thought the French novelists described so well.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThere had been a christening that afternoon at St. Peter's, Neville\nSquare, and Albert Edward Foreman still wore his verger's gown. He kept\nhis new one, its folds as full and stiff as though it were made not of\nalpaca but of perennial bronze, for funerals and weddings (St. Peter's,\nNeville Square, was a church much favoured by the fashionable for these\nceremonies) and now he wore only his second-best. He wore it with\ncomplacence, for it was the dignified symbol of his office, and without\nit (when he took it off to go home) he had the disconcerting sensation\nof being somewhat insufficiently clad. He took pains with it; he pressed\nit and ironed it himself. During the sixteen years he had been verger of\nthis church he had had a succession of such gowns, but he had never been\nable to throw them away when they were worn out and the complete series,\nneatly wrapped up in brown paper, lay in the bottom drawers of the\nwardrobe in his bedroom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe verger busied himself quietly, replacing the painted wooden cover on\nthe marble font, taking away a chair that had been brought for an infirm\nold lady, and waited for the vicar to have finished in the vestry so\nthat he could tidy up in there and go home. Presently he saw him walk\nacross the chancel, genuflect in front of the high altar and come down\nthe aisle; but he still wore his cassock.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's he 'anging about for?\" the verger said to himself. \"Don't 'e\nknow I want my tea?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe vicar had been but recently appointed, a red-faced energetic man in\nthe early forties, and Albert Edward still regretted his predecessor, a\nclergyman of the old school who preached leisurely sermons in a silvery\nvoice and dined out a great deal with his more aristocratic\nparishioners. He liked things in church to be just so, but he never\nfussed; he was not like this new man who wanted to have his finger in\nevery pie. But Albert Edward was tolerant. St. Peter's was in a very\ngood neighbourhood and the parishioners were a very nice class of\npeople. The new vicar had come from the East End and he couldn't be\nexpected to fall in all at once with the discreet ways of his\nfashionable congregation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All this 'ustle,\" said Albert Edward. \"But give 'im time, he'll learn.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen the vicar had walked down the aisle so far that he could address\nthe verger without raising his voice more than was becoming in a place\nof worship he stopped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Foreman, will you come into the vestry for a minute. I have something\nto say to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe vicar waited for him to come up and they walked up the church\ntogether.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A very nice christening, I thought, sir. Funny 'ow the baby stopped\ncryin' the moment you took him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've noticed they very often do,\" said the vicar, with a little smile.\n\"After all I've had a good deal of practice with them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a source of subdued pride to him that he could nearly always\nquiet a whimpering infant by the manner in which he held it and he was\nnot unconscious of the amused admiration with which mothers and nurses\nwatched him settle the baby in the crook of his surpliced arm. The\nverger knew that it pleased him to be complimented on his talent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe vicar preceded Albert Edward into the vestry. Albert Edward was a\ntrifle surprised to find the two churchwardens there. He had not seen\nthem come in. They gave him pleasant nods.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-afternoon, my lord. Good-afternoon, sir,\" he said to one after the\nother.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were elderly men, both of them, and they had been churchwardens\nalmost as long as Albert Edward had been verger. They were sitting now\nat a handsome refectory table that the old vicar had brought many years\nbefore from Italy and the vicar sat down in the vacant chair between\nthem. Albert Edward faced them, the table between him and them, and\nwondered with slight uneasiness what was the matter. He remembered still\nthe occasion on which the organist had got into trouble and the bother\nthey had all had to hush things up. In a church like St. Peter's,\nNeville Square, they couldn't afford a scandal. On the vicar's red face\nwas a look of resolute benignity, but the others bore an expression that\nwas slightly troubled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's been naggin' them, he 'as,\" said the verger to himself. \"He's\njockeyed them into doin' something, but they don't 'alf like it. That's\nwhat it is, you mark my words.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut his thoughts did not appear on Albert Edward's clean-cut and\ndistinguished features. He stood in a respectful but not obsequious\nattitude. He had been in service before he was appointed to his\necclesiastical office, but only in very good houses, and his deportment\nwas irreproachable. Starting as a page-boy in the household of a\nmerchant-prince, he had risen by due degrees from the position of fourth\nto first footman, for a year he had been single-handed butler to a\nwidowed peeress and, till the vacancy occurred at St. Peter's, butler\nwith two men under him in the house of a retired ambassador. He was\ntall, spare, grave and dignified. He looked, if not like a duke, at\nleast like an actor of the old school who specialised in dukes' parts.\nHe had tact, firmness and self-assurance. His character was\nunimpeachable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe vicar began briskly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Foreman, we've got something rather unpleasant to say to you. You've\nbeen here a great many years and I think his lordship and the general\nagree with me that you've fulfilled the duties of your office to the\nsatisfaction of everybody concerned.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe two churchwardens nodded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But a most extraordinary circumstance came to my knowledge the other\nday and I felt it my duty to impart it to the churchwardens. I\ndiscovered to my astonishment that you could neither read nor write.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe verger's face betrayed no sign of embarrassment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The last vicar knew that, sir,\" he replied. \"He said it didn't make no\ndifference. He always said there was a great deal too much education in\nthe world for 'is taste.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's the most amazing thing I ever heard,\" cried the general. \"Do you\nmean to say that you've been verger of this church for sixteen years and\nnever learned to read or write?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I went into service when I was twelve, sir. The cook in the first place\ntried to teach me once, but I didn't seem to 'ave the knack for it, and\nthen what with one thing and another I never seemed to 'ave the time.\nI've never really found the want of it. I think a lot of these young\nfellows waste a rare lot of time readin' when they might be doin'\nsomething useful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But don't you want to know the news?\" said the other churchwarden.\n\"Don't you ever want to write a letter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, me lord, I seem to manage very well without. And of late years now\nthey've all these pictures in the papers I get to know what's goin' on\npretty well. Me wife's quite a scholar and if I want to write a letter\nshe writes it for me. It's not as if I was a bettin' man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe two churchwardens gave the vicar a troubled glance and then looked\ndown at the table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Foreman, I've talked the matter over with these gentlemen and\nthey quite agree with me that the situation is impossible. At a church\nlike St. Peter's, Neville Square, we cannot have a verger who can\nneither read nor write.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlbert Edward's thin, sallow face reddened and he moved uneasily on his\nfeet, but he made no reply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Understand me, Foreman, I have no complaint to make against you. You do\nyour work quite satisfactorily; I have the highest opinion both of your\ncharacter and of your capacity; but we haven't the right to take the\nrisk of some accident that might happen owing to your lamentable\nignorance. It's a matter of prudence as well as of principle.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But couldn't you learn, Foreman?\" asked the general.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, sir, I'm afraid I couldn't, not now. You see, I'm not as young as I\nwas and if I couldn't seem able to get the letters in me 'ead when I was\na nipper I don't think there's much chance of it now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We don't want to be harsh with you, Foreman,\" said the vicar. \"But the\nchurchwardens and I have quite made up our minds. We'll give you three\nmonths and if at the end of that time you cannot read and write I'm\nafraid you'll have to go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlbert Edward had never liked the new vicar. He'd said from the\nbeginning that they'd made a mistake when they gave him St. Peter's. He\nwasn't the type of man they wanted with a classy congregation like that.\nAnd now he straightened himself a little. He knew his value and he\nwasn't going to allow himself to be put upon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm very sorry, sir, I'm afraid it's no good. I'm too old a dog to\nlearn new tricks. I've lived a good many years without knowin' 'ow to\nread and write, and without wishin' to praise myself, self-praise is no\nrecommendation, I don't mind sayin' I've done my duty in that state of\nlife in which it 'as pleased a merciful providence to place me, and if I\n<i>could</i> learn now I don't know as I'd want to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In that case, Foreman, I'm afraid you must go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, sir, I quite understand. I shall be 'appy to 'and in my\nresignation as soon as you've found somebody to take my place.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut when Albert Edward with his usual politeness had closed the church\ndoor behind the vicar and the two churchwardens he could not sustain the\nair of unruffled dignity with which he had borne the blow inflicted upon\nhim and his lips quivered. He walked slowly back to the vestry and hung\nup on its proper peg his verger's gown. He sighed as he thought of all\nthe grand funerals and smart weddings it had seen. He tidied everything\nup, put on his coat, and hat in hand walked down the aisle. He locked\nthe church door behind him. He strolled across the square, but deep in\nhis sad thoughts he did not take the street that led him home, where a\nnice strong cup of tea awaited him; he took the wrong turning. He walked\nslowly along. His heart was heavy. He did not know what he should do\nwith himself. He did not fancy the notion of going back to domestic\nservice; after being his own master for so many years, for the vicar and\nchurchwardens could say what they liked, it was he that had run St.\nPeter's, Neville Square, he could scarcely demean himself by accepting a\nsituation. He had saved a tidy sum, but not enough to live on without\ndoing something, and life seemed to cost more every year. He had never\nthought to be troubled with such questions. The vergers of St. Peter's,\nlike the popes of Rome, were there for life. He had often thought of the\npleasant reference the vicar would make in his sermon at evensong the\nfirst Sunday after his death to the long and faithful service, and the\nexemplary character of their late verger, Albert Edward Foreman. He\nsighed deeply. Albert Edward was a non-smoker and a total abstainer, but\nwith a certain latitude; that is to say he liked a glass of beer with\nhis dinner and when he was tired he enjoyed a cigarette. It occurred to\nhim now that one would comfort him and since he did not carry them he\nlooked about him for a shop where he could buy a packet of Gold Flakes.\nHe did not at once see one and walked on a little. It was a long street,\nwith all sorts of shops in it, but there was not a single one where you\ncould buy cigarettes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's strange,\" said Albert Edward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo make sure he walked right up the street again. No, there was no doubt\nabout it. He stopped and looked reflectively up and down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't be the only man as walks along this street and wants a fag,\" he\nsaid. \"I shouldn't wonder but what a fellow might do very well with a\nlittle shop here. Tobacco and sweets, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave a sudden start.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's an idea,\" he said. \"Strange 'ow things come to you when you\nleast expect it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned, walked home, and had his tea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're very silent this afternoon, Albert,\" his wife remarked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm thinkin',\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe considered the matter from every point of view and next day he went\nalong the street and by good luck found a little shop to let that looked\nas though it would exactly suit him. Twenty-four hours later he had\ntaken it and when a month after that he left St. Peter's, Neville\nSquare, for ever, Albert Edward Foreman set up in business as a\ntobacconist and newsagent. His wife said it was a dreadful come-down\nafter being verger of St. Peter's, but he answered that you had to move\nwith the times, the church wasn't what it was, and 'enceforward he was\ngoing to render unto Cæsar what was Cæsar's. Albert Edward did very\nwell. He did so well that in a year or so it struck him that he might\ntake a second shop and put a manager in. He looked for another long\nstreet that hadn't got a tobacconist in it and when he found it, and a\nshop to let, took it and stocked it. This was a success too. Then it\noccurred to him that if he could run two he could run half a dozen, so\nhe began walking about London, and whenever he found a long street that\nhad no tobacconist and a shop to let he took it. In the course of ten\nyears he had acquired no less than ten shops and he was making money\nhand over fist. He went round to all of them himself every Monday,\ncollected the week's takings and took them to the bank.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne morning when he was there paying in a bundle of notes and a heavy\nbag of silver the cashier told him that the manager would like to see\nhim. He was shown into an office and the manager shook hands with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Foreman, I wanted to have a talk to you about the money you've got\non deposit with us. D'you know exactly how much it is?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not within a pound or two, sir; but I've got a pretty rough idea.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Apart from what you paid in this morning it's a little over thirty\nthousand pounds. That's a very large sum to have on deposit and I should\nhave thought you'd do better to invest it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't want to take no risk, sir. I know it's safe in the bank.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You needn't have the least anxiety. We'll make you out a list of\nabsolutely gilt-edged securities. They'll bring you in a better rate of\ninterest than we can possibly afford to give you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA troubled look settled on Mr. Foreman's distinguished face. \"I've never\n'ad anything to do with stocks and shares and I'd 'ave to leave it all\nin your 'ands,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe manager smiled. \"We'll do everything. All you'll have to do next\ntime you come in is just to sign the transfers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I could do that all right,\" said Albert uncertainly. \"But 'ow should I\nknow what I was signin'?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you can read,\" said the manager a trifle sharply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Foreman gave him a disarming smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, sir, that's just it. I can't. I know it sounds funny-like, but\nthere it is, I can't read or write, only me name, an' I only learnt to\ndo that when I went into business.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe manager was so surprised that he jumped up from his chair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's the most extraordinary thing I ever heard.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see, it's like this, sir, I never 'ad the opportunity until it was\ntoo late and then some'ow I wouldn't. I got obstinate-like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe manager stared at him as though he were a prehistoric monster.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And do you mean to say that you've built up this important business and\namassed a fortune of thirty thousand pounds without being able to read\nor write? Good God, man, what would you be now if you had been able to?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can tell you that, sir,\" said Mr. Foreman, a little smile on his\nstill aristocratic features. \"I'd be verger of St. Peter's, Neville\nSquare.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI am of a roving disposition; but I travel not to see imposing\nmonuments, which indeed somewhat bore me, nor beautiful scenery, of\nwhich I soon tire; I travel to see men. I avoid the great. I would not\ncross the road to meet a president or a king; I am content to know the\nwriter in the pages of his book and the painter in his picture; but I\nhave journeyed a hundred leagues to see a missionary of whom I had heard\na strange story and I have spent a fortnight in a vile hotel in order to\nimprove my acquaintance with a billiard-marker. I should be inclined to\nsay that I am not surprised to meet any sort of person were it not that\nthere is one sort that I am constantly running against and that never\nfails to give me a little shock of amused astonishment. This is the\nelderly Englishwoman, generally of adequate means, who is to be found\nliving alone, up and down the world, in unexpected places. You do not\nwonder when you hear of her living in a villa on a hill outside a small\nItalian town, the only Englishwoman in the neighbourhood, and you are\nalmost prepared for it when a lonely hacienda is pointed out to you in\nAndalusia and you are told that there has dwelt for many years an\nEnglish lady. But it is more surprising when you hear that the only\nwhite person in a Chinese city is an Englishwoman, not a missionary, who\nlives there none knows why; and there is another who inhabits an island\nin the South Seas and a third who has a bungalow on the outskirts of a\nlarge village in the centre of Java. They live solitary lives, these\nwomen, without friends, and they do not welcome the stranger. Though\nthey may not have seen one of their own race for months they will pass\nyou on the road as though they did not see you, and if, presuming on\nyour nationality, you should call, as likely as not they will decline to\nsee you; but if they do, they will give you a cup of tea from a silver\nteapot and on a plate of Old Worcester you will find Scotch scones. They\nwill talk to you politely, as though they were entertaining you in a\nKentish vicarage, but when you take your leave will show no particular\ndesire to continue the acquaintance. One wonders in vain what strange\ninstinct it is that has driven them to separate themselves from their\nkith and kin and thus to live apart from all their natural interests in\nan alien land. Is it romance they have sought or freedom?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut of all these Englishwomen whom I have met or perhaps only heard of\n(for as I have said they are difficult of access) the one who remains\nmost vividly in my memory is an elderly person who lived in Asia Minor.\nI had arrived after a tedious journey at a little town from which I\nproposed to make the ascent of a celebrated mountain and I was taken to\na rambling hotel that stood at its foot. I arrived late at night and\nsigned my name in the book. I went up to my room. It was cold and I\nshivered as I undressed, but in a moment there was a knock at the door\nand the dragoman came in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Signora Niccolini's compliments,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo my astonishment he handed me a hot-water bottle. I took it with\ngrateful hands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is Signora Niccolini?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She is the proprietor of this hotel,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI sent her my thanks and he withdrew. The last thing I expected in a\nscrubby hotel in Asia Minor kept by an old Italian woman was a beautiful\nhot-water bottle. There is nothing I like more (if we were not all sick\nto death of the war I would tell you the story of how six men risked\ntheir lives to fetch a hot-water bottle from a château in Flanders that\nwas being bombarded); and next morning, so that I might thank her in\nperson, I asked if I might see the Signora Niccolini. While I waited for\nher I racked my brains to think what hot-water bottle could possibly be\nin Italian. In a moment she came in. She was a little stout woman, not\nwithout dignity, and she wore a black apron trimmed with lace and a\nsmall black lace cap. She stood with her hands crossed. I was astonished\nat her appearance for she looked exactly like a housekeeper in a great\nEnglish house.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you wish to speak to me, sir?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was an Englishwoman and in those few words I surely recognised the\ntrace of a cockney accent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wanted to thank you for the hot-water bottle,\" I replied in some\nconfusion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I saw by the visitors' book that you were English, sir, and I always\nsend up a 'ot-water bottle to English gentlemen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Believe me, it was very welcome.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was for many years in the service of the late Lord Ormskirk, sir. He\nalways used to travel with a 'ot-water bottle. Is there anything else,\nsir?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not at the moment, thank you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave me a polite little nod and withdrew. I wondered how on earth it\ncame about that a funny old Englishwoman like that should be the\nlandlady of a hotel in Asia Minor. It was not easy to make her\nacquaintance, for she knew her place, as she would herself have put it,\nand she kept me at a distance. It was not for nothing that she had been\nin service in a noble English family. But I was persistent and I induced\nher at last to ask me to have a cup of tea in her own little parlour. I\nlearnt that she had been lady's-maid to a certain Lady Ormskirk, and\nSignor Niccolini (for she never alluded to her deceased husband in any\nother way) had been his lordship's chef. Signor Niccolini was a very\nhandsome man and for some years there had been an \"understanding\"\nbetween them. When they had both saved a certain amount of money they\nwere married, retired from service, and looked about for a hotel. They\nhad bought this one on an advertisement because Signor Niccolini thought\nhe would like to see something of the world. That was nearly thirty\nyears ago and Signor Niccolini had been dead for fifteen. His widow had\nnot once been back to England. I asked her if she was never homesick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't say as I wouldn't like to go back on a visit, though I expect\nI'd find many changes. But my family didn't like the idea of me marrying\na foreigner and I 'aven't spoken to them since. Of course there are many\nthings here that are not the same as what they 'ave at 'ome, but it's\nsurprising what you get used to. I see a lot of life. I don't know as I\nshould care to live the 'umdrum life they do in a place like London.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI smiled. For what she said was strangely incongruous with her manner.\nShe was a pattern of decorum. It was extraordinary that she could have\nlived for thirty years in this wild and almost barbaric country without\nits having touched her. Though I knew no Turkish and she spoke it with\nease I was convinced that she spoke it most incorrectly and with a\ncockney accent. I suppose she had remained the precise, prim English\nlady's-maid, knowing her place, through all these vicissitudes because\nshe had no faculty of surprise. She took everything that came as a\nmatter of course. She looked upon everyone who wasn't English as a\nforeigner and therefore as someone, almost imbecile, for whom allowances\nmust be made. She ruled her staff despotically--for did she not know how\nan upper servant in a great house should exercise his authority over the\nunder servants?--and everything about the hotel was clean and neat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do my best,\" she said, when I congratulated her on this, standing, as\nalways when she spoke to me, with her hands respectfully crossed. \"Of\ncourse one can't expect foreigners to 'ave the same ideas what we 'ave,\nbut as his lordship used to say to me, what we've got to do, Parker, he\nsaid to me, what we've got to do in this life is to make the best of our\nraw material.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut she kept her greatest surprise for the eve of my departure.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm glad you're not going before you've seen my two sons, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know you had any.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They've been away on business, but they've just come back. You'll be\nsurprised when you've seen them. I've trained them with me own 'ands so\nto speak, and when I'm gone they'll carry on the 'otel between them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn a moment two tall, swarthy, strapping young fellows entered the hall.\nHer eyes lit up with pleasure. They went up to her and took her in their\narms and gave her resounding kisses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They don't speak English, sir, but they understand a little, and of\ncourse they speak Turkish like natives, and Greek and Italian.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI shook hands with the pair and then Signora Niccolini said something to\nthem and they went away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're handsome fellows, Signora,\" I said. \"You must be very proud of\nthem.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am, sir, and they're good boys, both of them. They've never give me a\nmoment's trouble from the day they was born and they're the very image\nof Signor Niccolini.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must say no one would think they had an English mother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not exactly their mother, sir. I've just sent them along to say 'ow\ndo you do to 'er.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI dare say I looked a little confused.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're the sons that Signor Niccolini 'ad by a Greek girl that used to\nwork in the 'otel, and 'aving no children of me own I adopted them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI sought for some remark to make.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I 'ope you don't think that there's any blame attaches to Signor\nNiccolini,\" she said, drawing herself up a little. \"I shouldn't like you\nto think that, sir.\" She folded her hands again and with a mixture of\npride, primness and satisfaction added the final word: \"Signor Niccolini\nwas a very full-blooded man.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nNo one knew better than he that he was an important person. He was\nnumber one in not the least important branch of the most important\nEnglish firm in China. He had worked his way up through solid ability\nand he looked back with a faint smile at the callow clerk who had come\nout to China thirty years before. When he remembered the modest home he\nhad come from, a little red house in a long row of little red houses, in\nBarnes, a suburb which, aiming desperately at the genteel, achieves only\na sordid melancholy, and compared it with the magnificent stone mansion,\nwith its wide verandahs and spacious rooms, which was at once the office\nof the company and his own residence, he chuckled with satisfaction. He\nhad come a long way since then. He thought of the high tea to which he\nsat down when he came home from school (he was at St. Paul's), with his\nfather and mother and his two sisters, a slice of cold meat, a great\ndeal of bread and butter and plenty of milk in his tea, everybody\nhelping himself, and then he thought of the state in which now he ate\nhis evening meal. He always dressed and whether he was alone or not he\nexpected the three boys to wait at table. His number one boy knew\nexactly what he liked and he never had to bother himself with the\ndetails of housekeeping; but he always had a set dinner with soup and\nfish, entrée, roast, sweet and savoury, so that if he wanted to ask\nanyone in at the last moment he could. He liked his food and he did not\nsee why when he was alone he should have less good a dinner than when he\nhad a guest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had indeed gone far. That was why he did not care to go home now, he\nhad not been to England for ten years, and he took his leave in Japan or\nVancouver, where he was sure of meeting old friends from the China\ncoast. He knew no one at home. His sisters had married in their own\nstation, their husbands were clerks and their sons were clerks; there\nwas nothing between him and them; they bored him. He satisfied the\nclaims of relationship by sending them every Christmas a piece of fine\nsilk, some elaborate embroidery, or a case of tea. He was not a mean man\nand as long as his mother lived he had made her an allowance. But when\nthe time came for him to retire he had no intention of going back to\nEngland, he had seen too many men do that and he knew how often it was a\nfailure; he meant to take a house near the race-course in Shanghai: what\nwith bridge and his ponies and golf he expected to get through the rest\nof his life very comfortably. But he had a good many years before he\nneed think of retiring. In another five or six Higgins would be going\nhome and then he would take charge of the head office in Shanghai.\nMeanwhile he was very happy where he was, he could save money, which you\ncouldn't do in Shanghai, and have a good time into the bargain. This\nplace had another advantage over Shanghai: he was the most prominent man\nin the community and what he said went. Even the consul took care to\nkeep on the right side of him. Once a consul and he had been at\nloggerheads and it was not he who had gone to the wall. The taipan\nthrust out his jaw pugnaciously as he thought of the incident.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he smiled, for he felt in an excellent humour. He was walking back\nto his office from a capital luncheon at the Hong-Kong and Shanghai\nBank. They did you very well there. The food was first-rate and there\nwas plenty of liquor. He had started with a couple of cocktails, then he\nhad some excellent sauterne and he had finished up with two glasses of\nport and some fine old brandy. He felt good. And when he left he did a\nthing that was rare with him; he walked. His bearers with his chair kept\na few paces behind him in case he felt inclined to slip into it, but he\nenjoyed stretching his legs. He did not get enough exercise these days.\nNow that he was too heavy to ride it was difficult to get exercise. But\nif he was too heavy to ride he could still keep ponies, and as he\nstrolled along in the balmy air he thought of the spring meeting. He had\na couple of griffins that he had hopes of and one of the lads in his\noffice had turned out a fine jockey (he must see they didn't sneak him\naway, old Higgins in Shanghai would give a pot of money to get him over\nthere) and he ought to pull off two or three races. He flattered himself\nthat he had the finest stable in the city. He pouted his broad chest\nlike a pigeon. It was a beautiful day, and it was good to be alive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe paused as he came to the cemetery. It stood there, neat and orderly,\nas an evident sign of the community's opulence. He never passed the\ncemetery without a little glow of pride. He was pleased to be an\nEnglishman. For the cemetery stood in a place, valueless when it was\nchosen, which with the increase of the city's affluence was now worth a\ngreat deal of money. It had been suggested that the graves should be\nmoved to another spot and the land sold for building, but the feeling of\nthe community was against it. It gave the taipan a sense of satisfaction\nto think that their dead rested on the most valuable site on the island.\nIt showed that there were things they cared for more than money. Money\nbe blowed! When it came to \"the things that mattered\" (this was a\nfavourite phrase with the taipan), well, one remembered that money\nwasn't everything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd now he thought he would take a stroll through. He looked at the\ngraves. They were neatly kept and the pathways were free from weeds.\nThere was a look of prosperity. And as he sauntered along he read the\nnames on the tombstones. Here were three side by side; the captain, the\nfirst mate, and the second mate of the barque <i>Mary Baxter</i>, who had all\nperished together in the typhoon of 1908. He remembered it well. There\nwas a little group of two missionaries, their wives and children, who\nhad been massacred during the Boxer troubles. Shocking thing that had\nbeen! Not that he took much stock in missionaries; but, hang it all, one\ncouldn't have these damned Chinese massacring them. Then he came to a\ncross with a name on it he knew. Good chap, Edward Mulock, but he\ncouldn't stand his liquor, drank himself to death, poor devil, at\ntwenty-five; the taipan had known a lot of them do that; there were\nseveral more neat crosses with a man's name on them and the age,\ntwenty-five, twenty-six, or twenty-seven; it was always the same story:\nthey had come out to China; they had never seen so much money before,\nthey were good fellows and they wanted to drink with the rest: they\ncouldn't stand it, and there they were in the cemetery. You had to have\na strong head and a fine constitution to drink drink for drink on the\nChina coast. Of course it was very sad, but the taipan could hardly help\na smile when he thought how many of those young fellows he had drunk\nunderground. And there was a death that had been useful, a fellow in his\nown firm, senior to him and a clever chap too: if that fellow had lived\nhe might not have been taipan now. Truly the ways of fate were\ninscrutable. Ah, and here was little Mrs. Turner, Violet Turner, she had\nbeen a pretty little thing, he had had quite an affair with her; he had\nbeen devilish cut up when she died. He looked at her age on the\ntombstone. She'd be no chicken if she were alive now. And as he thought\nof all those dead people a sense of satisfaction spread through him. He\nhad beaten them all. They were dead and he was alive, and by George he'd\nscored them off. His eyes collected in one picture all those crowded\ngraves and he smiled scornfully. He very nearly rubbed his hands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No one ever thought I was a fool,\" he muttered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had a feeling of good-natured contempt for the gibbering dead. Then,\nas he strolled along, he came suddenly upon two coolies digging a grave.\nHe was astonished, for he had not heard that anyone in the community was\ndead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who the devil's that for?\" he said aloud.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe coolies did not even look at him, they went on with their work,\nstanding in the grave, deep down, and they shovelled up heavy clods of\nearth. Though he had been so long in China he knew no Chinese, in his\nday it was not thought necessary to learn the damned language, and he\nasked the coolies in English whose grave they were digging. They did not\nunderstand. They answered him in Chinese and he cursed them for ignorant\nfools. He knew that Mrs. Broome's child was ailing and it might have\ndied, but he would certainly have heard of it, and besides, that wasn't\na child's grave, it was a man's and a big man's too. It was uncanny. He\nwished he hadn't gone into that cemetery; he hurried out and stepped\ninto his chair. His good-humour had all gone and there was an uneasy\nfrown on his face. The moment he got back to his office he called to his\nnumber two:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, Peters, who's dead, d'you know?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Peters knew nothing. The taipan was puzzled. He called one of the\nnative clerks and sent him to the cemetery to ask the coolies. He began\nto sign his letters. The clerk came back and said the coolies had gone\nand there was no one to ask. The taipan began to feel vaguely annoyed:\nhe did not like things to happen of which he knew nothing. His own boy\nwould know, his boy always knew everything, and he sent for him; but the\nboy had heard of no death in the community.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I knew no one was dead,\" said the taipan irritably. \"But what's the\ngrave for?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe told the boy to go to the overseer of the cemetery and find out what\nthe devil he had dug a grave for when no one was dead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me have a whisky and soda before you go,\" he added, as the boy was\nleaving the room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not know why the sight of the grave had made him uncomfortable.\nBut he tried to put it out of his mind. He felt better when he had drunk\nthe whisky, and he finished his work. He went upstairs and turned over\nthe pages of <i>Punch</i>. In a few minutes he would go to the club and play\na rubber or two of bridge before dinner. But it would ease his mind to\nhear what his boy had to say and he waited for his return. In a little\nwhile the boy came back and he brought the overseer with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you having a grave dug for?\" he asked the overseer\npoint-blank. \"Nobody's dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I no dig glave,\" said the man.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the devil do you mean by that? There were two coolies digging a\ngrave this afternoon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe two Chinese looked at one another. Then the boy said they had been\nto the cemetery together. There was no new grave there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe taipan only just stopped himself from speaking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But damn it all, I saw it myself,\" were the words on the tip of his\ntongue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he did not say them. He grew very red as he choked them down. The\ntwo Chinese looked at him with their steady eyes. For a moment his\nbreath failed him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right. Get out,\" he gasped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut as soon as they were gone he shouted for the boy again, and when he\ncame, maddeningly impassive, he told him to bring some whisky. He rubbed\nhis sweating face with a handkerchief. His hand trembled when he lifted\nthe glass to his lips. They could say what they liked, but he had seen\nthe grave. Why, he could hear still the dull thud as the coolies threw\nthe spadefuls of earth on the ground above them. What did it mean? He\ncould feel his heart beating. He felt strangely ill at ease. But he\npulled himself together. It was all nonsense. If there was no grave\nthere it must have been an hallucination. The best thing he could do was\nto go to the club, and if he ran across the doctor he would ask him to\ngive him a look over.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEveryone in the club looked just the same as ever. He did not know why\nhe should have expected them to look different. It was a comfort. These\nmen, living for many years with one another lives that were methodically\nregulated, had acquired a number of little idiosyncrasies--one of them\nhummed incessantly while he played bridge, another insisted on drinking\nbeer through a straw--and these tricks which had so often irritated the\ntaipan now gave him a sense of security. He needed it, for he could not\nget out of his head that strange sight he had seen; he played bridge\nvery badly; his partner was censorious, and the taipan lost his temper.\nHe thought the men were looking at him oddly. He wondered what they saw\nin him that was unaccustomed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSuddenly he felt he could not bear to stay in the club any longer. As he\nwent out he saw the doctor reading <i>The Times</i> in the reading-room, but\nhe could not bring himself to speak to him. He wanted to see for himself\nwhether that grave was really there and stepping into his chair he told\nhis bearers to take him to the cemetery. You couldn't have an\nhallucination twice, could you? And besides, he would take the overseer\nin with him and if the grave was not there he wouldn't see it, and if it\nwas he'd give the overseer the soundest thrashing he'd ever had. But the\noverseer was nowhere to be found. He had gone out and taken the keys\nwith him. When the taipan found he could not get into the cemetery he\nfelt suddenly exhausted. He got back into his chair and told his bearers\nto take him home. He would lie down for half an hour before dinner. He\nwas tired out. That was it. He had heard that people had hallucinations\nwhen they were tired. When his boy came in to put out his clothes for\ndinner it was only by an effort of will that he got up. He had a strong\ninclination not to dress that evening, but he resisted it: he made it a\nrule to dress, he had dressed every evening for twenty years and it\nwould never do to break his rule. But he ordered a bottle of champagne\nwith his dinner and that made him feel more comfortable. Afterwards he\ntold the boy to bring him the best brandy. When he had drunk a couple of\nglasses of this he felt himself again. Hallucinations be damned! He went\nto the billiard-room and practised a few difficult shots. There could\nnot be much the matter with him when his eye was so sure. When he went\nto bed he sank immediately into a sound sleep.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut suddenly he awoke. He had dreamed of that open grave and the coolies\ndigging leisurely. He was sure he had seen them. It was absurd to say it\nwas an hallucination when he had seen them with his own eyes. Then he\nheard the rattle of the night-watchman going his rounds. It broke upon\nthe stillness of the night so harshly that it made him jump out of his\nskin. And then terror seized him. He felt a horror of the winding\nmultitudinous streets of the Chinese city, and there was something\nghastly and terrible in the convoluted roofs of the temples with their\ndevils grimacing and tortured. He loathed the smells that assaulted his\nnostrils. And the people. Those myriads of blue-clad coolies, and the\nbeggars in their filthy rags, and the merchants and the magistrates,\nsleek, smiling, and inscrutable, in their long black gowns. They seemed\nto press upon him with menace. He hated the country. China. Why had he\never come? He was panic-stricken now. He must get out. He would not stay\nanother year, another month. What did he care about Shanghai?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my God,\" he cried, \"if I were only safely back in England.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe wanted to go home. If he had to die he wanted to die in England. He\ncould not bear to be buried among all these yellow men, with their\nslanting eyes and their grinning faces. He wanted to be buried at home,\nnot in that grave he had seen that day. He could never rest there.\nNever. What did it matter what people thought? Let them think what they\nliked. The only thing that mattered was to get away while he had the\nchance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got out of bed and wrote to the head of the firm and said he had\ndiscovered he was dangerously ill. He must be replaced. He could not\nstay longer than was absolutely necessary. He must go home at once.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey found the letter in the morning clenched in the taipan's hand. He\nhad slipped down between the desk and the chair. He was stone dead.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nMr. Pete was in a state of the liveliest exasperation. He had been in\nthe consular service for more than twenty years and he had had to deal\nwith all manner of vexatious people, officials who would not listen to\nreason, merchants who took the British Government for a debt-collecting\nagency, missionaries who resented as gross injustice any attempt at fair\nplay; but he never recollected a case which had left him more completely\nat a loss. He was a mild-mannered man, but for no reason he flew into a\npassion with his writer and he very nearly sacked the Eurasian clerk\nbecause he had wrongly spelt two words in a letter placed before him for\nhis official signature. He was a conscientious man and he could not\npersuade himself to leave his office before the clock struck four, but\nthe moment it did he jumped up and called for his hat and stick. Because\nhis boy did not bring them at once he abused him roundly. They say that\nthe consuls all grow a little odd; and the merchants who can live for\nthirty-five years in China without learning enough of the language to\nask their way in the street say that it is because they have to study\nChinese; and there was no doubt that Mr. Pete was decidedly odd. He was\na bachelor and on that account had been sent to a series of posts which\nby reason of their isolation were thought unsuited to married men. He\nhad lived so much alone that his natural tendency to eccentricity had\ndeveloped to an extravagant degree, and he had habits which surprised\nthe stranger. He was very absent-minded. He paid no attention to his\nhouse, which was always in great disorder, nor to his food; his boys\ngave him to eat what they liked and for everything he had made him pay\nthrough the nose. He was untiring in his efforts to suppress the opium\ntraffic, but he was the only person in the city who did not know that\nhis servants kept opium in the consulate itself, and a busy traffic in\nthe drug was openly conducted at the back door of the compound. He was\nan ardent collector and the house provided for him by the government was\nfilled with the various things which he had collected one after the\nother, pewter, brass, carved wood; these were his more legitimate\nenterprises; but he also collected stamps, birds' eggs, hotel labels,\nand postmarks: he boasted that he had a collection of postmarks which\nwas unequalled in the Empire. During his long sojourning in lonely\nplaces he had read a great deal, and though he was no sinologue he had a\ngreater knowledge of China, its history, literature, and people, than\nmost of his colleagues; but from his wide reading he had acquired not\ntoleration but vanity. He was a man of a singular appearance. His body\nwas small and frail and when he walked he gave you the idea of a dead\nleaf dancing before the wind; and then there was something\nextraordinarily odd in the small Tyrolese hat, with a cock's feather in\nit, very old and shabby, which he wore perched rakishly on the side of\nhis large head. He was exceedingly bald. You saw that his eyes, blue and\npale, were weak behind the spectacles, and a drooping, ragged, dingy\nmoustache did not hide the peevishness of his mouth. And now, turning\nout of the street in which was the consulate, he made his way on to the\ncity wall, for there only in the multitudinous city was it possible to\nwalk with comfort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was a man who took his work hardly, worrying himself to death over\nevery trifle, but as a rule a walk on the wall soothed and rested him.\nThe city stood in the midst of a great plain and often at sundown from\nthe wall you could see in the distance the snow-capped mountains, the\nmountains of Tibet; but now he walked quickly, looking neither to the\nright nor to the left, and his fat spaniel frisked about him unobserved.\nHe talked to himself rapidly in a low monotone. The cause of his\nirritation was a visit that he had that day received from a lady who\ncalled herself Mrs. Yü and whom he with a consular passion for precision\ninsisted on calling Miss Lambert. This in itself sufficed to deprive\ntheir intercourse of amenity. She was an Englishwoman married to a\nChinese. She had arrived two years before with her husband from England,\nwhere he had been studying at the University of London; he had made her\nbelieve that he was a great personage in his own country and she had\nimagined herself to be coming to a gorgeous palace and a position of\nconsequence. It was a bitter surprise when she found herself brought to\na shabby Chinese house crowded with people: there was not even a foreign\nbed in it, nor a knife and fork: everything seemed to her very dirty and\nsmelly. It was a shock to find that she had to live with her husband's\nfather and mother and he told her that she must do exactly what his\nmother bade her; but in her complete ignorance of Chinese it was not\ntill she had been two or three days in the house that she realised that\nshe was not her husband's only wife. He had been married as a boy before\nhe left his native city to acquire the knowledge of the barbarians. When\nshe bitterly upbraided him for deceiving her he shrugged his shoulders.\nThere was nothing to prevent a Chinese from having two wives if he\nwanted them and, he added with some disregard to truth, no Chinese woman\nlooked upon it as a hardship. It was upon making this discovery that she\npaid her first visit to the consul. He had already heard of her\narrival--in China everyone knows everything about everyone--and he\nreceived her without surprise. Nor had he much sympathy to show her.\nThat a foreign woman should marry a Chinese at all filled him with\nindignation, but that she should do so without making proper inquiries\nvexed him like a personal affront. She was not at all the sort of woman\nwhose appearance led you to imagine that she would be guilty of such a\nfolly. She was a solid, thick-set, young person, short, plain, and\nmatter-of-fact. She was cheaply dressed in a tailor-made suit and she\nwore a tam-o'-shanter. She had bad teeth and a muddy skin. Her hands\nwere large and red and ill-cared for. You could tell that she was not\nunused to hard work. She spoke English with a cockney whine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did you meet Mr. Yü?\" asked the consul frigidly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you see, it's like this,\" she answered. \"Dad was in a very good\nposition, and when he died mother said: 'Well, it seems a sinful waste\nto keep all these rooms empty, I'll put a card in the window.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe consul interrupted her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He had lodgings with you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, they weren't exactly lodgings,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shall we say apartments then?\" replied the consul, with his thin,\nslightly vain smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat was generally the explanation of these marriages. Then because he\nthought her a very foolish vulgar woman he explained bluntly that\naccording to English law she was not married to Yü and that the best\nthing she could do was to go back to England at once. She began to cry\nand his heart softened a little to her. He promised to put her in charge\nof some missionary ladies who would look after her on the long journey,\nand indeed, if she liked, he would see if meanwhile she could not live\nin one of the missions. But while he talked Miss Lambert dried her\ntears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's the good of going back to England?\" she said at last. \"I 'aven't\ngot nowhere to go to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can go to your mother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was all against my marrying Mr. Yü. I should never hear the last of\nit if I was to go back now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe consul began to argue with her, but the more he argued the more\ndetermined she became, and at last he lost his temper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you like to stay here with a man who isn't your husband it's your\nown look-out, but I wash my hands of all responsibility.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer retort had often rankled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then you've got no cause to worry,\" she said, and the look on her face\nreturned to him whenever he thought of her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat was two years ago and he had seen her once or twice since then. It\nappeared that she got on very badly both with her mother-in-law and with\nher husband's other wife, and she had come to the consul with\npreposterous questions about her rights according to Chinese law. He\nrepeated his offer to get her away, but she remained steadfast in her\nrefusal to go, and their interview always ended in the consul's flying\ninto a passion. He was almost inclined to pity the rascally Yü who had\nto keep the peace between three warring women. According to his English\nwife's account he was not unkind to her. He tried to act fairly by both\nhis wives. Miss Lambert did not improve. The consul knew that ordinarily\nshe wore Chinese clothes, but when she came to see him she put on\nEuropean dress. She was become extremely blowsy. Her health suffered\nfrom the Chinese food she ate and she was beginning to look wretchedly\nill. But really he was shocked when she had been shown into his office\nthat day. She wore no hat and her hair was dishevelled. She was in a\nhighly hysterical state.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're trying to poison me,\" she screamed and she put before him a\nbowl of some foul-smelling food. \"It's poisoned,\" she said. \"I've been\nill for the last ten days, it's only by a miracle I've escaped.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a long story, circumstantial and probable enough to\nconvince him: after all, nothing was more likely than that the Chinese\nwomen should use familiar methods to get rid of an intruder who was\nhateful to them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do they know you've come here?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course they do; I told them I was going to show them up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow at last was the moment for decisive action. The consul looked at her\nin his most official manner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you must never go back there. I refuse to put up with your\nnonsense any longer. I insist on your leaving this man who isn't your\nhusband.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he found himself helpless against the woman's insane obstinacy. He\nrepeated all the arguments he had used so often, but she would not\nlisten, and as usual he lost his temper. It was then, in answer to his\nfinal, desperate question, that she had made the remark which had\nentirely robbed him of his calm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what on earth makes you stay with the man?\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe hesitated for a moment and a curious look came into her eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's something in the way his hair grows on his forehead that I\ncan't help liking,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe consul had never heard anything so outrageous. It really was the\nlast straw. And now while he strode along, trying to walk off his anger,\nthough he was not a man who often used bad language he really could not\nrestrain himself, and he said fiercely:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Women are simply bloody.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nFor thirty years now I have been studying my fellow-men. I do not know\nvery much about them. I should certainly hesitate to engage a servant on\nhis face, and yet I suppose it is on the face that for the most part we\njudge the persons we meet. We draw our conclusions from the shape of the\njaw, the look in the eyes, the contour of the mouth. I wonder if we are\nmore often right than wrong. Why novels and plays are so often untrue to\nlife is because their authors, perhaps of necessity, make their\ncharacters all of a piece. They cannot afford to make them\nself-contradictory, for then they become incomprehensible, and yet\nself-contradictory is what most of us are. We are a haphazard bundle of\ninconsistent qualities. In books on logic they will tell you that it is\nabsurd to say that yellow is tubular or gratitude heavier than air; but\nin that mixture of incongruities that makes up the self yellow may very\nwell be a horse and cart and gratitude the middle of next week. I shrug\nmy shoulders when people tell me that their first impressions of a\nperson are always right. I think they must have small insight or great\nvanity. For my own part I find that the longer I know people the more\nthey puzzle me: my oldest friends are just those of whom I can say that\nI don't know the first thing about them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThese reflections have occurred to me because I read in this morning's\npaper that Edward Hyde Burton had died at Kobe. He was a merchant and he\nhad been in business in Japan for many years. I knew him very little,\nbut he interested me because once he gave me a great surprise. Unless I\nhad heard the story from his own lips I should never have believed that\nhe was capable of such an action. It was more startling because both in\nappearance and manner he suggested a very definite type. Here if ever\nwas a man all of a piece. He was a tiny little fellow, not much more\nthan five feet four in height, and very slender, with white hair, a red\nface much wrinkled, and blue eyes. I suppose he was about sixty when I\nknew him. He was always neatly and quietly dressed in accordance with\nhis age and station.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThough his offices were in Kobe Burton often came down to Yokohama. I\nhappened on one occasion to be spending a few days there, waiting for a\nship, and I was introduced to him at the British Club. We played bridge\ntogether. He played a good game and a generous one. He did not talk very\nmuch, either then or later when we were having drinks, but what he said\nwas sensible. He had a quiet, dry humour. He seemed to be popular at the\nclub and afterwards, when he had gone, they described him as one of the\nbest. It happened that we were both staying at the Grand Hotel and next\nday he asked me to dine with him. I met his wife, fat, elderly and\nsmiling, and his two daughters. It was evidently a united and\naffectionate family. I think the chief thing that struck me about Burton\nwas his kindliness. There was something very pleasing in his mild blue\neyes. His voice was gentle; you could not imagine that he could possibly\nraise it in anger; his smile was benign. Here was a man who attracted\nyou because you felt in him a real love for his fellows. He had charm.\nBut there was nothing mawkish in him: he liked his game of cards and his\ncocktail, he could tell with point a good and spicy story, and in his\nyouth he had been something of an athlete. He was a rich man and he had\nmade every penny himself. I suppose one thing that made you like him was\nthat he was so small and frail; he aroused your instincts of protection.\nYou felt that he could not bear to hurt a fly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne afternoon I was sitting in the lounge of the Grand Hotel. This was\nbefore the earthquake and they had leather arm-chairs there. From the\nwindows you had a spacious view of the harbour with its crowded traffic.\nThere were great liners on their way to Vancouver and San Francisco or\nto Europe by way of Shanghai, Hong-Kong and Singapore; there were tramps\nof all nations, battered and sea-worn, junks with their high sterns and\ngreat coloured sails, and innumerable sampans. It was a busy,\nexhilarating scene, and yet, I know not why, restful to the spirit. Here\nwas romance and it seemed that you had but to stretch out your hand to\ntouch it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBurton came into the lounge presently and caught sight of me. He seated\nhimself in the chair next to mine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you say to a little drink?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe clapped his hands for a boy and ordered two gin fizzes. As the boy\nbrought them a man passed along the street outside and seeing me waved\nhis hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you know Turner?\" said Burton as I nodded a greeting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've met him at the club. I'm told he's a remittance man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I believe he is. We have a good many here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He plays bridge well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They generally do. There was a fellow here last year, oddly enough a\nnamesake of mine, who was the best bridge player I ever met. I suppose\nyou never came across him in London. Lenny Button he called himself. I\nbelieve he'd belonged to some very good clubs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I don't believe I remember the name.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was quite a remarkable player. He seemed to have an instinct about\nthe cards. It was uncanny. I used to play with him a lot. He was in Kobe\nfor some time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBurton sipped his gin fizz.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's rather a funny story,\" he said. \"He wasn't a bad chap. I liked\nhim. He was always well-dressed and smart-looking. He was handsome in a\nway with curly hair and pink-and-white cheeks. Women thought a lot of\nhim. There was no harm in him, you know, he was only wild. Of course he\ndrank too much. Those sort of fellows always do. A bit of money used to\ncome in for him once a quarter and he made a bit more by card-playing.\nHe won a good deal of mine, I know that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nButton gave a kindly chuckle. I knew from my own experience that he\ncould lose money at bridge with a good grace. He stroked his shaven chin\nwith his thin hand; the veins stood out on it and it was almost\ntransparent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose that is why he came to me when he went broke, that and the\nfact that he was a namesake of mine. He came to see me in my office one\nday and asked me for a job. I was rather surprised. He told me that\nthere was no more money coming from home and he wanted to work. I asked\nhim how old he was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Thirty-five,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'And what have you been doing hitherto?' I asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Well, nothing very much,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I couldn't help laughing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I'm afraid I can't do anything for you just yet,' I said. 'Come back\nand see me in another thirty-five years, and I'll see what I can do.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He didn't move. He went rather pale. He hesitated for a moment and then\nhe told me that he had had bad luck at cards for some time. He hadn't\nbeen willing to stick to bridge, he'd been playing poker, and he'd got\ntrimmed. He hadn't a penny. He'd pawned everything he had. He couldn't\npay his hotel bill and they wouldn't give him any more credit. He was\ndown and out. If he couldn't get something to do he'd have to commit\nsuicide.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I looked at him for a bit. I could see now that he was all to pieces.\nHe'd been drinking more than usual and he looked fifty. The girls\nwouldn't have thought so much of him if they'd seen him then.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Well, isn't there anything you can do except play cards?' I asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I can swim,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Swim!'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I could hardly believe my ears; it seemed such an insane answer to\ngive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I swam for my university.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I got some glimmering of what he was driving at. I've known too many\nmen who were little tin gods at their university to be impressed by it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I was a pretty good swimmer myself when I was a young man,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Suddenly I had an idea.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPausing in his story, Burton turned to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you know Kobe?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No,\" I said, \"I passed through it once, but I only spent a night\nthere.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then you don't know the Shioya Club. When I was a young man I swam from\nthere round the beacon and landed at the creek of Tarumi. It's over\nthree miles and it's rather difficult on account of the currents round\nthe beacon. Well, I told my young namesake about it and I said to him\nthat if he'd do it I'd give him a job.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I could see he was rather taken aback.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You say you're a swimmer,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I'm not in very good condition,' he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't say anything. I shrugged my shoulders. He looked at me for a\nmoment and then he nodded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'All right,' he said. 'When do you want me to do it?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I looked at my watch. It was just after ten.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'The swim shouldn't take you much over an hour and a quarter. I'll\ndrive round to the creek at half-past twelve and meet you. I'll take you\nback to the club to dress and then we'll have lunch together.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Done,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We shook hands. I wished him good luck and he left me. I had a lot of\nwork to do that morning and I only just managed to get to the creek at\nTarumi at half-past twelve. But I needn't have hurried; he never turned\nup.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did he funk it at the last moment?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, he didn't funk it. He started all right. But of course he'd ruined\nhis constitution by drink and dissipation. The currents round the beacon\nwere more than he could manage. We didn't get the body for about three\ndays.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI didn't say anything for a moment or two. I was a trifle shocked. Then\nI asked Burton a question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When you made him that offer of a job, did you know he'd be drowned?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave a little mild chuckle and he looked at me with those kind and\ncandid blue eyes of his. He rubbed his chin with his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I hadn't got a vacancy in my office at the moment.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI like Elsom. It is a seaside resort in the South of England, not very\nfar from Brighton, and it has something of the late Georgian charm of\nthat agreeable town. But it is neither bustling nor garish. Ten years\nago, when I used to go there not infrequently, you might still see here\nand there an old house, solid and pretentious in no unpleasing fashion\n(like a decayed gentlewoman of good family whose discreet pride in her\nancestry amuses rather than offends you), which was built in the reign\nof the First Gentleman in Europe and where a courtier of fallen fortunes\nmay well have passed his declining years. The main street had a\nlackadaisical air and the doctor's motor seemed a trifle out of place.\nThe housewives did their housekeeping in a leisurely manner. They\ngossiped with the butcher as they watched him cut from his great joint\nof South Down a piece of the best end of the neck, and they asked\namiably after the grocer's wife as he put half a pound of tea and a\npacket of salt into their string bag. I do not know whether Elsom was\never fashionable: it certainly was not so then; but it was respectable\nand cheap. Elderly ladies, maiden and widowed, lived there, Indian\nCivilians and retired soldiers: they looked forward with little shudders\nof dismay to August and September which would bring holiday-makers; but\ndid not disdain to let them their houses and on the proceeds spend a few\nworldly weeks in a Swiss pension. I never knew Elsom at that hectic time\nwhen the lodging-houses were full and young men in blazers sauntered\nalong the front, when Pierrots performed on the beach and in the\nbilliard-room at the Dolphin you heard the click of balls till eleven at\nnight. I only knew it in winter. Then in every house on the sea-front,\nstucco houses with bow-windows built a hundred years ago, there was a\nsign to inform you that apartments were to let; and the guests of the\nDolphin were waited on by a single waiter and the boots. At ten o'clock\nthe porter came into the smoking-room and looked at you in so marked a\nmanner that you got up and went to bed. Then Elsom was a restful place\nand the Dolphin a very comfortable inn. It was pleasing to think that\nthe Prince Regent drove over with Mrs. Fitzherbert more than once to\ndrink a dish of tea in its coffee-room. In the hall was a framed letter\nfrom Mr. Thackeray ordering a sitting-room and two bedrooms overlooking\nthe sea and giving instructions that a fly should be sent to the station\nto meet him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne November, two or three years after the war, having had a bad attack\nof influenza, I went down to Elsom to regain my strength. I arrived in\nthe afternoon and when I had unpacked my things went for a stroll on the\nfront. The sky was overcast and the calm sea grey and cold. A few\nseagulls flew close to the shore. Sailing-boats, their masts taken down\nfor the winter, were drawn up high on the shingly beach and the\nbathing-huts stood side by side in a long, grey and tattered row. No one\nwas sitting on the benches that the town council had put here and there,\nbut a few people were trudging up and down for exercise. I passed an old\ncolonel with a red nose who stamped along in plus-fours followed by a\nterrier, two elderly women in short skirts and stout shoes and a plain\ngirl in a tam-o'-shanter. I had never seen the front so deserted. The\nlodging-houses looked like bedraggled old maids waiting for lovers who\nwould never return, and even the friendly Dolphin seemed wan and\ndesolate. My heart sank. Life on a sudden seemed very drab. I returned\nto the hotel, drew the curtains of my sitting-room, poked the fire and\nwith a book sought to dispel my melancholy. But I was glad enough when\nit was time to dress for dinner. I went into the coffee-room and found\nthe guests of the hotel already seated. I gave them a casual glance.\nThere was one lady of middle age by herself and there were two elderly\ngentlemen, golfers probably, with red faces and baldish heads, who ate\ntheir food in moody silence. The only other persons in the room were a\ngroup of three who sat in the bow-window, and they immediately attracted\nmy surprised attention. The party consisted of an old gentleman and two\nladies, one of whom was old and probably his wife, while the other was\nyounger and possibly his daughter. It was the old lady who first excited\nmy interest. She wore a voluminous dress of black silk and a black lace\ncap; on her wrists were heavy gold bangles and round her neck a\nsubstantial gold chain from which hung a large gold locket; at her neck\nwas a large gold brooch. I did not know that anyone still wore jewellery\nof that sort. Often, passing second-hand jewellers and pawnbrokers, I\nhad lingered for a moment to look at these strangely old-fashioned\narticles, so solid, costly and hideous, and thought, with a smile in\nwhich there was a tinge of sadness, of the women long since dead who had\nworn them. They suggested the period when the bustle and the flounce\nwere taking the place of the crinoline and the pork-pie hat was ousting\nthe poke-bonnet. The British people liked things solid and good in those\ndays. They went to church on Sunday morning and after church walked in\nthe Park. They gave dinner-parties of twelve courses where the master of\nthe house carved the beef and the chickens, and after dinner the ladies\nwho could play favoured the company with Mendelssohn's <i>Songs Without\nWords</i> and the gentleman with the fine baritone voice sang an old\nEnglish ballad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe younger woman had her back turned to me and at first I could see\nonly that she had a slim and youthful figure. She had a great deal of\nbrown hair which seemed to be elaborately arranged. She wore a grey\ndress. The three of them were chatting in low tones and presently she\nturned her head so that I saw her profile. It was astonishingly\nbeautiful. The nose was straight and delicate, the line of the cheek\nexquisitely modelled; I saw then that she wore her hair after the manner\nof Queen Alexandra. The dinner proceeded to its close and the party got\nup. The old lady sailed out of the room, looking neither to the right\nnor to the left, and the young one followed her. Then I saw with a shock\nthat she was old. Her frock was simple enough, the skirt was longer than\nwas at that time worn, and there was something slightly old-fashioned in\nthe cut, I dare say the waist was more clearly indicated than was then\nusual, but it was a girl's frock. She was tall, like a heroine of\nTennyson's, slight, with long legs and a graceful carriage. I had seen\nthe nose before, it was the nose of a Greek goddess, her mouth was\nbeautiful, and her eyes were large and blue. Her skin was of course a\nlittle tight on the bones and there were wrinkles on her forehead and\nabout her eyes, but in youth it must have been lovely. She reminded you\nof those Roman ladies with features of an exquisite regularity whom\nAlma-Tadema used to paint, but who, notwithstanding their antique dress,\nwere so stubbornly English. It was a type of cold perfection that one\nhad not seen for five-and-twenty years. Now it is as dead as the\nepigram. I was like an archæologist who finds some long-buried statue\nand I was thrilled in so unexpected a manner to hit upon this survival\nof a past era. For no day is so dead as the day before yesterday.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe gentleman rose to his feet when the two ladies left, and then\nresumed his chair. A waiter brought him a glass of heavy port. He smelt\nit, sipped it, and rolled it round his tongue. I observed him. He was a\nlittle man, much shorter than his imposing wife, well-covered without\nbeing stout, with a fine head of curling grey hair. His face was much\nwrinkled and it bore a faintly humorous expression. His lips were tight\nand his chin was square. He was, according to our present notions,\nsomewhat extravagantly dressed. He wore a black velvet jacket, a frilled\nshirt with a low collar and a large black tie, and very wide evening\ntrousers. It gave you vaguely the effect of costume. Having drunk his\nport with deliberation, he got up and sauntered out of the room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen I passed through the hall, curious to know who these singular\npeople were, I glanced at the visitors' book. I saw written in an\nangular feminine hand, the writing that was taught to young ladies in\nmodish schools forty years or so ago, the names: Mr. and Mrs. Edwin St.\nClair and Miss Porchester. Their address was given as 68, Leinster\nSquare, Bayswater, London. These must be the names and this the address\nof the persons who had so much interested me. I asked the manageress who\nMr. St. Clair was and she told me that she believed he was something in\nthe City. I went into the billiard-room and knocked the balls about for\na little while and then on my way upstairs passed through the lounge.\nThe two red-faced gentlemen were reading the evening paper and the\nelderly lady was dozing over a novel. The party of three sat in a\ncorner. Mrs. St. Clair was knitting, Miss Porchester was busy with\nembroidery, and Mr. St. Clair was reading aloud in a discreet but\nresonant tone. As I passed I discovered that he was reading <i>Bleak\nHouse</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI read and wrote most of the next day, but in the afternoon I went for a\nwalk and on my way home I sat down for a little on one of those\nconvenient benches on the sea-front. It was not quite so cold as the day\nbefore and the air was pleasant. For want of anything better to do I\nwatched a figure advancing towards me from a distance. It was a man and\nas he came nearer I saw that it was rather a shabby little man. He wore\na thin black greatcoat and a somewhat battered bowler. He walked with\nhis hands in his pockets and looked cold. He gave me a glance as he\npassed by, went on a few steps, hesitated, stopped and turned back. When\nhe came up once more to the bench on which I sat he took a hand out of\nhis pocket and touched his hat. I noticed that he wore shabby black\ngloves, and surmised that he was a widower in straitened circumstances.\nOr he might have been a mute recovering, like myself, from influenza.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" he said, \"but could you oblige me with a match?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Certainly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sat down beside me and while I put my hand in my pocket for matches\nhe hunted in his for cigarettes. He took out a small packet of Gold\nFlake and his face fell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Dear, dear, how very annoying! I haven't got a cigarette left.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me offer you one,\" I replied, smiling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI took out my case and he helped himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gold?\" he asked, giving the case a tap as I closed it. \"Gold? That's a\nthing I never could keep. I've had three. All stolen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis eyes rested in a melancholy way on his boots, which were sadly in\nneed of repair. He was a wizened little man with a long thin nose and\npale-blue eyes. His skin was sallow and he was much lined. I could not\ntell what his age was; he might have been five-and-thirty or he might\nhave been sixty. There was nothing remarkable about him except his\ninsignificance. But though evidently poor he was neat and clean. He was\nrespectable and he clung to respectability. No, I did not think he was a\nmute, I thought he was a solicitor's clerk who had lately buried his\nwife and been sent to Elsom by an indulgent employer to get over the\nfirst shock of his grief.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you making a long stay, sir?\" he asked me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ten days or a fortnight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is this your first visit to Elsom, sir?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have been here before.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know it well, sir. I flatter myself there are very few seaside\nresorts that I have not been to at one time or another. Elsom is hard to\nbeat, sir. You get a very nice class of people here. There's nothing\nnoisy or vulgar about Elsom, if you understand what I mean. Elsom has\nvery pleasant recollections for me, sir. I knew Elsom well in bygone\ndays. I was married in St. Martin's Church, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Really,\" I said feebly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was a very happy marriage, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm very glad to hear it,\" I returned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nine months, that one lasted,\" he said reflectively.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSurely the remark was a trifle singular. I had not looked forward with\nany enthusiasm to the probability which I so clearly foresaw that he\nwould favour me with an account of his matrimonial experiences, but now\nI waited if not with eagerness at least with curiosity for a further\nobservation. He made none. He sighed a little. At last I broke the\nsilence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There don't seem to be very many people about,\" I remarked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I like it so. I'm not one for crowds. As I was saying just now, I\nreckon I've spent a good many years at one seaside resort after the\nother, but I never came in the season. It's the winter I like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you find it a little melancholy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned towards me and placed his black-gloved hand for an instant on\nmy arm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is melancholy. And because it's melancholy a little ray of sunshine\nis very welcome.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe remark seemed to me perfectly idiotic and I did not answer. He\nwithdrew his hand from my arm and got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I mustn't keep you, sir. Pleased to have made your acquaintance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took off his dingy hat very politely and strolled away. It was\nbeginning now to grow chilly and I thought I would return to the\nDolphin. As I reached its broad steps a landau drove up, drawn by two\nscraggy horses, and from it stepped Mr. St. Clair. He wore a hat that\nlooked like the unhappy result of a union between a bowler and a\ntop-hat. He gave his hand to his wife and then to his niece. The porter\ncarried in after them rugs and cushions. As Mr. St. Clair paid the\ndriver I heard him tell him to come at the usual time next day and I\nunderstood that the St. Clairs took a drive every afternoon in a landau.\nIt would not have surprised me to learn that none of them had ever been\nin a motor-car.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe manageress told me that they kept very much to themselves and sought\nno acquaintance among the other persons staying at the hotel. I rode my\nimagination on a loose rein. I watched them eat three meals a day. I\nwatched Mr. and Mrs. St. Clair sit at the top of the hotel steps in the\nmorning. He read <i>The Times</i> and she knitted. I suppose Mrs. St. Clair\nhad never read a paper in her life, for they never took anything but\n<i>The Times</i> and Mr. St. Clair of course took it with him every day to\nthe City. At about twelve Miss Porchester joined them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you enjoyed your walk, Eleanor?\" asked Mrs. St. Clair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was very nice, Aunt Gertrude,\" answered Miss Porchester.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd I understood that just as Mrs. St. Clair took \"her drive\" every\nafternoon Miss Porchester took \"her walk\" every morning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When you have come to the end of your row, my dear,\" said Mr. St.\nClair, with a glance at his wife's knitting, \"we might go for a\nconstitutional before luncheon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That will be very nice,\" answered Mrs. St. Clair. She folded up her\nwork and gave it to Miss Porchester. \"If you're going upstairs, Eleanor,\nwill you take my work?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Certainly, Aunt Gertrude.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say you're a little tired after your walk, my dear.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall have a little rest before luncheon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Porchester went into the hotel and Mr. and Mrs. St. Clair walked\nslowly along the sea-front, side by side, to a certain point, and then\nwalked slowly back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen I met one of them on the stairs I bowed and received an unsmiling,\npolite bow in return, and in the morning I ventured upon a good-day, but\nthere the matter ended. It looked as though I should never have a chance\nto speak to any of them. But presently I thought that Mr. St. Clair gave\nme now and then a glance, and thinking he had heard my name I imagined,\nperhaps vainly, that he looked at me with curiosity. And a day or two\nafter that I was sitting in my room when the porter came in with a\nmessage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. St. Clair presents his compliments and could you oblige him with\nthe loan of <i>Whitaker's Almanack</i>.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was astonished.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why on earth should he think that I have a <i>Whitaker's Almanack</i>?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, sir, the manageress told him you wrote.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI could not see the connection.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell Mr. St. Clair that I'm very sorry that I haven't got a <i>Whitaker's\nAlmanack</i>, but if I had I would very gladly lend it to him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHere was my opportunity. I was by now filled with eagerness to know\nthese fantastic persons more closely. Now and then in the heart of Asia\nI have come upon a lonely tribe living in a little village among an\nalien population. No one knows how they came there or why they settled\nin that spot. They live their own lives, speak their own language, and\nhave no communication with their neighbours. No one knows whether they\nare the descendants of a band that was left behind when their nation\nswept in a vast horde across the continent or whether they are the dying\nremnant of some great people that in that country once held empire. They\nare a mystery. They have no future and no history. This odd little\nfamily seemed to me to have something of the same character. They were\nof an era that is dead and gone. They reminded me of persons in one of\nthose leisurely, old-fashioned novels that one's father read. They\nbelonged to the 'eighties and they had not moved since then. How\nextraordinary it was that they could have lived through the last forty\nyears as though the world stood still! They took me back to my childhood\nand I recollected people who are long since dead. I wonder if it is only\ndistance that gives me the impression that they were more peculiar than\nanyone is now. When a person was described then as \"quite a character\",\nby heaven, it meant something.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo that evening after dinner I went into the lounge and boldly addressed\nMr. St. Clair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm so sorry I haven't got a <i>Whitaker's Almanack</i>,\" I said, \"but if I\nhave any other book that can be of service to you I shall be delighted\nto lend it to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. St. Clair was obviously startled. The two ladies kept their eyes on\ntheir work. There was an embarrassed hush.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It does not matter at all, but I was given to understand by the\nmanageress that you were a novelist.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI racked my brain. There was evidently some connection between my\nprofession and <i>Whitaker's Almanack</i> that escaped me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In days gone by Mr. Trollope used often to dine with us in Leinster\nSquare and I remember him saying that the two most useful books to a\nnovelist were the Bible and <i>Whitaker's Almanack</i>.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see that Thackeray once stayed in this hotel,\" I remarked, anxious\nnot to let the conversation drop.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never very much cared for Mr. Thackeray, though he dined more than\nonce with my wife's father, the late Mr. Sargeant Saunders. He was too\ncynical for me. My niece has not read <i>Vanity Fair</i> to this day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Porchester blushed slightly at this reference to herself. A waiter\nbrought in the coffee and Mrs. St. Clair turned to her husband.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps, my dear, this gentleman would do us the pleasure to have his\ncoffee with us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlthough not directly addressed I answered promptly:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you very much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI sat down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Trollope was always my favourite novelist,\" said Mr. St. Clair. \"He\nwas so essentially a gentleman. I admire Charles Dickens. But Charles\nDickens could never draw a gentleman. I am given to understand that\nyoung people nowadays find Mr. Trollope a little slow. My niece, Miss\nPorchester, prefers the novels of Mr. William Black.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I've never read any,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, I see that you are like me; you are not up to date. My niece once\npersuaded me to read a novel by a Miss Rhoda Broughton, but I could not\nmanage more than a hundred pages of it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I did not say I liked it, Uncle Edwin,\" said Miss Porchester, defending\nherself, with another blush, \"I told you it was rather fast, but\neverybody was talking about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm quite sure it is not the sort of book your Aunt Gertrude would have\nwished you to read, Eleanor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I remember Miss Broughton telling me once that when she was young\npeople said her books were fast and when she was old they said they were\nslow, and it was very hard since she had written exactly the same sort\nof book for forty years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, did you know Miss Broughton?\" asked Miss Porchester, addressing me\nfor the first time. \"How very interesting! And did you know Ouida?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear Eleanor, what will you say next! I'm quite sure you've never\nread anything by Ouida.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Indeed, I have, Uncle Edwin. I've read <i>Under Two Flags</i> and I liked it\nvery much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You amaze and shock me. I don't know what girls are coming to\nnowadays.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You always said that when I was thirty you gave me complete liberty to\nread anything I liked.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is a difference, my dear Eleanor, between liberty and licence,\"\nsaid Mr. St. Clair, smiling a little in order not to make his reproof\noffensive, but with a certain gravity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI do not know if in recounting this conversation I have managed to\nconvey the impression it gave me of a charming and old-fashioned air. I\ncould have listened all night to them discussing the depravity of an age\nthat was young in the eighteen-eighties. I would have given a good deal\nfor a glimpse of their large and roomy house in Leinster Square. I\nshould have recognised the suite covered in red brocade that stood\nstiffly about the drawing-room, each piece in its appointed place; and\nthe cabinets filled with Dresden china would have brought me back my\nchildhood. In the dining-room, where they habitually sat, for the\ndrawing-room was used only for parties, was a Turkey carpet and a vast\nmahogany sideboard \"groaning\" with silver. On the walls were the\npictures that had excited the admiration of Mrs. Humphrey Ward and her\nuncle Matthew in the Academy of eighteen-eighty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext morning, strolling through a pretty lane at the back of Elsom, I\nmet Miss Porchester, who was taking \"her walk\". I should have liked to\ngo a little way with her, but felt certain that it would embarrass this\nmaiden of fifty to saunter alone with a man even of my respectable\nyears. She bowed as I passed her and blushed. Oddly enough, a few yards\nbehind her I came upon the funny shabby little man in black gloves with\nwhom I had spoken for a few minutes on the front. He touched his old\nbowler hat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Excuse me, sir, but could you oblige me with a match?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Certainly,\" I retorted, \"but I'm afraid I have no cigarettes on me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Allow me to offer you one of mine,\" he said, taking out the paper case.\nIt was empty. \"Dear, dear, I haven't got one either. What a curious\ncoincidence!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went on and I had a notion that he a little hastened his steps. I was\nbeginning to have my doubts about him. I hoped he was not going to\nbother Miss Porchester. For a moment I thought of walking back, but I\ndid not. He was a civil little man and I did not believe he would make a\nnuisance of himself to a single lady.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI saw him again that very afternoon. I was sitting on the front. He\nwalked towards me with little, halting steps. There was something of a\nwind and he looked like a dried leaf being driven before it. This time\nhe did not hesitate, but sat down beside me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We meet again, sir. The world is a small place. If it will not\ninconvenience you perhaps you will allow me to rest a few minutes. I am\na wee bit tired.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is a public bench, and you have just as much right to sit on it as\nI.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not wait for him to ask me for a match, but at once offered him a\ncigarette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How very kind of you, sir! I have to limit myself to so many cigarettes\na day, but I enjoy those I smoke. As one grows older the pleasures of\nlife diminish, but my experience is that one enjoys more those that\nremain.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is a very consoling thought.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Excuse me, sir, but am I right in thinking that you are the well-known\nauthor?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am an author,\" I replied. \"But what made you think it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have seen your portrait in the illustrated papers. I suppose you\ndon't recognise me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI looked at him again, a weedy little man in neat but shabby black\nclothes, with a long nose and watery blue eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I don't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say I've changed,\" he sighed. \"There was a time when my\nphotograph was in every paper in the United Kingdom. Of course, those\npress photographs never do you justice. I give you my word, sir, that if\nI hadn't seen my name underneath I should never have guessed that some\nof them were meant for me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was silent for a while. The tide was out and beyond the shingle of\nthe beach was a strip of yellow mud. The breakwaters were half buried in\nit like the backbones of prehistoric beasts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must be a wonderfully interesting thing to be an author, sir. I've\noften thought I had quite a turn for writing myself. At one time and\nanother I've done a rare lot of reading. I haven't kept up with it much\nlately. For one thing my eyes are not so good as they used to be. I\nbelieve I could write a book if I tried.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They say anybody can write one,\" I answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not a novel, you know. I'm not much of a one for novels; I prefer\nhistories and that-like. But memoirs. If anybody was to make it worth my\nwhile I wouldn't mind writing my memoirs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's very fashionable just now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There are not many people who've had the experiences I've had in one\nway and another. I did write to one of the Sunday papers about it some\nlittle while back, but they never answered my letter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave me a long, appraising look. He had too respectable an air to be\nabout to ask me for half a crown.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course you don't know who I am, sir, do you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I honestly don't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe seemed to ponder for a moment, then he smoothed down his black gloves\non his fingers, looked for a moment at a hole in one of them, and then\nturned to me not without self-consciousness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am the celebrated Mortimer Ellis,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not know what other ejaculation to make, for to the best of my\nbelief I had never heard the name before. I saw a look of disappointment\ncome over his face, and I was a trifle embarrassed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mortimer Ellis,\" he repeated. \"You're not going to tell me you don't\nknow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I must. I'm very often out of England.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI wondered to what he owed his celebrity. I passed over in my mind\nvarious possibilities. He could never have been an athlete, which alone\nin England gives a man real fame, but he might have been a faith-healer\nor a champion billiard-player. There is of course no one so obscure as a\nCabinet Minister out of office and he might have been the President of\nthe Board of Trade in a defunct administration. But he had none of the\nlook of a politician.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's fame for you,\" he said bitterly. \"Why, for weeks I was the most\ntalked-about man in England. Look at me. You must have seen my\nphotograph in the papers. Mortimer Ellis.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, shaking my head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe paused a moment to give his disclosure effectiveness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am the well-known bigamist.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow what are you to reply when a person who is practically a stranger to\nyou informs you that he is a well-known bigamist? I will confess that I\nhave sometimes had the vanity to think that I am not as a rule at a loss\nfor a retort, but here I found myself speechless.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've had eleven wives, sir,\" he went on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Most people find one about as much as they can manage.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, that's want of practice. When you've had eleven there's very little\nyou don't know about women.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But why did you stop at eleven?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There now, I knew you'd say that. The moment I set eyes on you I said\nto myself, he's got a clever face. You know, sir, that's the thing that\nalways grizzles me. Eleven does seem a funny number, doesn't it? There's\nsomething unfinished about it. Now three anyone might have, and seven's\nall right, they say nine's lucky, and there's nothing wrong with ten.\nBut eleven! That's the one thing I regret. I shouldn't have minded\nanything if I could have brought it up to the Round Dozen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe unbuttoned his coat and from an inside pocket produced a bulging and\nvery greasy pocket-book. From this he took a large bundle of newspaper\ncuttings; they were worn and creased and dirty. But he spread out two or\nthree.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now just you look at those photographs. I ask you, are they like me?\nIt's an outrage. Why, you'd think I was a criminal to look at them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe cuttings were of imposing length. In the opinion of sub-editors\nMortimer Ellis had obviously been a news item of value. One was headed,\nA Much Married Man; another, Heartless Ruffian Brought to Book; a third,\nContemptible Scoundrel Meets his Waterloo.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not what you would call a good press,\" I murmured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never pay any attention to what the newspapers say,\" he answered,\nwith a shrug of his thin shoulders. \"I've known too many journalists\nmyself for that. No, it's the judge I blame. He treated me shocking and\nit did him no good, mind you; he died within the year.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI ran my eyes down the report I held.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see he gave you five years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Disgraceful, I call it, and see what it says.\" He pointed to a place\nwith his forefinger. \"'Three of his victims pleaded for mercy to be\nshown to him.' That shows what they thought of me. And after that he\ngave me five years. And just look what he called me, a heartless\nscoundrel--me, the best-hearted man that ever lived--a pest of society\nand a danger to the public. Said he wished he had the power to give me\nthe cat. I don't so much mind his giving me five years, though you'll\nnever get me to say it wasn't excessive, but I ask you, had he the right\nto talk to me like that? No, he hadn't, and I'll never forgive him, not\nif I live to be a hundred.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe bigamist's cheeks flushed and his watery eyes were filled for a\nmoment with fire. It was a sore subject with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"May I read them?\" I asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's what I gave them you for. I want you to read them, sir. And if\nyou can read them without saying that I'm a much wronged man, well,\nyou're not the man I took you for.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs I glanced through one cutting after another I saw why Mortimer Ellis\nhad so wide an acquaintance with the seaside resorts of England. They\nwere his hunting-ground. His method was to go to some place when the\nseason was over and take apartments in one of the empty lodging-houses.\nApparently it did not take him long to make acquaintance with some woman\nor other, widow or spinster, and I noticed that their ages at the time\nwere between thirty-five and fifty. They stated in the witness-box that\nthey had met him first on the sea-front. He generally proposed marriage\nto them within a fortnight of this and they were married shortly after.\nHe induced them in one way or another to entrust him with their savings\nand in a few months, on the pretext that he had to go to London on\nbusiness, he left them never to return. Only one had ever seen him again\ntill, obliged to give evidence, they saw him in the dock. They were\nwomen of a certain respectability; one was the daughter of a doctor and\nanother of a clergyman; there was a lodging-house keeper, there was the\nwidow of a commercial traveller, and there was a retired dressmaker. For\nthe most part, their fortunes ranged from five hundred to a thousand\npounds, but whatever the sum the misguided women were stripped of every\npenny. Some of them told really pitiful stories of the destitution to\nwhich they had been reduced. But they all acknowledged that he had been\na good husband to them. Not only had three actually pleaded for mercy to\nbe shown him, but one said in the witness-box that, if he was willing to\ncome, she was ready to take him back. He noticed that I was reading\nthis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And she'd have worked for me,\" he said, \"there's no doubt about that.\nBut I said, better let bygones be bygones. No one likes a cut off the\nbest end of the neck better than I do, but I'm not much of a one for\ncold roast mutton, I will confess.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was only by an accident that Mortimer Ellis did not marry his twelfth\nwife and so achieve the Round Dozen which I understand appealed to his\nlove of symmetry. For he was engaged to be married to a Miss\nHubbard--\"two thousand pounds she had, if she had a penny, in war-loan,\"\nhe confided to me--and the banns had been read, when one of his former\nwives saw him, made enquiries, and communicated with the police. He was\narrested on the very day before his twelfth wedding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was a bad one, she was,\" he told me. \"She deceived me something\ncruel.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did she do that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I met her at Eastbourne, one December it was, on the pier, and\nshe told me in course of conversation that she'd been in the millinery\nbusiness and had retired. She said she'd made a tidy bit of money. She\nwouldn't say exactly how much it was, but she gave me to understand it\nwas something like fifteen hundred pounds. And when I married her, would\nyou believe it, she hadn't got three hundred. And that's the one who\ngave me away. And mind you, I'd never blamed her. Many a man would have\ncut up rough when he found out he'd been made a fool of. I never showed\nher that I was disappointed even, I just went away without a word.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But not without the three hundred pounds, I take it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh come, sir, you must be reasonable,\" he returned in an injured tone.\n\"You can't expect three hundred pounds to last for ever and I'd been\nmarried to her four months before she confessed the truth.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Forgive my asking,\" I said, \"and pray don't think my question suggests\na disparaging view of your personal attractions, but--why did they marry\nyou?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Because I asked them,\" he answered, evidently very much surprised at my\nenquiry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But did you never have any refusals?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very seldom. Not more than four or five in the whole course of my\ncareer. Of course I didn't propose till I was pretty sure of my ground\nand I don't say I didn't draw a blank sometimes. You can't expect to\nclick every time, if you know what I mean, and I've often wasted several\nweeks making up to a woman before I saw there was nothing doing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI surrendered myself for a time to my reflections. But I noticed\npresently that a broad smile spread over the mobile features of my\nfriend.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I understand what you mean,\" he said. \"It's my appearance that puzzles\nyou. You don't know what it is they see in me. That's what comes of\nreading novels and going to the pictures. You think what women want is\nthe cowboy type, or the romance of old Spain touch, flashing eyes, an\nolive skin, and a beautiful dancer. You make me laugh.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm glad,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you a married man, sir?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am. But I only have one wife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't judge by that. You can't generalise from a single instance,\nif you know what I mean. Now, I ask you, what would you know about dogs\nif you'd never had anything but one bull-terrier?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe question was rhetorical and I felt sure did not require an answer.\nHe paused for an effective moment and went on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're wrong, sir. You're quite wrong. They may take a fancy to a\ngood-looking young fellow, but they don't want to marry him. They don't\nreally care about looks.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Douglas Jerrold, who was as ugly as he was witty, used to say that if\nhe was given ten minutes' start with a woman he could cut out the\nhandsomest man in the room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They don't want wit. They don't want a man to be funny; they think he's\nnot serious. They don't want a man who's too handsome; they think he's\nnot serious either. That's what they want, they want a man who's\nserious. Safety first. And then--attention. I may not be handsome and I\nmay not be amusing, but believe me, I've got what every woman wants.\nPoise. And the proof is, I've made every one of my wives happy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It certainly is much to your credit that three of them pleaded for\nmercy to be shown to you and that one was willing to take you back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't know what an anxiety that was to me all the time I was in\nprison. I thought she'd be waiting for me at the gate when I was\nreleased and I said to the Governor: For God's sake, sir, smuggle me out\nso as no one can see me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe smoothed his gloves again over his hands and his eye once more fell\nupon the hole to the first finger.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's what comes of living in lodgings, sir. How's a man to keep\nhimself neat and tidy without a woman to look after him? I've been\nmarried too often to be able to get along without a wife. There are men\nwho don't like being married. I can't understand them. The fact is, you\ncan't do a thing really well unless you've got your heart in it, and I\nlike being a married man. It's no difficulty to me to do the little\nthings that women like and that some men can't be bothered with. As I\nwas saying just now, it's attention a woman wants. I never went out of\nthe house without giving my wife a kiss and I never came in without\ngiving her another. And it was very seldom I came in without bringing\nher some chocolates or a few flowers. I never grudged the expense.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After all, it was her money you were spending,\" I interposed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what if it was? It's not the money that you've paid for a present\nthat signifies, it's the spirit you give it in. That's what counts with\nwomen. No, I'm not one to boast, but I will say this of myself, I am a\ngood husband.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI looked desultorily at the reports of the trial which I still held.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll tell you what surprises me,\" I said. \"All these women were very\nrespectable, of a certain age, quiet, decent persons. And yet they\nmarried you without any enquiry after the shortest possible\nacquaintance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put his hand impressively on my arm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, that's what you don't understand, sir. Women have got a craving to\nbe married. It doesn't matter how young they are or how old they are, if\nthey're short or tall, dark or fair, they've all got one thing in\ncommon: they want to be married. And mind you, I married them in church.\nNo woman feels really safe unless she's married in church. You say I'm\nno beauty, well, I never thought I was, but if I had one leg and a hump\non my back I could find any number of women who'd jump at the chance of\nmarrying me. It's a mania with them. It's a disease. Why, there's hardly\none of them who wouldn't have accepted me the second time I saw her only\nI like to make sure of my ground before I commit myself. When it all\ncame out there was a rare to-do because I'd married eleven times. Eleven\ntimes? Why, it's nothing, it's not even a Round Dozen. I could have\nmarried thirty times if I'd wanted to. I give you my word, sir, when I\nconsider my opportunities, I'm astounded at my moderation.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You told me you were very fond of reading history.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, Warren Hastings said that, didn't he? It struck me at the time I\nread it. It seemed to fit me like a glove.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And you never found these constant courtships a trifle monotonous?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, sir, I think I've got a logical mind, and it always gave me a\nrare lot of pleasure to see how the same effects followed on the same\ncauses, if you know what I mean. Now, for instance, with a woman who'd\nnever been married before I always passed myself off as a widower. It\nworked like a charm. You see, a spinster likes a man who knows a thing\nor two. But with a widow I always said I was a bachelor: a widow's\nafraid a man who's been married before knows too much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI gave him back his cuttings; he folded them up neatly and replaced them\nin his greasy pocket-book.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, sir, I always think I've been misjudged. Just see what they\nsay about me: a pest of society, unscrupulous villain, contemptible\nscoundrel. Now just look at me. I ask you, do I look that sort of man?\nYou know me, you're a judge of character, I've told you all about\nmyself; do you think me a bad man?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My acquaintance with you is very slight,\" I answered with what I\nthought considerable tact.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder if the judge, I wonder if the jury, I wonder if the public\never thought about my side of the question. The public booed me when I\nwas taken into the court and the police had to protect me from their\nviolence. Did any of them think what I'd done for these women?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You took their money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I took their money. I had to live the same as anybody has to\nlive. But what did I give them in exchange for their money?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis was another rhetorical question and though he looked at me as\nthough he expected an answer I held my tongue. Indeed I did not know the\nanswer. His voice was raised and he spoke with emphasis. I could see\nthat he was serious.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll tell you what I gave them in exchange for their money. Romance.\nLook at this place.\" He made a wide, circular gesture that embraced the\nsea and the horizon. \"There are a hundred places in England like this.\nLook at that sea and that sky; look at these lodging-houses; look at\nthat pier and the front. Doesn't it make your heart sink? It's dead as\nmutton. It's all very well for you who come down here for a week or two\nbecause you're run down. But think of all those women who live here from\none year's end to another. They haven't a chance. They hardly know\nanyone. They've just got enough money to live on and that's all. I\nwonder if you know how terrible their lives are. Their lives are just\nlike the front, a long, straight, cemented walk that goes on and on from\none seaside resort to another. Even in the season there's nothing for\nthem. They're out of it. They might as well be dead. And then I come\nalong. Mind you, I never made advances to a woman who wouldn't have\ngladly acknowledged to thirty-five. And I give them love. Why, many of\nthem had never known what it was to have a man do them up behind. Many\nof them had never known what it was to sit on a bench in the dark with a\nman's arm round their waist. I bring them change and excitement. I give\nthem a new pride in themselves. They were on the shelf and I come along\nquite quietly and I deliberately take them down. A little ray of\nsunshine in those drab lives, that's what I was. No wonder they jumped\nat me, no wonder they wanted me to go back to them. The only one who\ngave me away was the milliner; she said she was a widow, my private\nopinion is that she'd never been married at all. You say I did the dirty\non them; why, I brought happiness and glamour into eleven lives that\nnever thought they had even a dog's chance of it again. You say I'm a\nvillain and a scoundrel, you're wrong. I'm a philanthropist. Five years,\nthey gave me; they should have given me the medal of the Royal Humane\nSociety.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took out his empty packet of Gold Flake and looked at it with a\nmelancholy shake of the head. When I handed him my cigarette-case he\nhelped himself without a word. I watched the spectacle of a good man\nstruggling with his emotion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what did I get out of it, I ask you?\" he continued presently.\n\"Board and lodging and enough to buy cigarettes. But I never was able to\nsave, and the proof is that now, when I'm not so young as I was, I\nhaven't got half a crown in my pocket.\" He gave me a sidelong glance.\n\"It's a great come-down for me to find myself in this position. I've\nalways paid my way and I've never asked a friend for a loan in all my\nlife. I was wondering, sir, if you could oblige me with a trifle. It's\nhumiliating to me to have to suggest it, but the fact is, if you could\noblige me with a pound it would mean a great deal to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWell, I had certainly had a pound's worth of entertainment out of the\nbigamist and I dived for my pocket-book.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall be very glad,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at the notes I took out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you couldn't make it two, sir?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I could.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI handed him a couple of pound notes and he gave a little sigh as he\ntook them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't know what it means to a man who's used to the comforts of\nhome life not to know where to turn for a night's lodging.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But there is one thing I should like you to tell me,\" I said. \"I\nshouldn't like you to think me cynical, but I had a notion that women on\nthe whole take the maxim, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive,'\nas applicable exclusively to our sex. How did you persuade these\nrespectable, and no doubt thrifty, women to entrust you so confidently\nwith all their savings?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAn amused smile spread over his undistinguished features.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, sir, you know what Shakespeare said about ambition o'erleaping\nitself. That's the explanation. Tell a woman you'll double her capital\nin six months if she'll give it you to handle and she won't be able to\ngive you the money quick enough. Greed, that's what it is. Just greed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a sharp sensation, stimulating to the appetite (like hot sauce\nwith ice-cream), to go from this diverting ruffian to the\nrespectability, all lavender bags and crinolines, of the St. Clairs and\nMiss Porchester. I spent every evening with them now. No sooner had the\nladies left him than Mr. St. Clair sent his compliments to my table and\nasked me to drink a glass of port with him. When we had finished it we\nwent into the lounge and drank coffee. Mr. St. Clair enjoyed his glass\nof old brandy. The hour I thus spent with them was so exquisitely boring\nthat it had for me a singular fascination. They were told by the\nmanageress that I had written plays.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We used often to go to the theatre when Sir Henry Irving was at the\nLyceum,\" said Mr. St. Clair. \"I once had the pleasure of meeting him. I\nwas taken to supper at the Garrick Club by Sir Everard Millais and I was\nintroduced to Mr. Irving, as he then was.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell him what he said to you, Edwin,\" said Mrs. St. Clair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. St. Clair struck a dramatic attitude and gave not at all a bad\nimitation of Henry Irving.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You have the actor's face, Mr. St. Clair,' he said to me. 'If you ever\nthink of going on the stage, come to me and I will give you a part.'\"\nMr. St. Clair resumed his natural manner. \"It was enough to turn a young\nman's head.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But it didn't turn yours,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will not deny that if I had been otherwise situated I might have\nallowed myself to be tempted. But I had my family to think of. It would\nhave broken my father's heart if I had not gone into the business.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is that?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am a tea merchant, sir. My firm is the oldest in the City of London.\nI have spent forty years of my life in combating to the best of my\nability the desire of my fellow-countrymen to drink Ceylon tea instead\nof the China tea which was universally drunk in my youth.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI thought it charmingly characteristic of him to spend a lifetime in\npersuading the public to buy something they didn't want rather than\nsomething they did.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But in his younger days my husband did a lot of amateur acting and he\nwas thought very clever,\" said Mrs. St. Clair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shakespeare, you know, and sometimes <i>The School for Scandal</i>. I would\nnever consent to act trash. But that is a thing of the past. I had a\ngift, perhaps it was a pity to waste it, but it's too late now. When we\nhave a dinner-party I sometimes let the ladies persuade me to recite the\ngreat soliloquies of Hamlet. But that is all I do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOh! Oh! Oh! I thought with shuddering fascination of those\ndinner-parties and wondered whether I should ever be asked to one of\nthem. Mrs. St. Clair gave me a little smile, half shocked, half prim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My husband was very Bohemian as a young man,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I sowed my wild oats. I knew quite a lot of painters and writers,\nWilkie Collins, for instance, and even men who wrote for the papers.\nWatts painted a portrait of my wife, and I bought a picture of Millais.\nI knew a number of the pre-Raphaelites.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you a Rossetti?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. I admired Rossetti's talent, but I could not approve of his private\nlife. I would never buy a picture by an artist whom I should not care to\nask to dinner at my house.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy brain was reeling when Miss Porchester, looking at her watch, said:\n\"Are you not going to read to us to-night, Uncle Edwin?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI withdrew.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was while I was drinking a glass of port with Mr. St. Clair one\nevening that he told me the sad story of Miss Porchester. She was\nengaged to be married to a nephew of Mrs. St. Clair, a barrister, when\nit was discovered that he had had an intrigue with the daughter of his\nlaundress.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was a terrible thing,\" said Mr. St. Clair. \"A terrible thing. But of\ncourse my niece took the only possible course. She returned him his\nring, his letters and his photograph, and said that she could never\nmarry him. She implored him to marry the young person he had wronged and\nsaid she would be a sister to her. It broke her heart. She has never\ncared for anyone since.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And did he marry the young person?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. St. Clair shook his head and sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, we were greatly mistaken in him. It has been a sore grief to my\ndear wife to think that a nephew of hers should behave in such a\ndishonourable manner. Some time later we heard that he was engaged to a\nyoung lady in a very good position with ten thousand pounds of her own.\nI considered it my duty to write to her father and put the facts before\nhim. He answered my letter in a most insolent fashion. He said he would\nmuch rather his son-in-law had a mistress before marriage than after.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What happened then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They were married and now my wife's nephew is one of His Majesty's\nJudges of the High Court, and his wife is My Lady. But we've never\nconsented to receive them. When my wife's nephew was knighted Eleanor\nsuggested that we should ask them to dinner, but my wife said that he\nshould never darken our doors and I upheld her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And the laundress's daughter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She married in her own class of life and has a public-house at\nCanterbury. My niece, who has a little money of her own, did everything\nfor her and is godmother to her eldest child.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPoor Miss Porchester. She had sacrificed herself on the altar of\nVictorian morality and I am afraid the consciousness that she had\nbehaved beautifully was the only benefit she had got from it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Miss Porchester is a woman of striking appearance,\" I said. \"When she\nwas younger she must have been perfectly lovely. I wonder she never\nmarried somebody else.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Miss Porchester was considered a great beauty. Alma-Tadema admired her\nso much that he asked her to sit as a model for one of his pictures, but\nof course we couldn't very well allow that.\" Mr. St. Clair's tone\nconveyed that the suggestion had deeply outraged his sense of decency.\n\"No, Miss Porchester never cared for anyone but her cousin. She never\nspeaks of him and it is now thirty years since they parted, but I am\nconvinced that she loves him still. She is a true woman, my dear sir,\none life, one love, and though perhaps I regret that she has been\ndeprived of the joys of marriage and motherhood I am bound to admire her\nfidelity.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the heart of woman is incalculable and rash is the man who thinks\nshe will remain in one stay. Rash, Uncle Edwin. You have known Eleanor\nfor many years, for when, her mother having fallen into a decline and\ndied, you brought the orphan to your comfortable and even luxurious\nhouse in Leinster Square, she was but a child; but what, when it comes\ndown to brass tacks, Uncle Edwin, do you really know of Eleanor?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was but two days after Mr. St. Clair had confided to me the touching\nstory which explained why Miss Porchester had remained a spinster that,\ncoming back to the hotel in the afternoon after a round of golf, the\nmanageress came up to me in an agitated manner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. St. Clair's compliments and will you go up to number twenty-seven\nthe moment you come in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Certainly. But why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, there's a rare upset. They'll tell you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI knocked at the door. I heard a \"Come in, come in,\" which reminded me\nthat Mr. St. Clair had played Shakespearean parts in probably the most\nrefined amateur dramatic company in London. I entered and found Mrs. St.\nClair lying on the sofa with a handkerchief soaked in eau-de-Cologne on\nher brow and a bottle of smelling-salts in her hand. Mr. St. Clair was\nstanding in front of the fire in such a manner as to prevent anyone else\nin the room from obtaining any benefit from it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must apologise for asking you to come up in this unceremonious\nfashion, but we are in great distress, and we thought you might be able\nto throw some light on what has happened.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis perturbation was obvious.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What <i>has</i> happened?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Our niece, Miss Porchester, has eloped. This morning she sent in a\nmessage to my wife that she had one of her sick headaches. When she has\none of her sick headaches she likes to be left absolutely alone and it\nwasn't till this afternoon that my wife went to see if there was\nanything she could do for her. The room was empty. Her trunk was packed.\nHer dressing-case with silver fittings was gone. And on the pillow was a\nletter telling us of her rash act.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm very sorry,\" I said. \"I don't know exactly what I can do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We were under the impression that you were the only gentleman at Elsom\nwith whom she had any acquaintance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis meaning flashed across me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't eloped with her,\" I said. \"I happen to be a married man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see you haven't eloped with her. At the first moment we thought\nperhaps... but if it isn't you, who is it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sure I don't know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Show him the letter, Edwin,\" said Mrs. St. Clair from the sofa.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't move, Gertrude. It will bring on your lumbago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Porchester had \"her\" sick headaches and Mrs. St. Clair had; \"her\"\nlumbago. What had Mr. St. Clair? I was willing to bet a fiver that Mr.\nSt. Clair had \"his\" gout. He gave me the letter and I read it with an\nair of decent commiseration.\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <i>Dearest Uncle Edwin and Aunt Gertrude</i>,\n\n<p>\n    <i>When you receive this I shall be far away. I am going to be\n    married this morning to a gentleman who is very dear to me. I\n    know I am doing wrong in running away like this, but I was\n    afraid you would endeavour to set obstacles in the way of my\n    marriage and since nothing would induce me to change my mind I\n    thought it would save us all much unhappiness if I did it\n    without telling you anything about it. My fiancé is a very\n    retiring man, owing to his long residence in tropical countries\n    not in the best of health, and he thought it much better that we\n    should be married quite privately. When you know how radiantly\n    happy I am I hope you will forgive me. Please send my box to the\n    luggage office at Victoria Station.</i>\n</p>\n\n<br>\n    <i>Your loving niece</i>,\n<br>\n    <i>Eleanor</i>.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\"I will never forgive her,\" said Mr. St. Clair as I returned him the\nletter. \"She shall never darken my doors again. Gertrude, I forbid, you\never to mention Eleanor's name in my hearing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. St. Clair began to sob quietly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Aren't you rather hard?\" I said. \"Is there any reason why Miss\nPorchester shouldn't marry?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At her age,\" he answered angrily. \"It's ridiculous. We shall be the\nlaughing-stock of everyone in Leinster Square. Do you know how old she\nis? She's fifty-one.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fifty-four,\" said Mrs. St. Clair through her sobs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's been the apple of my eye. She's been like a daughter to us. She's\nbeen an old maid for years. I think it's positively improper for her to\nthink of marriage.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was always a girl to us, Edwin,\" pleaded Mrs. St. Clair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And who is this man she's married? It's the deception that rankles. She\nmust have been carrying on with him under our very noses. She does not\neven tell us his name. I fear the very worst.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSuddenly I had an inspiration. That morning after breakfast I had gone\nout to buy myself some cigarettes and at the tobacconist's I ran across\nMortimer Ellis. I had not seen him for some days.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're looking very spruce,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis boots had been repaired and were neatly blacked, his hat was\nbrushed, he was wearing a clean collar and new gloves. I thought he had\nlaid out my two pounds to advantage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have to go to London this morning on business,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI nodded and left the shop.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI remembered that a fortnight before, walking in the country, I had met\nMiss Porchester and, a few yards behind, Mortimer Ellis. Was it possible\nthat they had been walking together and he had fallen back as they\ncaught sight of me? By heaven, I saw it all.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think you said that Miss Porchester had money of her own,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A trifle. She has three thousand pounds.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow I was certain. I looked at them blankly. Suddenly Mrs. St. Clair,\nwith a cry, sprang to her feet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Edwin, Edwin, supposing he doesn't marry her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. St. Clair at this put his hand to his head and in a state of\ncollapse sank into a chair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The disgrace would kill me,\" he groaned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" I said. \"He'll marry her all right. He always does.\nHe'll marry her in church.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey paid no attention to what I said. I suppose they thought I'd\nsuddenly taken leave of my senses. I was quite sure now. Mortimer Ellis\nhad achieved his ambition after all. Miss Porchester completed the Round\nDozen.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI seem never to find myself in Rome but at the dead season. I pass\nthrough in August or September on my way somewhere or other and spend a\ncouple of days revisiting places or pictures that are endeared to me by\nold associations. It is very hot then and the inhabitants of the city\nspend their day interminably strolling up and down the Corso. The Caffé\nNazionale is crowded with people sitting at little tables for long hours\nwith an empty cup of coffee in front of them and a glass of water. In\nthe Sistine Chapel you see blond and sunburned Germans, in\nknickerbockers and shirts open at the neck, who have walked down the\ndusty roads of Italy with knapsacks on their shoulders; and in St.\nPeter's little groups of the pious, tired but eager, who have come on\npilgrimage (at an inclusive rate) from some distant country. They are\nunder the charge of a priest and they speak strange tongues. The Hotel\nPlaza then is cool and restful. The public rooms are dark, silent and\nspacious. In the lounge at tea-time the only persons are a young, smart\nofficer and a woman with fine eyes, drinking iced lemonade, and they\ntalk intimately, in low tones, with the unwearying fluency of their\nrace. You go up to your room and read and write letters and come down\nagain two hours later and they are still talking. Before dinner a few\npeople saunter into the bar, but for the rest of the day it is empty and\nthe barman has time to tell you of his mother in Switzerland and his\nexperiences in New York. You discuss life and love and the high cost of\nliquor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd on this occasion too I found that I had the hotel almost to myself.\nWhen the reception clerk took me to my room he told me that they were\npretty full, but when, having bathed and changed, I came down again to\nthe hall, the liftman, an old acquaintance, informed me that there were\nnot more than a dozen people staying there. I was tired after a long and\nhot journey down Italy and had made up my mind to dine quietly in the\nhotel and go to bed early. It was late when I went into the dining-room,\nvast and brightly lit, but not more than three or four tables were\noccupied. I looked round me with satisfaction. It is very agreeable to\nfind yourself alone in a great city which is yet not quite strange to\nyou and in a large empty hotel. It gives you a delectable sense of\nfreedom. I felt the wings of my spirit give a little flutter of delight.\nI had paused for ten minutes in the bar and had a dry Martini. I ordered\nmyself a bottle of good red wine. My limbs were weary, but my soul\nresponded wonderfully to food and drink and I began to feel a singular\nlightness of heart. I ate my soup and my fish and pleasant thoughts\nfilled my mind. Scraps of dialogue occurred to me and my fancy played\nhappily with the persons of a novel I was then at work on. I rolled a\nphrase on my tongue and it tasted better than the wine. I began to think\nof the difficulty of describing the looks of people in such a way as to\nmake the reader see them as you see them. To me it has always been one\nof the most difficult things in fiction. What does the reader really get\nwhen you describe a face feature by feature? I should think nothing. And\nyet the plan some writers adopt of taking a salient characteristic, a\ncrooked smile or shifty eyes, and emphasising that, though effective,\navoids rather than solves the problem. I looked about me and wondered\nhow I would describe the people at the tables round me. There was one\nman by himself just opposite and for practice I asked myself in what way\nI should treat him. He was a tall, spare fellow, and what I believe is\ngenerally called loose-limbed. He wore a dinner jacket and a boiled\nshirt. He had a rather long face and pale eyes; his hair was fairish and\nwavy, but it was growing thin, and the baldness of his temples gave him\na certain nobility of brow. His features were undistinguished. His mouth\nand nose were like everybody else's; he was clean-shaven; his skin was\nnaturally pale, but at the moment sunburned. His appearance suggested an\nintellectual but slightly commonplace distinction. He looked as though\nhe might have been a lawyer or a don who played a pretty game of golf. I\nfelt that he had good taste and was well-read and would be a very\nagreeable guest at a luncheon-party in Chelsea. But how the devil one\nwas to describe him so as in a few lines to give a vivid, interesting\nand accurate picture I could not imagine. Perhaps it would be better to\nlet all the rest go and dwell only on that rather fatigued distinction\nwhich on the whole was the most definite impression he gave. I looked at\nhim reflectively. Suddenly he leaned forwards and gave me a stiff but\ncourtly little bow. I have a ridiculous habit of flushing when I am\ntaken aback and now I felt my cheeks redden. I was startled. I had been\nstaring at him for several minutes as though he were a dummy. He must\nhave thought me extremely rude. I nodded with a good deal of\nembarrassment and looked away. Fortunately at that moment the waiter was\nhanding me a dish. To the best of my belief I had never seen the fellow\nbefore. I asked myself whether his bow was due to my insistent stare,\nwhich made him think that he had met me somewhere, or whether I had\nreally run across him and completely forgotten. I have a bad memory for\nfaces and I had in this case the excuse that he looked exactly like a\ngreat many other people. You saw a dozen of him at every golf course\nround London on a fine Sunday.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe finished his dinner before me. He got up, but on his way out stopped\nat my table. He stretched out his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How d'you do?\" he said. \"I didn't recognise you when you first came in.\nI wasn't meaning to cut you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe spoke in a pleasant voice with the tones cultivated at Oxford and\ncopied by many who have never been there. It was evident that he knew me\nand evident too that he had no notion that I did not also know him. I\nhad risen and since he was a good deal taller than I he looked down on\nme. He held himself with a sort of languor. He stooped a little, which\nadded to the impression he gave me of having about him an air that was\nvaguely apologetic. His manner was a trifle condescending and at the\nsame time a trifle shy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Won't you come and have your coffee with me?\" he said. \"I'm quite\nalone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I shall be glad to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe left me and I still had no notion who he was or where I had met him.\nI had noticed one curious thing about him. Not once during the few\nsentences we exchanged, when we shook hands, or when with a nod he left\nme, did even the suspicion of a smile cross his face. Seeing him more\nclosely I observed that he was in his way good-looking; his features\nwere regular, his grey eyes were handsome, he had a slim figure; but it\nwas a way that I found uninteresting. A silly woman would say he looked\nromantic. He reminded you of one of the knights of Burne-Jones though he\nwas on a larger scale and there was no suggestion that he suffered from\nthe chronic colitis that afflicted those unfortunate creatures. He was\nthe sort of man whom you expected to look wonderful in fancy dress till\nyou saw him in it and then you found that he looked absurd.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPresently I finished my dinner and went into the lounge. He was sitting\nin a large arm-chair and when he saw me he called a waiter. I sat down.\nThe waiter came up and he ordered coffee and liqueurs. He spoke Italian\nvery well. I was wondering by what means I could find out who he was\nwithout offending him. People are always a little disconcerted when you\ndo not recognise them, they are so important to themselves, it is a\nshock to discover of what small importance they are to others. The\nexcellence of his Italian recalled him to me. I remembered who he was\nand remembered at the same time that I did not like him. His name was\nHumphrey Carruthers. He was in the Foreign Office and he had a position\nof some importance. He was in charge of I know not what department. He\nhad been attached to various embassies and I supposed that a sojourn in\nRome accounted for his idiomatic Italian. It was stupid of me not to\nhave seen at once that he was connected with the diplomatic service. He\nhad all the marks of the profession. He had the supercilious courtesy\nthat is so well calculated to put up the backs of the general public and\nthe aloofness due to the consciousness the diplomat has that he is not\nas other men are, joined with the shyness occasioned by his uneasy\nfeeling that other men do not quite realise it. I had known Carruthers\nfor a good many years, but had met him infrequently, at luncheon-parties\nwhere I said no more than how do you do to him and at the opera where he\ngave me a cool nod. He was generally thought intelligent; he was\ncertainly cultured. He could talk of all the right things. It was\ninexcusable of me not to have remembered him, for he had lately acquired\na very considerable reputation as a writer of short stories. They had\nappeared first in one or other of those magazines that are founded now\nand then by well-disposed persons to give the intelligent reader\nsomething worthy of his attention and that die when their proprietors\nhave lost as much money as they want to; and in their discreet and\nhandsomely printed pages had excited as much attention as an exiguous\ncirculation permitted. Then they were published in book form. They\ncreated a sensation. I have seldom read such unanimous praise in the\nweekly papers. Most of them gave the book a column and the Literary\nSupplement of <i>The Times</i> reviewed it not among the common ruck of\nnovels but in a place by itself cheek by jowl with the memoirs of a\ndistinguished statesman. The critics welcomed Humphrey Carruthers as a\nnew star in the firmament. They praised his distinction, his subtlety,\nhis delicate irony and his insight. They praised his style, his sense of\nbeauty and his atmosphere. Here at last was a writer who had raised the\nshort story from the depths into which in English-speaking countries it\nhad fallen and here was work to which an Englishman could point with\npride; it bore comparison with the best compositions in this manner of\nFinland, Russia and Czecho-Slovakia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThree years later Humphrey Carruthers brought out his second book and\nthe critics commented on the interval with satisfaction. Here was no\nhack prostituting his talent for money! The praise it received was\nperhaps a little cooler than that which welcomed his first volume, the\ncritics had had time to collect themselves, but it was enthusiastic\nenough to have delighted any common writer who earns his living by his\npen and there was no doubt that his position in the world of letters was\nsecure and honourable. The story that attracted most commendation was\ncalled <i>The Shaving Mop</i> and all the best critics pointed out with what\nbeauty the author in three or four pages had laid bare the tragic soul\nof a barber's assistant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut his best known story, which was also his longest, was called <i>Week\nEnd</i>. It gave its title to his first book. It narrated the adventures of\na number of people who left Paddington Station on Saturday afternoon to\nstay with friends at Taplow and on Monday morning returned to London. It\nwas so delicate that it was a little difficult to know exactly what\nhappened. A young man, parliamentary secretary to a Cabinet Minister,\nvery nearly proposed to a baronet's daughter, but didn't. Two or three\nothers went on the river in a punt. They all talked a great deal in an\nallusive way, but none of them ever finished a sentence and what they\nmeant was very subtly indicated by dots and dashes. There were a good\nmany descriptions of flowers in the garden and a sensitive picture of\nthe Thames under the rain. It was all seen through the eyes of the\nGerman governess and everyone agreed that Carruthers had conveyed her\noutlook on the situation with quite delicious humour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI read both Humphrey Carruthers' books. I think it part of the writer's\nbusiness to make himself aware of what is being written by his\ncontemporaries. I am very willing to learn and I thought I might\ndiscover in them something that would be useful to me. I was\ndisappointed. I like a story to have a beginning, a middle, and an end.\nI have a weakness for a point. I think atmosphere is all very well, but\natmosphere without anything else is like a frame without a picture; it\nhas not much significance. But it may be that I could not see the merit\nof Humphrey Carruthers on account of defects in myself, and if I have\ndescribed his two most successful stories without enthusiasm the cause\nperhaps lies in my own wounded vanity. For I was perfectly conscious\nthat Humphrey Carruthers looked upon me as a writer of no account. I am\nconvinced that he had never read a word I had written. The popularity I\nenjoyed was sufficient to persuade him that there was no occasion for\nhim to give me any of his attention. For a moment, such was the stir he\ncreated, it looked as though he might himself be faced with that\nignominy, but it soon appeared that his exquisite work was above the\nheads of the public. One can never tell how large the intelligentsia is,\nbut one can tell fairly well how many of its members are prepared to pay\nmoney to patronise the arts they cherish. The plays that are of too fine\na quality to attract the patrons of the commercial theatre can count on\nan audience of ten thousand, and the books that demand from their\nreaders more comprehension than can be expected from the common herd\nsell twelve hundred copies. For the intelligentsia, notwithstanding\ntheir sensitiveness to beauty, prefer to go to the theatre on the nod\nand to get a book from the library.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI am sure this did not distress Carruthers. He was an artist. He was\nalso a clerk in the Foreign Office. His reputation as a writer was\ndistinguished; he was not interested in the vulgar, and to sell well\nwould possibly have damaged his career. I could not surmise what had\ninduced him to invite me to have coffee with him. It is true he was\nalone, but I should have supposed he found his thoughts excellent\ncompany, and I could not believe he imagined that I had anything to say\nthat would interest him. Nevertheless I could not but see that he was\ndoing his dreary best to be affable. He reminded me of where we had last\nmet and we talked for a moment of common friends in London. He asked me\nhow I came to be in Rome at this season and I told him. He volunteered\nthe information that he had arrived that morning from Brindisi. Our\nconversation did not go easily and I made up my mind that as soon as I\ncivilly could I would get up and leave him. But presently I had an odd\nsensation, I hardly know what caused it, that he was conscious of this\nand was desperately anxious not to give me the opportunity. I was\nsurprised. I gathered my wits about me. I noticed that whenever I paused\nhe broke in with a new topic. He was trying to find something to\ninterest me so that I should stay. He was straining every nerve to be\nagreeable. Surely he could not be lonely; with his diplomatic\nconnections he must know plenty of people with whom he could have spent\nthe evening. I wondered indeed that he was not dining at the Embassy;\neven though it was summer there must be someone there he knew. I noticed\nalso that he never smiled. He talked with a sort of harsh eagerness as\nthough he were afraid of a moment's silence and the sound of his voice\nshut out of his mind something that tortured him. It was very strange.\nThough I did not like him, though he meant nothing to me and to be with\nhim irked me somewhat, I was against my will a trifle interested. I gave\nhim a searching glance. I wondered if it was my fancy that I saw in\nthose pale eyes of his the cowed look of a hunted dog and\nnotwithstanding his neat features and his expression so civilly\ncontrolled, in his aspect something that suggested the grimace of a soul\nin pain. I could not understand. A dozen absurd notions flashed through\nmy mind. I was not particularly sympathetic: like an old war-horse\nscenting the fray I roused myself. I had been feeling very tired, but\nnow I grew alert. My sensibilities put out tentacles. I was suddenly\nalive to every expression of his face and every gesture. I put aside the\nthought that had come to me that he had written a play and wanted my\nadvice. These exquisite persons succumb strangely to the glamour of the\nfootlights and they are not averse from getting a few tips from the\ncraftsman whose competence they superciliously despise. No, it was not\nthat. A single man in Rome, of æsthetic leanings, is liable to get into\ntrouble, and I asked myself whether Carruthers had got into some\ndifficulty to extricate himself from which the Embassy was the last\nplace he could go to. The idealist, I have noticed, is apt at times to\nbe imprudent in the affairs of the flesh. He sometimes finds love in\nplaces which the police inconveniently visit. I tittered in my heart.\nEven the gods laugh when a prig is caught in an equivocal situation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSuddenly Carruthers said something that staggered me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm so desperately unhappy,\" he muttered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe said it without warning. He obviously meant it. There was in his tone\na sort of gasp. It might very well have been a sob. I cannot describe\nwhat a shock it was to me to hear him say those words. I felt as you do\nwhen you turn a corner of the street and on a sudden a great blast of\nwind meets you, takes your breath away, and nearly blows you off your\nfeet. It was so unexpected. After all I hardly knew the fellow. We were\nnot friends. I did not like him; he did not like me. I had never looked\non him as quite human. It was amazing that a man so self-controlled, so\nurbane, accustomed to the usages of polite society, should break in upon\na stranger with such a confession. I am naturally reticent. I should be\nashamed, whatever I was suffering, to disclose my pain to another. I\nshivered. His weakness outraged me. For a moment I was filled with a\npassion of anger. How dared he thrust the anguish of his soul on me? I\nvery nearly cried:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the hell do I care?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut I didn't. He was sitting huddled up in the big arm-chair. The solemn\nnobility of his features, which reminded one of the marble statue of a\nVictorian statesman, had strangely crumpled and his face sagged. He\nlooked almost as though he were going to cry. I hesitated. I faltered. I\nhad flushed when he spoke and now I felt my face go white. He was a\npitiable object.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm awfully sorry,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mind if I tell you about it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was not the moment for many words. I suppose Carruthers was in the\nearly forties. He was a well-made man, athletic in his way, and with a\nconfident bearing. Now he looked twenty years older and strangely\nshrivelled. He reminded me of the dead soldiers I had seen during the\nwar and how oddly small death had made them. I was embarrassed and\nlooked away, but I felt his eyes claiming mine and I looked back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you know Betty Welldon-Burns?\" he asked me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I used to meet her sometimes in London years ago. I've not seen her\nlately.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She lives in Rhodes now, you know. I've just come from there. I've been\nstaying with her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe hesitated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid you'll think it awfully strange of me to talk to you like\nthis. I'm at the end of my tether. If I don't talk to somebody I shall\ngo off my head.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had ordered double brandies with the coffee and now calling the\nwaiter he ordered himself another. We were alone in the lounge. There\nwas a little shaded lamp on the table between us. Because it was a\npublic room he spoke in a low voice. The place gave one oddly enough a\nsense of intimacy. I cannot repeat all that Carruthers said to me in the\nwords he said it; it would be impossible for me to remember them; it is\nmore convenient for me to put it in my own fashion. Sometimes he could\nnot bring himself to say a thing right out and I had to guess at what he\nmeant. Sometimes he had not understood, and it seemed to me that in\ncertain ways I saw the truth more clearly than he. Betty Welldon-Burns\nhad a very keen sense of humour and he had none. I perceived a good deal\nthat had escaped him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had met her a good many times, but I knew her chiefly from hearsay. In\nher day she had made a great stir in the little world of London and I\nhad heard of her often before I met her. This was at a dance in Portland\nPlace soon after the war. She was then already at the height of her\ncelebrity. You could not open an illustrated paper without seeing in it\na portrait of her, and her mad pranks were a staple of conversation. She\nwas twenty-four. Her mother was dead, her father, the Duke of St. Erth,\nold and none too rich, spent most of the year in his Cornish castle and\nshe lived in London with a widowed aunt. At the outbreak of the war she\nwent to France. She was just eighteen. She was a nurse in a hospital at\nthe Base and then drove a car. She acted in a theatrical tour designed\nto amuse the troops; she posed in tableaux at home for charitable\npurposes, held auctions for this object and that and sold flags in\nPiccadilly. Every one of her activities was widely advertised and in\nevery new rôle she was profusely photographed. I suppose that she\nmanaged to have a very good time. But now that the war was over she was\nhaving her fling with a vengeance. Just then everybody a little lost his\nhead. The young, relieved of the burden that for five years had\noppressed them, indulged in one wild escapade after another. Betty took\npart in them all. Sometimes, for one reason or another, an account of\nthem found its way into the newspapers and her name was always in the\nheadline. At that time night clubs were in the first flush of their\nsuccess and she was to be seen at them every night. She lived a life of\nhectic gaiety. It can only be described in a hackneyed phrase, because\nit was a hackneyed thing. The British public in its odd way took her to\nits heart and Lady Betty was a sufficient description of her throughout\nthe British islands. Women mobbed her when she went to a wedding and the\ngallery applauded her at first nights as though she were a popular\nactress. Girls copied the way she did her hair and manufacturers of soap\nand face cream paid her money to use her photograph to advertise their\nwares.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course dull, stodgy people, the people who remembered and regretted\nthe old order, disapproved of her. They sneered at her constant\nappearance in the limelight. They said she had an insane passion for\nself-advertisement. They said she was fast. They said she drank too\nmuch. They said she smoked too much. I will admit that nothing I had\nheard of her had predisposed me to think very well of her. I held cheap\nthe women who seemed to look upon the war as an occasion to enjoy\nthemselves and be talked about. I am bored by the papers in which you\nsee photographs of persons in society walking in Cannes or playing golf\nat St. Andrew's. I have always found the Bright Young People extremely\ntedious. The gay life seems dull and stupid to the onlooker, but the\nmoralist is unwise to judge it harshly. It is as absurd to be angry with\nthe young things who lead it as with a litter of puppies scampering\naimlessly around, rolling one another over and chasing their tails. It\nis well to bear it with fortitude if they cause havoc in the flower beds\nor break a piece of china. Some of them will be drowned because their\npoints are not up to the mark and the rest will grow up into\nwell-behaved dogs. Their unruliness is due only to the vitality of\nyouth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd it was vitality that was Betty's most shining characteristic. The\nurge of life flowed through her with a radiance that dazzled you. I do\nnot think I shall ever forget the impression she made on me at the party\nat which I first saw her. She was like a mænad. She danced with an\nabandon that made you laugh, so obvious was her intense enjoyment of the\nmusic and the movement of her young limbs. Her hair was brown, slightly\ndisordered by the vigour of her gestures, but her eyes were deep blue,\nand her skin was milk and roses. She was a great beauty, but she had\nnone of the coldness of great beauty. She laughed constantly and when\nshe was not laughing she smiled and her eyes danced with the joy of\nliving. She was like a milkmaid on the farmstead of the gods. She had\nthe strength and health of the people; and yet the independence of her\nbearing, a sort of noble frankness of carriage, suggested the great\nlady. I do not quite know how to put the feeling she gave me, that\nthough so simple and unaffected she was not unconscious of her station.\nI fancied that if occasion arose she could get on her dignity and be\nvery grand indeed. She was charming to everybody because, probably\nwithout being quite aware of it, in the depths of her heart she felt\nthat the rest of the world was perfectly insignificant. I understood why\nthe factory girls in the East End adored her and why half a million\npeople who had never seen her except in a photograph looked upon her\nwith the intimacy of personal friendship. I was introduced to her and\nshe spent a few minutes talking to me. It was extraordinarily flattering\nto see the interest she showed in you; you knew she could not really be\nso pleased to meet you as she seemed or so delighted with what you said,\nbut it was very attractive. She had the gift of being able to jump over\nthe first difficult phases of acquaintance and you had not known her for\nfive minutes before you felt you had known her all her life. She was\nsnatched away from me by someone who wanted to dance with her and she\nsurrendered herself to her partner's arms with just the same eager\nhappiness as she had shown when she sank into a chair by my side. I was\nsurprised when I met her at luncheon a fortnight later to find that she\nremembered exactly what we had talked about during those noisy ten\nminutes at the dance. A young woman with all the social graces.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI mentioned the incident to Carruthers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was no fool,\" he said. \"Very few people knew how intelligent she\nwas. She wrote some very good poetry. Because she was so gay, because\nshe was so reckless and never cared a damn for anybody, people thought\nshe was scatter-brained. Far from it. She was as clever as a monkey. You\nwould never have thought she'd had the time to read all the things she\nhad. I don't suppose anyone knew that side of her as well as I did. We\nused to take walks together, in the country at week-ends, and in London\nwe'd drive out to Richmond Park and walk there, and talk. She loved\nflowers and trees and grass. She was interested in everything. She had a\nlot of information and a lot of sense. There was nothing she couldn't\ntalk about. Sometimes when we'd been for a walk in the afternoon and we\nmet at a night club and she'd had a couple of glasses of champagne, that\nwas enough to make her completely buffy, you know, and she was the life\nand soul of the party, I couldn't help thinking how amazed the rest of\nthem would be if they knew how seriously we'd been talking only a few\nhours before. It was an extraordinary contrast. There seemed to be two\nentirely different women in her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCarruthers said all this without a smile. He spoke with the melancholy\nhe might have used if he had been speaking of some person snatched from\nthe pleasant company of the living by untimely death. He gave a deep\nsigh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was madly in love with her. I proposed to her half a dozen times. Of\ncourse I knew I hadn't a chance, I was only a very junior clerk at the\nP.O., but I couldn't help myself. She refused me, but she was always\nfrightfully nice about it. It never made any difference to our\nfriendship. You see, she really liked me. I gave her something that\nother people didn't. I always thought that she was really fonder of me\nthan of anybody. I was crazy about her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't suppose you were the only one,\" I said, having to say\nsomething.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Far from it. She used to get dozens of love-letters from men she'd\nnever seen or heard of, farmers in Africa, miners, and policemen in\nCanada. All sorts of people proposed to her. She could have married\nanyone she liked.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Even royalty, one heard.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, she said she couldn't stand the life. And then she married Jimmie\nWelldon-Burns.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"People were rather surprised, weren't they?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you ever know him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I don't think so. I may have met him, but he left no impression on\nme.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He wouldn't. He was the most insignificant fellow that ever breathed.\nHis father was a big manufacturer up in the North. He'd made a lot of\nmoney during the war and bought a baronetcy. I believe he hadn't an\naitch to his name. Jimmy was at Eton with me, they'd tried hard to make\na gentleman of him, and in London after the war he was about a good\ndeal. He was always willing to throw a party. No one ever paid any\nattention to him. He just paid the bill. He was the most crashing bore.\nYou know, rather prim, terribly polite; he made you rather uncomfortable\nbecause he was so anxious not to do the wrong thing. He always wore his\nclothes as though he'd just put them on for the first time and they were\na little too tight for him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Carruthers innocently opened his <i>Times</i> one morning and casting\nhis eyes down the fashionable intelligence of the day saw that a\nmarriage had been arranged between Elizabeth, only daughter of the Duke\nof St. Erth, and James, eldest son of Sir John Welldon-Burns, Bart., he\nwas dumbfounded. He rang Betty up and asked if it was true.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was so shocked that for the moment he found nothing to say. She went\non speaking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's bringing his family to luncheon to-day to meet father. I dare say\nit'll be a bit grim. You might stand me a cocktail at Claridge's to\nfortify me, will you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At what time?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right. I'll meet you there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was waiting for her when she came in. She walked with a sort of\nspring as though her eager feet itched to break into a dance. She was\nsmiling. Her eyes shone with the joy that suffused her because she was\nalive and the world was such a pleasant place to live in. People\nrecognising her whispered to one another as she came in. Carruthers\nreally felt that she brought sunshine and the scent of flowers into the\nsober but rather overwhelming splendour of Claridge's lounge. He did not\nwait to say how do you do to her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Betty, you can't do it,\" he said. \"It's simply out of the question.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's awful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think he is. I think he's rather nice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA waiter came up and took their order. Betty looked at Carruthers with\nthose beautiful blue eyes of hers that managed to be at the same time so\ngay and so tender.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's such a frightful bounder, Betty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, don't be so silly, Humphrey. He's just as good as anybody else. I\nthink you're rather a snob.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's so dull.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, he's rather quiet. I don't know that I want a husband who's too\nbrilliant. I think he'll make a very good background. He's quite\ngood-looking and he has nice manners.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My God, Betty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, don't be idiotic, Humphrey.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you going to pretend you're in love with him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think it would be tactful, don't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why are you going to marry him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him coolly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's got pots of money. I'm nearly twenty-six.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was nothing much more to be said. He drove her back to her aunt's\nhouse. She had a very grand marriage, with dense crowds lining the\napproach to St. Margaret's, Westminster, presents from practically all\nthe royal family, and the honeymoon was passed on the yacht her\nfather-in-law had lent them. Carruthers applied for a post abroad and\nwas sent to Rome (I was right in guessing that he had thus acquired his\nadmirable Italian) and later to Stockholm. Here he was counsellor and\nhere he wrote the first of his stories.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPerhaps Betty's marriage had disappointed the British public who\nexpected much greater things of her, perhaps only that as a young\nmarried woman she no longer appealed to the popular sense of romance;\nthe fact was plain that she soon lost her place in the public eye. You\nceased to hear very much about her. Not long after the marriage it was\nrumoured that she was going to have a baby and a little later that she\nhad had a miscarriage. She did not drop out of society, I suppose she\ncontinued to see her friends, but her activities were no longer\nspectacular. She was certainly but seldom seen any more in those raffish\nassemblies where the members of a tarnished aristocracy hob-nob with the\nhangers-on of the arts and flatter themselves that they are being at\nonce smart and cultured. People said she was settling down. They\nwondered how she was getting on with her husband and no sooner did they\ndo this than they concluded that she was not getting on very well.\nPresently gossip said that Jimmie was drinking too much and then, a year\nor two later, one heard that he had contracted tuberculosis. The\nWelldon-Burns' spent a couple of winters in Switzerland. Then the news\nspread that they had separated and Betty had gone to live in Rhodes. An\nodd place to choose.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must be deadly,\" her friends said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA few of them went to stay with her now and then and came back with\nreports of the beauty of the island and the leisurely charm of the life.\nBut of course it was very lonely. It seemed strange that Betty, with her\nbrilliance and her energy, should be content to settle there. She had\nbought a house. She knew no one but a few Italian officials, there was\nindeed no one to know; but she seemed perfectly happy. Her visitors\ncould not make it out. But the life of London is busy and memories are\nshort. People ceased to concern themselves with her. She was forgotten.\nThen, a few weeks before I met Humphrey Carruthers in Rome, <i>The Times</i>\nannounced the death of Sir James Welldon-Burns, second baronet. His\nyounger brother succeeded him in the title. Betty had never had a child.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCarruthers continued to see her after the marriage. Whenever he came to\nLondon they lunched together. She had the ability to take up a\nfriendship after a long separation as though no passage of time had\nintervened, so that there was never any strangeness in their meetings.\nSometimes she asked him when he was going to marry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're getting on, you know, Humphrey. If you don't marry soon you'll\nget rather old-maidish.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you recommend marriage?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was not a very kindly thing to say, because like everyone else he had\nheard that she was not getting on too well with her husband, but her\nremark piqued him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"On the whole. I think probably an unsatisfactory marriage is better\nthan no marriage at all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know quite well that nothing would induce me to marry and you know\nwhy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my dear, you're not going to pretend that you're still in love with\nme?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are a damned fool.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't care.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe smiled at him. Her eyes always had that look, partly bantering,\npartly tender, that gave him such a happy pain in his heart. Funny, he\ncould almost localise it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're rather sweet, Humphrey. You know I'm devoted to you, but I\nwouldn't marry you even if I were free.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen she left her husband and went to live in Rhodes Carruthers ceased\nto see her. She never came to England. They maintained an active\ncorrespondence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Her letters were wonderful,\" he said. \"You seemed to hear her talking.\nThey were just like her. Clever and witty, inconsequent and yet so\nshrewd.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe suggested coming to Rhodes for a few days, but she thought he had\nbetter not. He understood why. Everyone knew he had been madly in love\nwith her. Everyone knew he was still. He did not know in what\ncircumstances exactly the Welldon-Burns' had separated. It might be that\nthere had been a good deal of bad feeling. Betty might think that his\npresence on the island would compromise her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She wrote a charming letter to me when my first book came out. You know\nI dedicated it to her. She was surprised that I had done anything so\ngood. Everyone was very nice about it, and she was delighted with that.\nI think her pleasure was the chief thing that pleased me. After all I'm\nnot a professional writer, you know: I don't attach much importance to\nliterary success.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFool, I thought, and liar. Did he think I had not noticed the\nself-satisfaction that consumed him on account of the favourable\nreception of his books? I did not blame him for feeling that, nothing\ncould be more pardonable, but why be at such pains to deny it. But it\nwas doubtless true that it was mostly for Betty's sake that he relished\nthe notoriety they had brought him. He had a positive achievement to\noffer her. He could lay at her feet now not only his love, but a\ndistinguished reputation. Betty was not very young any more, she was\nthirty-six; her marriage, her sojourn abroad, had changed things; she\nwas no longer surrounded by suitors; she had lost the halo with which\nthe public admiration had surrounded her. The distance between them was\nno longer insuperable. He alone had remained faithful through the years.\nIt was absurd that she should continue to bury her beauty, her wit, her\nsocial grace in an island in a corner of the Mediterranean. He knew she\nwas fond of him. She could hardly fail to be touched by his long\ndevotion. And the life he had to offer her now was one that he knew\nwould appeal to her. He made up his mind to ask her once more to marry\nhim. He was able to get away towards the end of July. He wrote and said\nthat he was going to spend his leave in the Greek islands and if she\nwould be glad to see him he would stop off at Rhodes for a day or two,\nwhere he had heard the Italians had opened a very good hotel. He put his\nsuggestion in this casual way out of delicacy. His training at the\nForeign Office had taught him to eschew abruptness. He never willingly\nput himself in a position from which he could not if necessary withdraw\nwith tact. Betty sent him a telegram in reply. She said it was too\nmarvellous that he was coming to Rhodes and of course he must come and\nstay with her, for at least a fortnight, and he was to wire what boat he\nwas coming by.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was in a state of wild excitement when at last the ship he had taken\nat Brindisi steamed, soon after sunrise, into the neat and pretty\nharbour of Rhodes. He had hardly slept a wink all night and getting up\nearly had watched the island loom grandly out of the dawn and the sun\nrise over the summer sea. Boats came out as the ship dropped her anchor.\nThe gangway was lowered. Humphrey, leaning over the rail, watched the\ndoctor and the port officials and the hotel couriers swarm up it. He was\nthe only Englishman on board. His nationality was obvious. A man came on\ndeck and immediately walked up to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you Mr. Carruthers?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was about to smile and put out his hand, but he perceived in the\ntwinkling of an eye that the person who addressed him, an Englishman\nlike himself, was not a gentleman. Instinctively his manner, remaining\nexceedingly polite, became a trifle stiff. Of course Carruthers did not\ntell me this, but I see the scene so clearly that I have no hesitation\nin describing it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Her ladyship hopes you don't mind her not coming to meet you, but the\nboat got in so early and it's more than an hour's drive to where we\nlive.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, of course. Her ladyship well?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, thank you. Got your luggage ready?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you'll show me where it is I'll tell one of these fellows to put it\nin a boat. You won't have any difficulty at the Customs. I've fixed that\nup all right, and then we'll get off. Have you had breakfast?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, thank you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe man was not quite sure of his aitches. Carruthers wondered who he\nwas. You could not say he was uncivil, but he was certainly a little\noffhand. Carruthers knew that Betty had rather a large estate; perhaps\nhe was her agent. He seemed very competent. He gave the porters\ninstructions in fluent Greek and when they got in the boat and the\nboatmen asked for more money than he gave them, he said something that\nmade them laugh and they shrugged their shoulders satisfied. The luggage\nwas passed through the Customs without examination, Humphrey's guide\nshaking hands with the officials, and they went into a sunny place where\na large yellow car was standing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you going to drive me?\" asked Carruthers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm her ladyship's chauffeur.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I see. I didn't know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was not dressed like a chauffeur. He wore white duck trousers and\nespadrilles on his bare feet, a white tennis shirt, with no tie and open\nat the neck, and a straw hat. Carruthers frowned. Betty oughtn't to let\nher chauffeur drive the car like that. It was true that he had had to\nget up before daybreak and it looked like being a hot drive up to the\nvilla. Perhaps under ordinary conditions he wore uniform. Though not so\ntall as Carruthers, who was six feet one in his socks, he was not short;\nbut he was broad-shouldered and squarely built, so that he looked\nstocky. He was not fat, but plump rather; he looked as though he had a\nhearty appetite and ate well. Young still, thirty perhaps or thirty-one,\nhe had already a massive look and one day would be very beefy. Now he\nwas a hefty fellow. He had a broad face deeply sunburned, a short\nthickish nose and a somewhat sullen look. He wore a short fair\nmoustache. Oddly enough Carruthers had a vague feeling that he had seen\nhim before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you been with her ladyship long?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I have, in a manner of speaking.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCarruthers became a trifle stiffer. He did not quite like the manner in\nwhich the chauffeur spoke. He wondered why he did not say \"sir\" to him.\nHe was afraid Betty had let him get a little above himself. It was like\nher to be a bit careless about such things. But it was a mistake. He'd\ngive her a hint when he got a chance. Their eyes met for an instant and\nhe could have sworn that there was a twinkle of amusement in the\nchauffeur's. Carruthers could not imagine why. He was not aware that\nthere was anything amusing in him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That, I suppose, is the old city of the Knights,\" he said distantly,\npointing to the battlemented walls.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. Her ladyship'll take you over. We get a rare lot of tourists here\nin the season.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCarruthers wished to be affable. He thought it would be nicer of him to\noffer to sit by the chauffeur rather than behind by himself and was just\ngoing to suggest it when the matter was taken out of his hands. The\nchauffeur told the porters to put Carruthers' bags at the back, and\nsettling himself at the wheel said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now if you'll hop in we'll get along.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCarruthers sat down beside him and they set off along a white road that\nran by the sea. In a few minutes they were in the open country. They\ndrove in silence. Carruthers was a little on his dignity. He felt that\nthe chauffeur was inclined to be familiar and he did not wish to give\nhim occasion to be so. He flattered himself that he had a manner with\nhim that puts his inferiors in their place. He thought with sardonic\ngrimness that it would not be long before the chauffeur would be calling\nhim \"sir\". But the morning was lovely; the white road ran between olive\ngroves and the farm-houses they passed now and then, with their white\nwalls and flat roofs, had an Oriental look that took the fancy. And\nBetty was waiting for him. The love in his heart disposed him to\nkindliness towards all men and lighting himself a cigarette he thought\nit would be a generous act to offer the chauffeur one too. After all,\nRhodes was very far away from England and the age was democratic. The\nchauffeur accepted the gift and stopped the car to light up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you got the baccy?\" he asked suddenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have I got what?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe chauffeur's face fell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Her ladyship wired to you to bring two pounds of Player's Navy Cut.\nThat's why I fixed it up with the Customs people not to open your\nluggage.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never got the wire.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damn!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What on earth does her ladyship want with two pounds of Player's Navy\nCut?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe spoke with hauteur. He did not like the chauffeur's exclamation. The\nfellow gave him a sidelong glance in which Carruthers read a certain\ninsolence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We can't get it here,\" he said briefly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe threw away with what looked very like exasperation the Egyptian\ncigarette Carruthers had given him and started off again. He looked\nsulky. He said nothing more. Carruthers felt that his efforts at\nsociability had been a mistake. For the rest of the journey he ignored\nthe chauffeur. He adopted the frigid manner that he had used so\nsuccessfully as secretary at the Embassy when a member of the British\npublic came to him for assistance. For some time they had been running\nup hill and now they came to a long low wall and then to an open gate.\nThe chauffeur turned in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have we arrived?\" cried Carruthers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sixty-five kilometres in fifty-seven minutes,\" said the chauffeur, a\nsmile suddenly showing his fine white teeth. \"Not so bad considering the\nroad.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sounded his klaxon shrilly. Carruthers was breathless with\nexcitement. They drove up a narrow road through an olive grove, and came\nto a low, white, rambling house. Betty was standing at the door. He\njumped out of the car and kissed her on both cheeks. For a moment he\ncould not speak. But subconsciously he noticed that at the door stood an\nelderly butler in white ducks and a couple of footmen in the fustanellas\nof their country. They were smart and picturesque. Whatever Betty\npermitted her chauffeur it was evident that the house was run in the\ncivilised style suited to her station. She led him through the hall, a\nlarge apartment with whitewashed walls in which he was vaguely conscious\nof handsome furniture, into the drawing-room. This also was large and\nlow, with the same whitewashed walls, and he had immediately an\nimpression of comfort and luxury.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The first thing you must do is to come and look at my view,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The first thing I must do is to look at you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was dressed in white. Her arms, her face, her neck, were deeply\nburned by the sun; her eyes were bluer than he had ever seen them and\nthe whiteness of her teeth was startling. She looked extremely well. She\nwas very trim and neat. Her hair was waved, her nails were manicured; he\nhad had a moment's anxiety that in the easy life she led on this\nromantic isle she had let herself go.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Upon my word you look eighteen, Betty. How do you manage it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Happiness,\" she smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt gave him a momentary pang to hear her say this. He did not want her\nto be too happy. He wanted to give her happiness. But now she insisted\non taking him out on the terrace. The drawing-room had five long windows\nthat led out to it and from the terrace the olive-clad hill tumbled\nsteeply to the sea. There was a tiny bay below in which a white boat,\nmirrored on the calm water, lay at anchor. On a further hill, round the\ncorner, you saw the white houses of a Greek village and beyond it a huge\ngrey crag surmounted by the battlements of a medieval castle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was one of the strongholds of the Knights,\" she said. \"I'll take you\nup there this evening.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe scene was quite lovely. It took your breath away. It was peaceful\nand yet it had a strange air of life. It moved you not to contemplation,\nbut stirred you to activity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got the tobacco all right, I suppose.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe started.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I haven't. I never got your wire.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I wired to the Embassy and I wired to the Excelsior.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I stayed at the Plaza.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a bore! Albert'll be furious.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is Albert?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He drove you out. Player's is the only tobacco he likes and he can't\nget it here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, the chauffeur.\" He pointed to the boat that lay gleaming beneath\nthem. \"Is that the yacht I've heard about?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a large caïque that Betty had bought, fitted with a motor\nauxiliary and smartened up. In it she wandered about the Greek islands.\nShe had been as far north as Athens and as far south as Alexandria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'll take you for a trip if you can spare the time,\" she said. \"You\nought to see Cos while you're here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who runs it for you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I have a crew, but Albert chiefly. He's very clever with\nmotors and all that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not know why it gave him a vague discomfort to hear her speak of\nthe chauffeur again. Carruthers wondered if she did not leave too much\nin his hands. It was a mistake to give a servant too much leeway.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, I couldn't help thinking I'd seen Albert before somewhere.\nBut I can't place him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe smiled brightly, her eyes shining, with that sudden gaiety of hers\nthat gave her face its delightful frankness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You ought to remember him. He was the second footman at Aunt Louise's.\nHe must have opened the door to you hundreds of times.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAunt Louise was the aunt with whom Betty had lived before her marriage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, is that who he is? I suppose I must have seen him there without\nnoticing him. How does he happen to be here?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He comes from our place at home. When I married he wanted to come with\nme, so I took him. He was Jimmie's valet for some time and then I sent\nhim to some motor works, he was mad about cars, and eventually I took\nhim on as my chauffeur. I don't know what I should do without him now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you think it's rather a mistake to get too dependent on a\nservant?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. It never occurred to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBetty showed him the rooms that had been got ready for him, and when he\nhad changed they strolled down to the beach. A dinghy was waiting for\nthem and they rowed out to the caïque and bathed from there. The water\nwas warm and they sunned themselves on the deck. The caïque was roomy,\ncomfortable and luxurious. Betty showed him over and they came upon\nAlbert tinkering with the engines. He was in filthy overalls, his hands\nwere black and his face was smeared with grease.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's the matter, Albert?\" said Betty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe raised himself and faced her respectfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing, m'lady. I was just 'aving a look round.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There are only two things Albert loves in the world. One is the car and\nthe other's the yacht. Isn't that true, Albert?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a gay smile and Albert's rather stolid face lit up. He\nshowed his beautiful white teeth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's true, m'lady.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He sleeps on board, you know. We rigged up a very nice cabin for him\naft.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCarruthers fell into the life very easily. Betty had bought the estate\nfrom a Turkish pasha exiled to Rhodes by Abdul Hamid and she had added a\nwing to the picturesque house. She had made a wild garden of the olive\ngrove that surrounded it. It was planted with rosemary and lavender and\nasphodel, broom that she had had sent from England and the roses for\nwhich the island was famous. In the spring, she told him, the ground was\ncarpeted with anemones. But when she showed him her property, telling\nhim her plans and what alterations she had in mind, Carruthers could not\nhelp feeling a little uneasy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You talk as though you were going to live here all your life,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps I am,\" she smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What nonsense! At your age.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm getting on for forty, old boy,\" she answered lightly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe discovered with satisfaction that Betty had an excellent cook and it\ngratified his sense of propriety to dine with her in the splendid\ndining-room, with its Italian furniture, and be waited on by the\ndignified Greek butler and the two handsome footmen in their flamboyant\nuniforms. The house was furnished with taste; the rooms contained\nnothing that was not essential, but every piece was good. Betty lived in\nconsiderable state. When, the day after his arrival, the Governor with\nseveral members of his staff came over to dinner she displayed all the\nresources of the household. The Governor entering the house passed\nbetween a double row of flunkeys magnificent in their starched\npetticoats, embroidered jackets and velvet caps. It was almost a\nbodyguard. Carruthers liked the grand style. The dinner-party was very\ngay. Betty's Italian was fluent and Carruthers spoke it perfectly. The\nyoung officers in the Governor's suite were uncommonly smart in their\nuniforms. They were very attentive to Betty and she treated them with\neasy cordiality. She chaffed them. After dinner the gramophone was\nturned on and they danced with her one after the other.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen they were gone Carruthers asked her:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Aren't they all madly in love with you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know about that. They hint occasionally at alliances permanent\nor otherwise, but they take it very good-naturedly when I decline with\nthanks.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were not serious. The young ones were callow and the not so young\nwere fat and bald. Whatever they might feel about her Carruthers could\nnot for a moment believe that Betty would make a fool of herself with a\nmiddle-class Italian. But a day or two later a curious thing happened.\nHe was in his rooms dressing for dinner; he heard a man's voice outside\nin the passage, he could not hear what was said or what language was\nspoken, and then ringing out suddenly Betty's laughter. It was a\ncharming laugh, rippling and gay, like a young girl's, and it had a\njoyous abandon that was infectious. But whom could she be laughing with?\nIt was not the way you would laugh with a servant. It had a curious\nintimacy. It may seem strange that Carruthers read all this into a peal\nof laughter, but it must be remembered that Carruthers was very subtle.\nHis stories were remarkable for such touches.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen they met presently on the terrace and he was shaking a cocktail he\nsought to gratify his curiosity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What were you laughing your head off over just now? Has anyone been\nhere?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him with genuine surprise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought one of your Italian officers had come to pass the time of\nday.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course the passage of years had had its effect on Betty. She was\nbeautiful, but her beauty was mature. She had always had assurance, but\nnow she had repose; her serenity was a feature, like her blue eyes and\nher candid brow, that was part of her beauty. She seemed to be at peace\nwith all the world; it rested you to be with her as it rested you to lie\namong the olives within sight of the wine-coloured sea. Though she was\nas gay and witty as ever, the seriousness which once he had been alone\nto know was now patent. No one could accuse her any longer of being\nscatter-brained; it was impossible not to perceive the fineness of her\ncharacter. It had even nobility. That was not a trait it was usual to\nfind in the modern woman and Carruthers said to himself that she was a\nthrow-back; she reminded him of the great ladies of the eighteenth\ncentury. She had always had a feeling for literature, the poems she\nwrote as a girl were graceful and melodious, and he was more interested\nthan surprised when she told him that she had undertaken a solid\nhistorical work. She was getting materials together for an account of\nthe Knights of St. John in Rhodes. It was a story of romantic incidents.\nShe took Carruthers to the city and showed him the noble battlements and\ntogether they wandered through austere and stately buildings. They\nstrolled up the silent Street of the Knights with the lovely stone\nfaçades and the great coats of arms that recalled a dead chivalry. She\nhad a surprise for him here. She had bought one of the old houses and\nwith affectionate care had restored it to its old state. When you\nentered the little courtyard, with its carved stone stairway, you were\ntaken back into the middle ages. It had a tiny walled garden in which a\nfig-tree grew and roses. It was small and secret and silent. The old\nknights had been in contact with the East long enough to have acquired\nOriental ideas of privacy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When I'm tired of the villa I come here for two or three days and\npicnic. It's a relief sometimes not to be surrounded by people.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But you're not alone here?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Practically.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a little parlour austerely furnished.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is this?\" said Carruthers pointing with a smile to a copy of <i>The\nSporting Times</i> that lay on a table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, that's Albert's. I suppose he left it here when he came to meet\nyou. He has <i>The Sporting Times</i> and the <i>News of the World</i> sent him\nevery week. That is how he keeps abreast of the great world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe smiled tolerantly. Next to the parlour was a bedroom with nothing\nmuch in it but a large bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The house belonged to an Englishman. That's partly why I bought it. He\nwas a Sir Giles Quern, and one of my ancestors married a Mary Quern who\nwas a cousin of his. They were Cornish people.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFinding that she could not get on with her history without such a\nknowledge of Latin as would enable her to read the medieval documents\nwith ease, Betty had set about learning the classical language. She\ntroubled to acquire only the elements of grammar and then started, with\na translation by her side, to read the authors that interested her. It\nis a very good method of learning a language and I have often wondered\nthat it is not used in schools. It saves all the endless turning over of\ndictionaries and the fumbling search for meaning. After nine months\nBetty could read Latin as fluently as most of us can read French. It\nseemed a trifle ridiculous to Carruthers that this lovely, brilliant\ncreature should take her work so seriously and yet he was moved; he\nwould have liked to snatch her in his arms and kiss her, not at that\nmoment as a woman, but as a precocious child whose cleverness suddenly\nenchants you. But later he reflected upon what she had told him. He was\nof course a very clever man, otherwise he could not have attained the\nposition he held in the Foreign Office, and it would be silly to claim\nthat those two books of his could have made so much stir without some\nmerit; if I have made him look a bit of a fool it is only because I did\nnot happen to like him, and if I have derided his stories it is merely\nbecause stories of that sort seem to me rather silly. He had tact and\ninsight. He had a conviction that there was but one way to win her. She\nwas in a groove and happy in it, her plans were definite; but her life\nat Rhodes was so well-ordered, so complete and satisfying, that for that\nvery reason its hold over her could be combated. His chance was to\narouse in her the restlessness that lies deep in the heart of the\nEnglish. So he talked to Betty of England and London, their common\nfriends and the painters, writers and musicians with whom his literary\nsuccess had brought him acquaintance. He talked of the Bohemian parties\nin Chelsea, and of the opera, of trips to Paris <i>en bande</i> for a\nfancy-dress ball or to Berlin to see the new plays. He recalled to her\nimagination a life rich and easy, varied, cultured, intelligent and\nhighly civilised. He tried to make her feel that she was stagnating in a\nbackwater. The world was hurrying on, from one new and interesting phase\nto another, and she was standing still. They were living in a thrilling\nage and she was missing it. Of course he did not tell her this; he left\nher to infer it. He was amusing and spirited, he had an excellent memory\nfor a good story, he was whimsical and gay. I know I have not made\nHumphrey Carruthers witty any more than I have shown Lady Betty\nbrilliant. The reader must take my word for it that they were.\nCarruthers was generally reckoned an entertaining companion, and that is\nhalf the battle; people were willing to find him amusing and they vowed\nthe things he said were marvellous. Of course his wit was social. It\nneeded a particular company, who understood his allusions and shared his\nexclusive sense of humour. There are a score of journalists in Fleet\nStreet who could knock spots off the most famous of the society wits; it\nis their business to be witty and brilliance is in their day's work.\nThere are few of the society beauties whose photographs appear in the\npapers who could get a job at three pounds a week in the chorus of a\nsong-and-dance show. Amateurs must be judged with tolerance. Carruthers\nknew that Betty enjoyed his society. They laughed a great deal together.\nThe days passed in a flash.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall miss you terribly when you go,\" she said in her frank way.\n\"It's been a treat having you here. You are a sweet, Humphrey.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you only just discovered it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe patted himself on the back. His tactics had been right. It was\ninteresting to see how well his simple plan had worked. Like a charm.\nThe vulgar might laugh at the Foreign Office, but there was no doubt it\ntaught you how to deal with difficult people. Now he had but to choose\nhis opportunity. He felt that Betty had never been more attached to him.\nHe would wait till the end of his visit. Betty was emotional. She would\nbe sorry that he was going. Rhodes would seem very dull without him.\nWhom would she have to talk to when he was gone? After dinner they\nusually sat on the terrace looking at the starry sea; the air was warm\nand balmy and vaguely scented: it was then he would ask her to marry\nhim, on the eve of his departure. He felt it in his bones that she would\naccept him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne morning when he had been in Rhodes a little over a week, he happened\nto be coming upstairs as Betty was walking along the passage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've never shown me your room, Betty,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Haven't I? Come in and have a look now. It's rather nice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe turned back and he followed her in. It was over the drawing-room and\nnearly as large. It was furnished in the Italian style, and as is the\npresent way more like a sitting-room than a bedroom. There were fine\nPaninis on the walls and one or two handsome cabinets. The bed was\nVenetian and beautifully painted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's a couch of rather imposing dimensions for a widow lady,\" he said\nfacetiously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is enormous, isn't it? But it was so lovely, I had to buy it. It\ncost a fortune.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis eye took in the bed-table by the side. There were two or three books\non it, a box of cigarettes, and on an ash-tray a briar pipe. Funny! What\non earth had Betty got a pipe by her bed for?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do look at this <i>cassone</i>. Isn't the painting marvellous? I almost\ncried when I found it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose that cost a fortune too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I daren't tell you what I paid.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen they were leaving the room he cast another glance at the bed-table.\nThe pipe had vanished.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was odd that Betty should have a pipe in her bedroom, she certainly\ndidn't smoke one herself, and if she had would have made no secret of\nit, but of course there were a dozen reasonable explanations. It might\nbe a present she was making to somebody, one of the Italians or even\nAlbert, he had not been able to see if it was new or old, or it might be\na pattern that she was going to ask him to take home to have others of\nthe same sort sent out to her. After the moment's perplexity, not\naltogether unmingled with amusement, he put the matter out of his mind.\nThey were going for a picnic that day, taking their luncheon with them,\nand Betty was driving him herself. They had arranged to go for a cruise\nof a couple of days before he left so that he should see Patmos and Cos,\nand Albert was busy with the engines of the caïque. They had a wonderful\nday. They visited a ruined castle and climbed a mountain on which grew\nasphodel, hyacinth and narcissus, and returned dead beat. They separated\nnot long after dinner and Carruthers went to bed. He read for a little\nand then turned out his light. But he could not sleep. It was hot under\nhis mosquito-net. He turned and tossed. Presently he thought he would go\ndown to the little beach at the foot of the hill and bathe. It was not\nmore than three minutes' walk. He put on his espadrilles and took a\ntowel. The moon was full and he saw it shining on the sea through the\nolive-trees. But he was not alone to have thought that this radiant\nnight would be lovely to bathe in, for just before he came out on to the\nbeach sounds reached his ears. He muttered a little damn of vexation,\nsome of Betty's servants were bathing, and he could not very well\ndisturb them. The olive-trees came almost to the water's edge and\nundecided he stood in their shelter. He heard a voice that gave him a\nsudden start.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where's my towel?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEnglish. A woman waded out of the water and stood for a moment at its\nedge. From the darkness a man came forward with nothing but a towel\nround his loins. The woman was Betty. She was stark naked. The man\nwrapped a bath-robe round her and began drying her vigorously. She\nleaned on him while she put on first one shoe and then the other and to\nsupport her he placed his arm round her shoulders. The man was Albert.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCarruthers turned and fled up the hill. He stumbled blindly. Once he\nnearly fell. He was gasping like a wounded beast. When he got into his\nroom he flung himself on the bed and clenched his fists and the dry,\npainful sobs that tore his chest broke into tears. He evidently had a\nviolent attack of hysterics. It was all clear to him, clear with the\nghastly vividness with which on a stormy night a flash of lightning can\ndisclose a ravaged landscape, clear, horribly clear. The way the man had\ndried her and the way she leaned against him pointed not to passion, but\nto a long-continued intimacy, and the pipe by the bedside, the pipe had\na hideously conjugal air. It suggested the pipe a man might smoke while\nhe was reading in bed before going to sleep. <i>The Sporting Times!</i> That\nwas why she had that little house in the Street of the Knights, so that\nthey could spend two or three days together in domestic familiarity.\nThey were like an old married couple. Humphrey asked himself how long\nthe hateful thing had lasted and suddenly he knew the answer; for years.\nTen, twelve, fourteen; it had started when the young footman first came\nto London, he was a boy then and it was obvious enough that it was not\nhe who had made the advances; all through those years when she was the\nidol of the British public, when everyone adored her and she could have\nmarried anyone she liked, she was living with the second footman at her\naunt's house. She took him with her when she married. Why had she made\nthat surprising marriage? And the still-born child that came before its\ntime. Of course that was why she had married Jimmie Welldon-Burns,\nbecause she was going to have a child by Albert. Oh, shameless,\nshameless! And then, when Jimmie's health broke down she had made him\ntake Albert as his valet. And what had Jimmie known and what had he\nsuspected? He drank, that was what had started his tuberculosis; but why\nhad he started drinking? Perhaps it was to still a suspicion that was so\nugly that he could not face it. And it was to live with Albert that she\nhad left Jimmie and it was to live with Albert that she had settled in\nRhodes. Albert, his hands with their broken nails stained by his work on\nthe motors, coarse of aspect and stocky, rather like a butcher with his\nhigh colour and clumsy strength, Albert not even very young any more and\nrunning to fat, uneducated and vulgar, with his common way of speaking.\nAlbert, Albert, how could she?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCarruthers got up and drank some water. He threw himself into a chair.\nHe could not bear his bed. He smoked cigarette after cigarette. He was a\nwreck in the morning. He had not slept at all. They brought him in his\nbreakfast; he drank the coffee but could eat nothing. Presently there\nwas a brisk knock on his door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Coming down to bathe, Humphrey?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat cheerful voice sent the blood singing through his head. He braced\nhimself and opened the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think I will to-day. I don't feel very well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my dear, you look all in. What's the matter with you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. I think I must have got a touch of the sun.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis voice was dead and his eyes were tragic. She looked at him more\nclosely. She did not say anything for a moment. He thought she went\npale. He knew. Then a faintly mocking smile crossed her eyes; she\nthought the situation comic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor old boy, go and lie down, I'll send you in some aspirin. Perhaps\nyou'll feel better at luncheon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe lay in his darkened room. He would have given anything to get away\nthen so that he need not set eyes on her again, but there was no means\nof that, the ship that was to take him back to Brindisi did not touch at\nRhodes till the end of the week. He was a prisoner. And the next day\nthey were to go to the islands. There was no escape from her there; in\nthe caïque they would be in one another's pockets all day long. He\ncouldn't face that. He was so ashamed. But she wasn't ashamed. At that\nmoment when it had been plain to her that nothing was hidden from him\nany longer she had smiled. She was capable of telling him all about it.\nHe could not bear that. That was too much. After all she couldn't be\ncertain that he knew, at best she could only suspect; if he behaved as\nif nothing had happened, if at luncheon and during the days that\nremained he was as gay and jolly as usual she would think she had been\nmistaken. It was enough to know what he knew, he would not suffer the\ncrowning humiliation of hearing from her own lips the disgraceful story.\nBut at luncheon the first thing she said was:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Isn't it a bore. Albert says something's gone wrong with the motor, we\nshan't be able to go on our trip after all. I daren't trust to sail at\nthis time of the year. We might be becalmed for a week.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe spoke lightly and he answered in the same casual fashion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, but still I don't really care. It's so lovely here, I\nreally didn't much want to go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe told her that the aspirin had done him good and he felt much better;\nto the Greek butler and the two footmen in fustanellas it must have\nseemed that they talked as vivaciously as usual. That night the British\nconsul came to dinner and the night after some Italian officers.\nCarruthers counted the days, he counted the hours. Oh, if the moment\nwould only come when he could step on the ship and be free from the\nhorror that every moment of the day obsessed him! He was growing so\ntired. But Betty's manner was so self-possessed that sometimes he asked\nhimself if she really knew that he was aware of her secret. Was it the\ntruth that she had told about the caïque and not, as had at once struck\nhim, an excuse; and was it an accident that a succession of visitors\nprevented them from ever being alone together? The worst of having so\nmuch tact was that you never quite knew whether other people were acting\nnaturally or being tactful too. When he looked at her, so easy and calm,\nso obviously happy, he could not believe the odious truth. And yet he\nhad seen with his own eyes. And the future. What would her future be? It\nwas horrible to think of. Sooner or later the truth must become\nnotorious. And to think of Betty a mock and an outcast, in the power of\na coarse and common man, growing older, losing her beauty; and the man\nwas five years younger than she. One day he would take a mistress, one\nof her own maids, perhaps, with whom he would feel at home as he had\nnever felt with the great lady, and what could she do then? What\nhumiliation then must she be prepared to put up with! He might be cruel\nto her. He might beat her. Betty. Betty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCarruthers wrung his hands. And on a sudden an idea came to him that\nfilled him with a painful exaltation; he put it away from him, but it\nreturned; it would not let him be. He must save her, he had loved her\ntoo much and too long to let her sink, sink as she was sinking; a\npassion of self-sacrifice welled up in him. Notwithstanding everything,\nthough his love now was dead and he felt for her an almost physical\nrepulsion, he would marry her. He laughed mirthlessly. What would his\nlife be? He couldn't help that. He didn't matter. It was the only thing\nto do. He felt wonderfully uplifted, and yet very humble, for he was\nawed at the thought of the heights which the divine spirit of man could\nreach.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis ship was to sail on Saturday and on Thursday when the guests who had\nbeen dining left them, he said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope we're going to be alone to-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As a matter of fact I've asked some Egyptians who spend the summer\nhere. She's a sister of the ex-Khedive and very intelligent. I'm sure\nyou'll like her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it's my last evening. Couldn't we spend it alone?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a glance. There was a faint amusement in her eyes, but his\nwere grave.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you like. I can put them off.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was to start early in the morning and his luggage was packed. Betty\nhad told him not to dress, but he had answered that he preferred to. For\nthe last time they sat down to dinner facing one another. The\ndining-room, with its shaded lights, was bare and formal, but the summer\nnight flooding in through the great open windows gave it a sober\nrichness. It had the effect of the private refectory in a convent to\nwhich a royal lady had retired in order to devote the remainder of her\nlife to a piety not too austere. They had their coffee on the terrace.\nCarruthers drank a couple of liqueurs. He was feeling very nervous.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Betty, my dear, I've got something I want to say to you,\" he began.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you? I wouldn't say it if I were you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe answered gently. She remained perfectly calm, watching him shrewdly,\nbut with the glimmer of a smile in her blue eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shrugged her shoulders and was silent. He was conscious that his\nvoice trembled a little and he was angry with himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know I've been madly in love with you for many years. I don't know\nhow many times I've asked you to marry me. But, after all, things change\nand people change too, don't they? We're neither of us so young as we\nwere. Won't you marry me now, Betty?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him the smile that had always been such an attractive thing in\nher; it was so kindly, so frank, and still, still so wonderfully\ninnocent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're very sweet, Humphrey. It's awfully nice of you to ask me again.\nI can't tell you how touched I am. But you know, I'm a creature of\nhabit, I've got in the habit of saying no to you now, and I can't change\nit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why not?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was something aggressive in his tone, something almost ominous,\nthat made her give him a quick look. Her face blanched with sudden\nanger, but she immediately controlled herself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Because I don't want to,\" she smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you going to marry anyone else?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I? No. Of course not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a moment she seemed to draw herself up as though a wave of ancestral\npride swept through her and then she began to laugh. But whether she\nlaughed at the thought that had passed through her mind or because\nsomething in Humphrey's proposal had amused her none but she could have\ntold.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Betty. I implore you to marry me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't go on living this life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put into his voice all the anguish of his heart and his face was\ndrawn and tortured. She smiled affectionately.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why not? Don't be such a donkey. You know I adore you, Humphrey, but\nyou are rather an old woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Betty. Betty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDid she not see that it was for her sake that he wanted it? It was not\nlove that made him speak, but human pity and shame. She got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be tiresome, Humphrey. You'd better go to bed, you know you have\nto be up with the lark. I shan't see you in the morning. Good-bye and\nGod bless you. It's been wonderful having you here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe kissed him on both cheeks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext morning, early, for he had to be on board at eight, when Carruthers\nstepped out of the front door he found Albert waiting for him in the\ncar. He wore a singlet, duck trousers and a beret basque. Carruthers'\nluggage was in the back. He turned to the butler.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Put my bags beside the chauffeur,\" he said. \"I'll sit behind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlbert made no remark. Carruthers got in and they drove off. When they\narrived at the harbour, porters ran up. Albert got out of the car.\nCarruthers looked down at him from his greater height.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You need not see me on board. I can manage perfectly well by myself.\nHere's a tip for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave him a five-pound note. Albert flushed. He was taken aback, he\nwould have liked to refuse it, but did not know how to, and the\nservility of years asserted itself. Perhaps he did not know what he\nsaid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCarruthers gave him a curt nod and walked away. He had forced Betty's\nlover to call him \"sir\". It was as though he had struck her a blow\nacross that smiling mouth of hers and flung in her face an opprobrious\nword. It filled him with a bitter satisfaction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe shrugged his shoulders and I could see that even this small triumph\nnow seemed vain. For a little while we were silent. There was nothing\nfor me to say. Then he began again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say you think it's very strange that I should tell you all this.\nI don't care. You know, I feel as if nothing mattered any more. I feel\nas if decency no longer existed in the world. Heaven knows, I'm not\njealous. You can't be jealous unless you love and my love is dead. It\nwas killed in a flash. After all those years. I can't think of her now\nwithout horror. What destroys me, what makes me so frightfully unhappy\nis to think of her unspeakable degradation.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo it has been said that it was not jealousy that caused Othello to kill\nDesdemona, but an agony that the creature that he believed angelic\nshould be proved impure and worthless. What broke his noble heart was\nthat virtue should so fall.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought there was no one like her. I admired her so much. I admired\nher courage and her frankness, her intelligence and her love of beauty.\nShe's just a sham and she's never been anything else.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder if that's true. Do you think any of us are all of a piece? Do\nyou know what strikes me? I should have said that Albert was only the\ninstrument, her toll to the solid earth, so to speak, that left her soul\nat liberty to range the empyrean. Perhaps the mere fact that he was so\nfar below her gave her a sense of freedom in her relations with him that\nshe would have lacked with a man of her own class. The spirit is very\nstrange, it never soars so high as when the body has wallowed for a\nperiod in the gutter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, don't talk such rot,\" he answered angrily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think it is rot. I don't put it very well, but the idea's\nsound.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Much good it does me. I'm broken and done for. I'm finished.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, nonsense. Why don't you write a story about it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, that's the great pull a writer has over other people. When\nsomething has made him terribly unhappy, and he's tortured and\nmiserable, he can put it all into a story and it's astonishing what a\ncomfort and relief it is.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be monstrous. Betty was everything in the world to me. I\ncouldn't do anything so caddish.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe paused for a little and I saw him reflect. I saw that notwithstanding\nthe horror that my suggestion caused him he did for one minute look at\nthe situation from the standpoint of the writer. He shook his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not for her sake, for mine. After all I have some self-respect.\nBesides, there's no story there.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI remember very well the occasion on which I first saw Jane Fowler. It\nis indeed only because the details of the glimpse I had of her then are\nso clear that I trust my recollection at all, for, looking back, I must\nconfess that I find it hard to believe that it has not played me a\nfantastic trick. I had lately returned to London from China and was\ndrinking a dish of tea with Mrs. Tower. Mrs. Tower had been seized with\nthe prevailing passion for decoration; and with the ruthlessness of her\nsex had sacrificed chairs in which she had comfortably sat for years,\ntables, cabinets, ornaments on which her eyes had dwelt in peace since\nshe was married, pictures that had been familiar to her for a\ngeneration; and delivered herself into the hands of an expert. Nothing\nremained in her drawing-room with which she had any association, or to\nwhich any sentiment was attached; and she had invited me that day to see\nthe fashionable glory in which she now lived. Everything that could be\npickled was pickled and what couldn't be pickled was painted. Nothing\nmatched, but everything harmonised.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you remember that ridiculous drawing-room suite that I used to\nhave?\" asked Mrs. Tower.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe curtains were sumptuous yet severe; the sofa was covered with\nItalian brocade; the chair on which I sat was in petit point. The room\nwas beautiful, opulent without garishness and original without\naffectation; yet to me it lacked something; and while I praised with my\nlips I asked myself why I so much preferred the rather shabby chintz of\nthe despised suite, the Victorian water-colours that I had known so\nlong, and the ridiculous Dresden china that had adorned the\nchimney-piece. I wondered what it was that I missed in all these rooms\nthat the decorators were turning out with a profitable industry. Was it\nheart? But Mrs. Tower looked about her happily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you like my alabaster lamps?\" she said. \"They give such a soft\nlight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Personally I have a weakness for a light that you can see by,\" I\nsmiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's so difficult to combine that with a light that you can't be too\nmuch seen by,\" laughed Mrs. Tower.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had no notion what her age was. When I was quite a young man she was a\nmarried woman a good deal older than I, but now she treated me as her\ncontemporary. She constantly said that she made no secret of her age,\nwhich was forty, and then added with a smile that all women took five\nyears off. She never sought to conceal the fact that she dyed her hair\n(it was a very pretty brown with reddish tints), and she said she did\nthis because hair was hideous while it was going grey; as soon as hers\nwas white she would cease to dye it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then they'll say what a young face I have.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMeanwhile it was painted, though with discretion, and her eyes owed not\na little of their vivacity to art. She was a handsome woman, exquisitely\ngowned, and in the sombre glow of the alabaster lamps did not look a day\nmore than the forty she gave herself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is only at my dressing-table that I can suffer the naked brightness\nof a thirty-two-candle electric bulb,\" she added with smiling cynicism.\n\"There I need it to tell me first the hideous truth and then to enable\nme to take the necessary steps to correct it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe gossiped pleasantly about our common friends and Mrs. Tower brought\nme up to date in the scandal of the day. After roughing it here and\nthere it was very agreeable to sit in a comfortable chair, the fire\nburning brightly on the hearth, charming tea-things set out on a\ncharming table, and talk with this amusing, attractive woman. She\ntreated me as a prodigal returned from his husks and was disposed to\nmake much of me. She prided herself on her dinner-parties; she took no\nless trouble to have her guests suitably assorted than to give them\nexcellent food; and there were few persons who did not look upon it as a\ntreat to be bidden to one of them. Now she fixed a date and asked me\nwhom I would like to meet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's only one thing I must tell you. If Jane Fowler is still here I\nshall have to put it off.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is Jane Fowler?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower gave a rueful smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Jane Fowler is my cross.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you remember a photograph that I used to have on the piano before I\nhad my room done, of a woman in a tight dress with tight sleeves and a\ngold locket, with her hair drawn back from a broad forehead and her ears\nshowing and spectacles on a rather blunt nose? Well, that was Jane\nFowler.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You had so many photographs about the room in your unregenerate days,\"\nI said, vaguely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It makes me shudder to think of them. I've made them into a huge\nbrown-paper parcel and hidden them in an attic.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, who is Jane Fowler?\" I asked again, smiling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's my sister-in-law. She was my husband's sister and she married a\nmanufacturer in the North. She's been a widow for many years, and she's\nvery well-to-do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And why is she your cross?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's worthy, she's dowdy, she's provincial. She looks twenty years\nolder than I do and she's quite capable of telling anyone she meets that\nwe were at school together. She has an overwhelming sense of family\naffection and because I am her only living connection she's devoted to\nme. When she comes to London it never occurs to her that she should stay\nanywhere but here--she thinks it would hurt my feelings--and she'll pay\nme visits of three or four weeks. We sit here and she knits and reads.\nAnd sometimes she insists on taking me to dine at Claridge's and she\nlooks like a funny old charwoman and everyone I particularly don't want\nto be seen by is sitting at the next table. When we are driving home she\nsays she loves giving me a little treat. With her own hands she makes me\ntea-cosies that I am forced to use when she is here and doilies and\ncentrepieces for the dining-room table.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower paused to take breath.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have thought a woman of your tact would find a way to deal\nwith a situation like that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, but don't you see, I haven't a chance. She's so immeasurably kind.\nShe has a heart of gold. She bores me to death, but I wouldn't for\nanything let her suspect it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And when does she arrive?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the answer was hardly out of Mrs. Tower's mouth when the bell rang.\nThere were sounds in the hall of a slight commotion and in a minute or\ntwo the butler ushered in an elderly lady.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Fowler,\" he announced.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Jane,\" cried Mrs. Tower, springing to her feet. \"I wasn't expecting you\nto-day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So your butler has just told me. I certainly said to-day in my letter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower recovered her wits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it doesn't matter. I'm very glad to see you whenever you come.\nFortunately I'm doing nothing this evening.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You mustn't let me give you any trouble. If I can have a boiled egg for\nmy dinner that's all I shall want.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA faint grimace for a moment distorted Mrs. Tower's handsome features. A\nboiled egg!\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I think we can do a little better than that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI chuckled inwardly when I recollected that the two ladies were\ncontemporaries. Mrs. Fowler looked a good fifty-five. She was a rather\nbig woman; she wore a black straw hat with a wide brim and from it a\nblack lace veil hung over her shoulders, a cloak that oddly combined\nseverity with fussiness, a long black dress, voluminous as though she\nwore several petticoats under it, and stout boots. She was evidently\nshort-sighted, for she looked at you through large gold-rimmed\nspectacles.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Won't you have a cup of tea?\" asked Mrs. Tower.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If it wouldn't be too much trouble. I'll take off my mantle.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe began by stripping her hands of the black gloves she wore, and then\ntook off her cloak. Round her neck was a solid gold chain from which\nhung a large gold locket in which I felt certain was a photograph of her\ndeceased husband. Then she took off her hat and placed it neatly with\nher gloves and cloak on the sofa corner. Mrs. Tower pursed her lips.\nCertainly those garments did not go very well with the austere but\nsumptuous beauty of Mrs. Tower's redecorated drawing-room. I wondered\nwhere on earth Mrs. Fowler had found the extraordinary clothes she wore.\nThey were not old and the materials were expensive. It was astounding to\nthink that dressmakers still made things that had not been worn for a\nquarter of a century. Mrs. Fowler's grey hair was very plainly done,\nshowing all her forehead and her ears, with a parting in the middle. It\nhad evidently never known the tongs of Monsieur Marcel. Now her eyes\nfell on the tea-table with its teapot of Georgian silver and its cups in\nold Worcester.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What have you done with the tea-cosy I gave you last time I came up,\nMarion?\" she asked. \"Don't you use it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I used it every day, Jane,\" answered Mrs. Tower glibly.\n\"Unfortunately we had an accident with it a little while ago. It got\nburnt.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But the last one I gave you got burnt.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid you'll think us very careless.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It doesn't really matter,\" smiled Mrs. Fowler. \"I shall enjoy making\nyou another. I'll go to Liberty's to-morrow and buy some silks.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower kept her face bravely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't deserve it, you know. Doesn't your vicar's wife need one?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I've just made her one,\" said Mrs. Fowler brightly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI noticed that when she smiled she showed white, small and regular\nteeth. They were a real beauty. Her smile was certainly very sweet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut I felt it high time for me to leave the two ladies to themselves, so\nI took my leave.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEarly next morning Mrs. Tower rang me up and I heard at once from her\nvoice that she was in high spirits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got the most wonderful news for you,\" she said. \"Jane is going to\nbe married.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nonsense.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Her fiancé is coming to dine here to-night to be introduced to me and I\nwant you to come too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, but I shall be in the way.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, you won't. Jane suggested herself that I should ask you. Do come.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was bubbling over with laughter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. She tells me he's an architect. Can you imagine the sort\nof man Jane would marry?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had nothing to do and I could trust Mrs. Tower to give me a good\ndinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen I arrived Mrs. Tower, very splendid in a tea-gown a little too\nyoung for her, was alone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Jane is putting the finishing touches to her appearance. I'm longing\nfor you to see her. She's all in a flutter. She says he adores her. His\nname is Gilbert and when she speaks of him her voice gets all funny and\ntremulous. It makes me want to laugh.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder what he's like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I'm sure I know. Very big and massive, with a bald head and an\nimmense gold chain across an immense tummy. A large, fat, clean-shaven,\nred face and a booming voice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Fowler came in. She wore a very stiff black silk dress with a wide\nskirt and a train. At the neck it was cut into a timid V and the sleeves\ncame down to the elbows. She wore a necklace of diamonds set in silver.\nShe carried in her hands a long pair of black gloves and a fan of black\nostrich feathers. She managed (as so few people do) to look exactly what\nshe was. You could never have thought her anything in the world but the\nrespectable relict of a North-country manufacturer of ample means.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've really got quite a pretty neck, Jane,\" said Mrs. Tower with a\nkindly smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was indeed astonishingly young when you compared it with her\nweather-beaten face. It was smooth and unlined and the skin was white.\nAnd I noticed then that her head was very well placed on her shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Has Marion told you my news?\" she said, turning to me with that really\ncharming smile of hers as if we were already old friends.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must congratulate you,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wait to do that till you've seen my young man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think it's too sweet to hear you talk of your young man,\" smiled Mrs.\nTower.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Fowler's eyes certainly twinkled behind her preposterous\nspectacles.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't expect anyone too old. You wouldn't like me to marry a decrepit\nold gentleman with one foot in the grave, would you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis was the only warning she gave us. Indeed there was no time for any\nfurther discussion, for the butler flung open the door and in a loud\nvoice announced:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Gilbert Napier.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere entered a youth in a very well-cut dinner jacket. He was slight,\nnot very tall, with fair hair in which there was a hint of a natural\nwave, clean-shaven and blue-eyed. He was not particularly good-looking,\nbut he had a pleasant, amiable face. In ten years he would probably be\nwizened and sallow; but now, in extreme youth, he was fresh and clean\nand blooming. For he was certainly not more than twenty-four. My first\nthought was that this was the son of Jane Fowler's fiancé (I had not\nknown he was a widower) come to say that his father was prevented from\ndining by a sudden attack of gout. But his eyes fell immediately on Mrs.\nFowler, his face lit up, and he went towards her with both, hands\noutstretched. Mrs. Fowler gave him hers, a demure smile on her lips, and\nturned to her sister-in-law.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is my young man, Marion,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe held out his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope you'll like me, Mrs. Tower,\" he said. \"Jane tells me you're the\nonly relation she has in the world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower's face was wonderful to behold. I saw then to admiration how\nbravely good breeding and social usage could combat the instincts of the\nnatural woman. For the astonishment and then the dismay that for an\ninstant she could not conceal were quickly driven away, and her face\nassumed an expression of affable welcome. But she was evidently at a\nloss for words. It was not unnatural if Gilbert felt a certain\nembarrassment and I was too busy preventing myself from laughing to\nthink of anything to say. Mrs. Fowler alone kept perfectly calm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know you'll like him, Marion. There's no one enjoys good food more\nthan he does.\" She turned to the young man. \"Marion's dinners are\nfamous.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know,\" he beamed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower made some quick rejoinder and we went downstairs. I shall not\nsoon forget the exquisite comedy of that meal. Mrs. Tower could not make\nup her mind whether the pair of them were playing a practical joke on\nher or whether Jane by wilfully concealing her fiancé's age had hoped to\nmake her look foolish. But then Jane never jested and she was incapable\nof doing a malicious thing. Mrs. Tower was amazed, exasperated and\nperplexed. But she had recovered her self-control, and for nothing would\nshe have forgotten that she was a perfect hostess whose duty it was to\nmake her party go. She talked vivaciously; but I wondered if Gilbert\nNapier saw how hard and vindictive was the expression of her eyes behind\nthe mask of friendliness that she turned to him. She was measuring him.\nShe was seeking to delve into the secret of his soul. I could see that\nshe was in a passion, for under her rouge her cheeks glowed with an\nangry red.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got a very high colour, Marion,\" said Jane, looking at her\namiably through her great round spectacles.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dressed in a hurry. I dare say I put on too much rouge.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, is it rouge? I thought it was natural. Otherwise I shouldn't have\nmentioned it.\" She gave Gilbert a shy little smile. \"You know, Marion\nand I were at school together. You would never think it to look at us\nnow, would you? But of course I've lived a very quiet life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI do not know what she meant by these remarks; it was almost incredible\nthat she made them in complete simplicity; but anyhow they goaded Mrs.\nTower to such a fury that she flung her own vanity to the winds. She\nsmiled brightly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We shall neither of us see fifty again, Jane,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIf the observation was meant to discomfit the widow it failed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gilbert says I mustn't acknowledge to more than forty-nine for his\nsake,\" she answered blandly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower's hands trembled slightly, but she found a retort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There is of course a certain disparity of age between you,\" she smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Twenty-seven years,\" said Jane. \"Do you think it's too much? Gilbert\nsays I'm very young for my age. I told you I shouldn't like to marry a\nman with one foot in the grave.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was really obliged to laugh and Gilbert laughed too. His laughter was\nfrank and boyish. It looked as though he were amused at everything Jane\nsaid. But Mrs. Tower was almost at the end of her tether and I was\nafraid that unless relief came she would for once forget that she was a\nwoman of the world. I came to the rescue as best I could.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you're very busy buying your trousseau,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. I wanted to get my things from the dressmaker in Liverpool I've\nbeen to ever since I was first married. But Gilbert won't let me. He's\nvery masterful, and of course he has wonderful taste.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him with a little affectionate smile, demurely, as though\nshe were a girl of seventeen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower went quite pale under her make-up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We're going to Italy for our honeymoon. Gilbert has never had a chance\nof studying Renaissance architecture and of course it's important for an\narchitect to see things for himself. And we shall stop in Paris on the\nway and get my clothes there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you expect to be away long?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gilbert has arranged with his office to stay away for six months. It\nwill be such a treat for him, won't it? You see, he's never had more\nthan a fortnight's holiday before.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why not?\" asked Mrs. Tower in a tone that no effort of will could\nprevent from being icy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's never been able to afford it, poor dear.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Tower, and into the exclamation put volumes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCoffee was served and the ladies went upstairs. Gilbert and I began to\ntalk in the desultory way in which men talk who have nothing whatever to\nsay to one another; but in two minutes a note was brought in to me by\nthe butler. It was from Mrs. Tower and ran as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <i>\"Come upstairs quickly and then go as soon as you can. Take him\n    with you. Unless I have it out with Jane at once I shall have a\n    fit.\"</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nI told a facile lie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Tower has a headache and wants to go to bed. I think if you don't\nmind we'd better clear out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Certainly,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe went upstairs and five minutes later were on the doorstep. I called a\ntaxi and offered the young man a lift.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, thanks,\" he answered. \"I'll just walk to the corner and jump on a\nbus.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower sprang to the fray as soon as she heard the front door close\nbehind us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you crazy, Jane?\" she cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not more than most people who don't habitually live in a lunatic\nasylum, I trust,\" Jane answered blandly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"May I ask why you're going to marry this young man?\" asked Mrs. Tower\nwith formidable politeness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Partly because he won't take no for an answer. He's asked me five\ntimes. I grew positively tired of refusing him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And why do you think he's so anxious to marry you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I amuse him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower gave an exclamation of annoyance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's an unscrupulous rascal. I very nearly told him so to his face.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You would have been wrong, and it wouldn't have been very polite.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's penniless and you're rich. You can't be such a besotted fool as\nnot to see that he's marrying you for your money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJane remained perfectly composed. She observed her sister-in-law's\nagitation with detachment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think he is, you know,\" she replied. \"I think he's very fond of\nme.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're an old woman, Jane.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm the same age as you are, Marion,\" she smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've never let myself go. I'm very young for my age. No one would think\nI was more than forty. But even I wouldn't dream of marrying a boy\ntwenty years younger than myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Twenty-seven,\" corrected Jane.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean to tell me that you can bring yourself to believe that it's\npossible for a young man to care for a woman old enough to be his\nmother?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've lived very much in the country for many years. I dare say there's\na great deal about human nature that I don't know. They tell me there's\na man called Freud, an Austrian, I believe...\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Mrs. Tower interrupted her without any politeness at all.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be ridiculous, Jane. It's so undignified. It's so ungraceful. I\nalways thought you were a sensible woman. Really you're the last person\nI should ever have thought likely to fall in love with a boy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I'm not in love with him. I've told him that. Of course I like him\nvery much or I wouldn't think of marrying him. I thought it only fair to\ntell him quite plainly what my feelings were towards him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower gasped. The blood rushed to her head and her breathing\noppressed her. She had no fan, but she seized the evening paper and\nvigorously fanned herself with it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you're not in love with him why do you want to marry him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've been a widow a very long time and I've led a very quiet life. I\nthought I'd like a change.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you want to marry just to be married why don't you marry a man of\nyour own age?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No man of my own age has asked me five times. In fact no man of my own\nage has asked me at all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJane chuckled as she answered. It drove Mrs. Tower to the final pitch of\nfrenzy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't laugh, Jane. I won't have it. I don't think you can be right in\nyour mind. It's dreadful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was altogether too much for her and she burst into tears. She knew\nthat at her age it was fatal to cry, her eyes would be swollen for\ntwenty-four hours and she would look a sight. But there was no help for\nit. She wept. Jane remained perfectly calm. She looked at Marion through\nher large spectacles and reflectively smoothed the lap of her black silk\ndress.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're going to be so dreadfully unhappy,\" Mrs. Tower sobbed, dabbing\nher eyes cautiously in the hope that the black on her lashes would not\nsmudge.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think so, you know,\" Jane answered in those equable, mild tones\nof hers, as if there were a little smile behind the words. \"We've talked\nit over very thoroughly. I always think I'm a very easy person to live\nwith. I think I shall make Gilbert very happy and comfortable. He's\nnever had anyone to look after him properly. We're only marrying after\nmature consideration. And we've decided that if either of us wants his\nliberty the other will place no obstacles in the way of his getting it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower had by now recovered herself sufficiently to make a cutting\nremark.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How much has he persuaded you to settle on him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wanted to settle a thousand a year on him, but he wouldn't hear of\nit. He was quite upset when I made the suggestion. He says he can earn\nquite enough for his own needs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's more cunning than I thought,\" said Mrs. Tower acidly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJane paused a little and looked at her sister-in-law with kindly but\nresolute eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see, my dear, it's different for you,\" she said. \"You've never been\nso very much a widow, have you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower looked at her. She blushed a little. She even felt slightly\nuncomfortable. But of course Jane was much too simple to intend an\ninnuendo. Mrs. Tower gathered herself together with dignity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm so upset that I really must go to bed,\" she said. \"We'll resume the\nconversation to-morrow morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid that won't be very convenient, dear. Gilbert and I are going\nto get the licence to-morrow morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower threw up her hands in a gesture of dismay, but she found\nnothing more to say.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe marriage took place at a registrar's office. Mrs. Tower and I were\nthe witnesses. Gilbert in a smart blue suit looked absurdly young and he\nwas obviously nervous. It is a trying moment for any man. But Jane kept\nher admirable composure. She might have been in the habit of marrying as\nfrequently as a woman of fashion. Only a slight colour on her cheeks\nsuggested that beneath her calm was some faint excitement. It is a\nthrilling moment for any woman. She wore a very full dress of silvery\ngrey velvet in the cut of which I recognised the hand of the dressmaker\nin Liverpool (evidently a widow of unimpeachable character) who had made\nher gowns for so many years; but she had so far succumbed to the\nfrivolity of the occasion as to wear a large picture hat covered with\nblue ostrich feathers. Her gold-rimmed spectacles made it\nextraordinarily grotesque. When the ceremony was over the registrar\n(somewhat taken aback, I thought, by the difference of age between the\npair he was marrying) shook hands with her, tendering his strictly\nofficial congratulations; and the bridegroom, blushing slightly, kissed\nher. Mrs. Tower, resigned but implacable, kissed her; and then the bride\nlooked at me expectantly. It was evidently fitting that I should kiss\nher too. I did. I confess that I felt a little shy as we walked out of\nthe registrar's office past loungers who waited cynically to see the\nbridal pairs, and it was with relief that I stepped into Mrs. Tower's\ncar. We drove to Victoria Station, for the happy couple were to go over\nto Paris by the two o'clock train, and Jane had insisted that the\nwedding-breakfast should be eaten at the station restaurant. She said it\nalways made her nervous not to be on the platform in good time. Mrs.\nTower, present only from a strong sense of family duty, was able to do\nlittle to make the party go off well; she ate nothing (for which I could\nnot blame her, since the food was execrable, and anyway I hate champagne\nat luncheon) and talked in a strained voice. But Jane went through the\nmenu conscientiously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I always think one should make a hearty meal before starting out on a\njourney,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe saw them off, and I drove Mrs. Tower back to her house.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How long do you give it?\" she said. \"Six months?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let's hope for the best,\" I smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be so absurd. There can be no 'best'. You don't think he's\nmarrying her for anything but her money, do you? Of course it can't\nlast. My only hope is that she won't have to go through as much\nsuffering as she deserves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI laughed. The charitable words were spoken in such a tone as to leave\nme in small doubt of Mrs. Tower's meaning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if it doesn't last you'll have the consolation of saying: 'I told\nyou so',\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I promise you I'll never do that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then you'll have the satisfaction of congratulating yourself on your\nself-control in not saying: 'I told you so'.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's old and dowdy and dull.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you sure she's dull?\" I said. \"It's true she doesn't say very much,\nbut when she says anything it's very much to the point.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've never heard her make a joke in my life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was once more in the Far East when Gilbert and Jane returned from\ntheir honeymoon and this time I remained away for nearly two years. Mrs.\nTower was a bad correspondent and though I sent her an occasional\npicture-postcard I received no news from her. But I met her within a\nweek of my return to London; I was dining out and found that I was\nseated next to her. It was an immense party, I think we were\nfour-and-twenty, like the blackbirds in the pie, and, arriving somewhat\nlate, I was too confused by the crowd in which I found myself to notice\nwho was there. But when we sat down, looking round the long table I saw\nthat a good many of my fellow-guests were well known to the public from\ntheir photographs in the illustrated papers. Our hostess had a weakness\nfor the persons technically known as celebrities and this was an\nunusually brilliant gathering. When Mrs. Tower and I had exchanged the\nconventional remarks that two people make when they have not seen one\nanother for a couple of years I asked about Jane.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's very well,\" said Mrs. Tower with a certain dryness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How has the marriage turned out?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower paused a little and took a salted almond from the dish in\nfront of her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It appears to be quite a success.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You were wrong then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I said it wouldn't last and I still say it won't last. It's contrary to\nhuman nature.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is she happy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're both happy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you don't see very much of them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At first I saw quite a lot of them. But now...\" Mrs. Tower pursed\nher lips a little. \"Jane is becoming very grand.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What <i>do</i> you mean?\" I laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I should tell you that she's here to-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Here?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was startled. I looked round the table again. Our hostess was a\ndelightful and an entertaining woman, but I could not imagine that she\nwould be likely to invite to a dinner such as this the elderly and dowdy\nwife of an obscure architect. Mrs. Tower saw my perplexity and was\nshrewd enough to see what was in my mind. She smiled thinly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look on the left of our host.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI looked. Oddly enough the woman who sat there had by her fantastic\nappearance attracted my attention the moment I was ushered into the\ncrowded drawing-room. I thought I noticed a gleam of recognition in her\neye, but to the best of my belief I had never seen her before. She was\nnot a young woman, for her hair was iron-grey; it was cut very short and\nclustered thickly round her well-shaped head in tight curls. She made no\nattempt at youth, for she was conspicuous in that gathering by using\nneither lipstick, rouge nor powder. Her face, not a particularly\nhandsome one, was red and weather-beaten; but because it owed nothing to\nartifice had a naturalness that was very pleasing. It contrasted oddly\nwith the whiteness of her shoulders. They were really magnificent. A\nwoman of thirty might have been proud of them. But her dress was\nextraordinary. I had not often seen anything more audacious. It was cut\nvery low, with short skirts, which were then the fashion, in black and\nyellow; it had almost the effect of fancy-dress and yet so became her\nthat though on anyone else it would have been outrageous, on her it had\nthe inevitable simplicity of nature. And to complete the impression of\nan eccentricity in which there was no pose and of an extravagance in\nwhich there was no ostentation she wore, attached by a broad black\nribbon, a single eyeglass.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not going to tell me <i>that</i> is your sister-in-law,\" I gasped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is Jane Napier,\" said Mrs. Tower icily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment she was speaking. Her host was turned towards her with an\nanticipatory smile. A baldish white-haired man, with a sharp,\nintelligent face, who sat on her left, was leaning forward eagerly, and\nthe couple who sat opposite, ceasing to talk with one another, listened\nintently. She said her say and they all, with a sudden movement, threw\nthemselves back in their chairs and burst into vociferous laughter. From\nthe other side of the table a man addressed Mrs. Tower: I recognised a\nfamous statesman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your sister-in-law has made another joke, Mrs. Tower,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's priceless, isn't she?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me have a long drink of champagne and then for heaven's sake tell\nme all about it,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWell, this is how I gathered it had all happened. At the beginning of\ntheir honeymoon Gilbert took Jane to various dressmakers in Paris and he\nmade no objection to her choosing a number of \"gowns\" after her own\nheart; but he persuaded her to have a \"frock\" or two made according to\nhis own design. It appeared that he had a knack for that kind of work.\nHe engaged a smart French maid. Jane had never had such a thing before.\nShe did her own mending and when she wanted \"doing up\" was in the habit\nof ringing for the housemaid. The dresses Gilbert had devised were very\ndifferent from anything she had worn before; but he had been careful not\nto go too far too quickly, and because it pleased him she persuaded\nherself, though not without misgivings, to wear them in preference to\nthose she had chosen herself. Of course she could not wear them with the\nvoluminous petticoats she had been in the habit of using, and these,\nthough it cost her an anxious moment, she discarded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now if you please,\" said Mrs. Tower, with something very like a sniff\nof disapproval, \"she wears nothing but thin silk tights. It's a wonder\nto me she doesn't catch her death of cold at her age.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGilbert and the French maid taught her how to wear her clothes, and,\nunexpectedly enough, she was very quick at learning. The French maid was\nin raptures over Madame's arms and shoulders. It was a scandal not to\nshow anything so fine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wait a little, Alphonsine,\" said Gilbert. \"The next lot of clothes I\ndesign for Madame we'll make the most of her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe spectacles of course were dreadful. No one could look really well in\ngold-rimmed spectacles. Gilbert tried some with tortoise-shell rims. He\nshook his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They'd look all right on a girl,\" he said. \"You're too old to wear\nspectacles, Jane.\" Suddenly he had an inspiration. \"By George, I've got\nit. You must wear an eyeglass.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Gilbert, I couldn't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him and his excitement, the excitement of the artist, made\nher smile. He was so sweet to her she wanted to do what she could to\nplease him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll try,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen they went to an optician and, suited with the right size, she\nplaced an eyeglass jauntily in her eye Gilbert clapped his hands. There\nand then, before the astonished shopman, he kissed her on both cheeks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You look wonderful,\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo they went down to Italy and spent happy months studying Renaissance\nand Baroque architecture. Jane not only grew accustomed to her changed\nappearance, but found she liked it. At first she was a little shy when\nshe went into the dining-room of an hotel and people turned round to\nstare at her, no one had ever raised an eyelid to look at her before,\nbut presently she found that the sensation was not disagreeable. Ladies\ncame up to her and asked her where she got her dress.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you like it?\" she answered demurely. \"My husband designed it for\nme.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should like to copy it if you don't mind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJane had certainly for many years lived a very quiet life, but she was\nby no means lacking in the normal instincts of her sex. She had her\nanswer ready.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm so sorry, but my husband's very particular and he won't hear of\nanyone copying my frocks. He wants me to be unique.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe had an idea that people would laugh when she said this, but they\ndidn't; they merely answered:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, of course I quite understand. You <i>are</i> unique.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut she saw them making mental notes of what she wore, and for some\nreason this quite \"put her about\". For once in her life that she wasn't\nwearing what everybody else did, she reflected, she didn't see why\neverybody else should want to wear what she did.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gilbert,\" she said, quite sharply for her, \"next time you're designing\ndresses for me I wish you'd design things that people <i>can't</i> copy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The only way to do that is to design things that only you can wear.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can't you do that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, if you'll do something for me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Cut off your hair.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI think this was the first time that Jane jibbed. Her hair was long and\nthick and as a girl she had been quite vain of it; to cut it off was a\nvery drastic proceeding. This really was burning her boats behind her.\nIn her case it was not the first step that cost so much, it was the\nlast; but she took it (\"I know Marion will think me a perfect fool, and\nI shall <i>never</i> be able to go to Liverpool again,\" she said), and when\nthey passed through Paris on their way home Gilbert led her (she felt\nquite sick, her heart was beating so fast) to the best hairdresser in\nthe world. She came out of his shop with a jaunty, saucy, impudent head\nof crisp grey curls. Pygmalion had finished his fantastic masterpiece:\nGalatea was come to life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"but that isn't enough to explain why Jane is here\nto-night amid this crowd of duchesses, Cabinet Ministers and such-like;\nnor why she is sitting on one side of her host with an Admiral of the\nFleet on the other.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Jane is a humorist,\" said Mrs. Tower. \"Didn't you see them all laughing\nat what she said?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was no doubt now of the bitterness in Mrs. Tower's heart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When Jane wrote and told me they were back from their honeymoon I\nthought I must ask them both to dinner. I didn't much like the idea, but\nI felt it had to be done. I knew the party would be deadly and I wasn't\ngoing to sacrifice any of the people who really mattered. On the other\nhand I didn't want Jane to think I hadn't any nice friends. You know I\nnever have more than eight, but on this occasion I thought it would make\nthings go better if I had twelve. I'd been too busy to see Jane until\nthe evening of the party. She kept us all waiting a little--that was\nGilbert's cleverness--and at last she sailed in. You could have knocked\nme down with a feather. She made the rest of the women look dowdy and\nprovincial. She made me feel like a painted old trollop.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower drank a little champagne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish I could describe the frock to you. It would have been quite\nimpossible on anyone else; on her it was perfect. And the eyeglass! I'd\nknown her for thirty-five years and I'd never seen her without\nspectacles.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But you knew she had a good figure.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How should I? I'd never seen her except in the clothes you first saw\nher in. Did <i>you</i> think she had a good figure? She seemed not to be\nunconscious of the sensation she made but to take it as a matter of\ncourse. I thought of my dinner and I heaved a sigh of relief. Even if\nshe was a little heavy in hand, with that appearance it didn't so very\nmuch matter. She was sitting at the other end of the table and I heard a\ngood deal of laughter, I was glad to think that the other people were\nplaying up well; but after dinner I was a good deal taken aback when no\nless than three men came up to me and told me that my sister-in-law was\npriceless, and did I think she would allow them to call on her? I didn't\nquite know whether I was standing on my head or my heels. Twenty-four\nhours later our hostess of to-night rang me up and said she had heard my\nsister-in-law was in London and she was priceless and would I ask her to\nluncheon to meet her? She has an infallible instinct, that woman: in a\nmonth everyone was talking about Jane. I am here to-night, not because\nI've known our hostess for twenty years and have asked her to dinner a\nhundred times, but because I'm Jane's sister-in-law.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPoor Mrs. Tower. The position was galling, and though I could not help\nbeing amused, for the tables were turned on her with a vengeance, I felt\nthat she deserved my sympathy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"People never can resist those who make them laugh,\" I said, trying to\nconsole her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She never makes <i>me</i> laugh.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOnce more from the top of the table I heard a guffaw and guessed that\nJane had said another amusing thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean to say that you are the only person who doesn't think her\nfunny?\" I asked, smiling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Had it struck <i>you</i> that she was a humorist?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm bound to say it hadn't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She says just the same things as she's said for the last thirty-five\nyears. I laugh when I see everyone else does because I don't want to\nseem a perfect fool, but I am not amused.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Like Queen Victoria,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a foolish jest and Mrs. Tower was quite right sharply to tell me\nso. I tried another tack.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is Gilbert here?\" I asked, looking down the table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gilbert was asked because she won't go out without him, but to-night\nhe's at a dinner of the Architects' Institute or whatever it's called.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm dying to renew my acquaintance with her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go and talk to her after dinner. She'll ask you to her Tuesdays.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Her Tuesdays?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's at home every Tuesday evening. You'll meet there everyone you\never heard of. They're the best parties in London. She's done in one\nyear what I've failed to do in twenty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what you tell me is really miraculous. How has it been done?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower shrugged her handsome but adipose shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall be glad if you'll tell me,\" she replied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter dinner I tried to make my way to the sofa on which Jane was\nsitting, but I was intercepted and it was not till a little later that\nmy hostess came up to me and said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must introduce you to the star of my party. Do you know Jane Napier?\nShe's priceless. She's much more amusing than your comedies.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was taken up to the sofa. The admiral who had been sitting beside her\nat dinner was with her still. He showed no sign of moving and Jane,\nshaking hands with me, introduced me to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you know Sir Reginald Frobisher?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe began to chat. It was the same Jane as I had known before, perfectly\nsimple, homely and unaffected, but her fantastic appearance certainly\ngave a peculiar savour to what she said. Suddenly I found myself shaking\nwith laughter. She had made a remark, sensible and to the point, but not\nin the least witty, which her manner of saying and the bland look she\ngave me through her eyeglass made perfectly irresistible. I felt\nlight-hearted and buoyant. When I left her she said to me:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you've got nothing better to do, come and see us on Tuesday evening.\nGilbert will be so glad to see you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When he's been a month in London he'll know that he can have nothing\nbetter to do,\" said the admiral.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo, on Tuesday but rather late, I went to Jane's. I confess I was a\nlittle surprised at the company. It was quite a remarkable collection of\nwriters, painters and politicians, actors, great ladies and great\nbeauties: Mrs. Tower was right, it was a grand party; I had seen nothing\nlike it in London since Stafford House was sold. No particular\nentertainment was provided. The refreshments were adequate without being\nluxurious. Jane in her quiet way seemed to be enjoying herself; I could\nnot see that she took a great deal of trouble with her guests, but they\nseemed to like being there and the gay, pleasant party did not break up\ntill two in the morning. After that I saw much of her. I not only went\noften to her house, but seldom went out to luncheon or to dinner without\nmeeting her. I am an amateur of humour and I sought to discover in what\nlay her peculiar gift. It was impossible to repeat anything she said,\nfor the fun, like certain wines, would not travel. She had no gift for\nepigram. She never made a brilliant repartee. There was no malice in her\nremarks nor sting in her rejoinders. There are those who think that\nimpropriety, rather than brevity, is the soul of wit; but she never said\na thing that could have brought a blush to a Victorian cheek. I think\nher humour was unconscious and I am sure it was unpremeditated. It flew\nlike a butterfly from flower to flower, obedient only to its own caprice\nand pursuivant of neither method nor intention. It depended on the way\nshe spoke and on the way she looked. Its subtlety gained by the\nflaunting and extravagant appearance that Gilbert had achieved for her;\nbut her appearance was only an element in it. Now of course she was the\nfashion and people laughed if she but opened her mouth. They no longer\nwondered that Gilbert had married a wife so much older than himself.\nThey saw that Jane was a woman with whom age did not count. They thought\nhim a devilish lucky young fellow. The admiral quoted Shakespeare to me:\n\"Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety.\" Gilbert\nwas delighted with her success. As I came to know him better I grew to\nlike him. It was quite evident that he was neither a rascal nor a\nfortune-hunter. He was not only immensely proud of Jane but genuinely\ndevoted to her. His kindness to her was touching. He was a very\nunselfish and sweet-tempered young man.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what do you think of Jane now?\" he said to me once, with boyish\ntriumph.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know which of you is more wonderful,\" I said. \"You or she.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I'm nothing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nonsense. You don't think I'm such a fool as not to see that it's you,\nand you only, who've made Jane what she is.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My only merit is that I saw what was there when it wasn't obvious to\nthe naked eye,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can understand your seeing that she had in her the possibility of\nthat remarkable appearance, but how in the world have you made her into\na humorist?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I always thought the things she said a perfect scream. She was\nalways a humorist.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're the only person who ever thought so.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower, not without magnanimity, acknowledged that she had been\nmistaken in Gilbert. She grew quite attached to him. But notwithstanding\nappearances she never faltered in her opinion that the marriage could\nnot last. I was obliged to laugh at her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, I've never seen such a devoted couple,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gilbert is twenty-seven now. It's just the time for a pretty girl to\ncome along. Did you notice the other evening at Jane's that pretty\nlittle niece of Sir Reginald's? I thought Jane was looking at them both\nwith a good deal of attention, and I wondered to myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't believe Jane fears the rivalry of any girl under the sun.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wait and see,\" said Mrs. Tower.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You gave it six months.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, now I give it three years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen anyone is very positive in an opinion it is only human nature to\nwish him proved wrong. Mrs. Tower was really too cocksure. But such a\nsatisfaction was not mine, for the end that she had always and\nconfidently predicted to the ill-assorted match did in point of fact\ncome. Still, the fates seldom give us what we want in the way we want\nit, and though Mrs. Tower could flatter herself that she had been right,\nI think after all she would sooner have been wrong. For things did not\nhappen at all in the way she expected.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne day I received an urgent message from her and fortunately went to\nsee her at once. When I was shown into the room Mrs. Tower rose from her\nchair and came towards me with the stealthy swiftness of a leopard\nstalking his prey. I saw that she was excited.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Jane and Gilbert have separated,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not really? Well, you were right after all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower looked at me with an expression I could not understand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor Jane,\" I muttered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor Jane!\" she repeated, but in tones of such derision that I was\ndumbfounded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe found some difficulty in telling me exactly what had occurred.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGilbert had left her a moment before she leaped to the telephone to\nsummon me. When he entered the room, pale and distraught, she saw at\nonce that something terrible had happened. She knew what he was going to\nsay before he said it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Marion, Jane has left me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a little smile and took his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I knew you'd behave like a gentleman. It would have been dreadful for\nher for people to think that <i>you</i> had left her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've come to you because I knew I could count on your sympathy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I don't blame you, Gilbert,\" said Mrs. Tower, very kindly. \"It was\nbound to happen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose so. I couldn't hope to keep her always. She was too wonderful\nand I'm a perfectly commonplace fellow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower patted his hand. He was really behaving beautifully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what is going to happen now?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, she's going to divorce me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Jane always said she'd put no obstacle in your way if ever you wanted\nto marry a girl.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't think it's likely I should ever be willing to marry anyone\nelse after being Jane's husband,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower was puzzled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course you mean that <i>you've</i> left Jane.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I? That's the last thing I should ever do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then why is she divorcing you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's going to marry Sir Reginald Frobisher as soon as the decree is\nmade absolute.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower positively screamed. Then she felt so faint that she had to\nget her smelling salts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After all you've done for her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've done nothing for her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean to say you're going to allow yourself to be made use of\nlike that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We arranged before we married that if either of us wanted his liberty\nthe other should put no hindrance in the way.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But that was done on your account. Because you were twenty-seven years\nyounger than she was.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it's come in very useful for her,\" he answered bitterly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower expostulated, argued and reasoned; but Gilbert insisted that\nno rules applied to Jane, and he must do exactly what she wanted. He\nleft Mrs. Tower prostrate. It relieved her a good deal to give me a full\naccount of this interview. It pleased her to see that I was as surprised\nas herself and if I was not so indignant with Jane as she was she\nascribed that to the criminal lack of morality incident to my sex. She\nwas still in a state of extreme agitation when the door was opened and\nthe butler showed in--Jane herself. She was dressed in black and white\nas no doubt befitted her slightly ambiguous position, but in a dress so\noriginal and fantastic, in a hat so striking, that I positively gasped\nat the sight of her. But she was as ever bland and collected. She came\nforward to kiss Mrs. Tower, but Mrs. Tower withdrew herself with icy\ndignity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gilbert has been here,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I know,\" smiled Jane. \"I told him to come and see you. I'm going\nto Paris to-night and I want you to be very kind to him while I am away.\nI'm afraid just at first he'll be rather lonely and I shall feel more\ncomfortable if I can count on your keeping an eye on him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower clasped her hands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gilbert has just told me something that I can hardly bring myself to\nbelieve. He tells me that you're going to divorce him to marry Reginald\nFrobisher.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you remember, before I married Gilbert you advised me to marry a\nman of my own age? The admiral is fifty-three.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But, Jane, you owe everything to Gilbert,\" said Mrs. Tower indignantly.\n\"You wouldn't exist without him. Without him to design your clothes,\nyou'll be nothing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, he's promised to go on designing my clothes,\" Jane answered\nblandly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No woman could want a better husband. He's always been kindness itself\nto you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I know he's been sweet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How <i>can</i> you be so heartless?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I was never in love with Gilbert,\" said Jane. \"I always told him\nthat. I'm beginning to feel the need of the companionship of a man of my\nown age. I think I've probably been married to Gilbert long enough. The\nyoung have no conversation.\" She paused a little and gave us both a\ncharming smile. \"Of course I shan't lose sight of Gilbert. I've arranged\nthat with Reginald. The admiral has a niece that would just suit him. As\nsoon as we're married we'll ask them to stay with us at Malta--you know\nthat the admiral is to have the Mediterranean Command--and I shouldn't\nbe at all surprised if they fell in love with one another.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower gave a little sniff.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And have you arranged with the admiral that if you want your liberty\nneither should put any hindrance in the way of the other?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suggested it,\" Jane answered with composure. \"But the admiral says he\nknows a good thing when he sees it and he won't want to marry anyone\nelse, and if anyone wants to marry me--he has eight twelve-inch guns on\nhis flagship and he'll discuss the matter at short range.\" She gave us a\nlook through her eyeglass which even the fear of Mrs. Tower's wrath\ncould not prevent me from laughing at. \"I think the admiral's a very\npassionate man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Tower indeed gave me an angry frown.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never thought you funny, Jane,\" she said. \"I never understood why\npeople laughed at the things you said.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never thought I was funny myself, Marion,\" smiled Jane, showing her\nbright, regular teeth. \"I am glad to leave London before too many people\ncome round to our opinion.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish you'd tell me the secret of your astonishing success,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe turned to me with that bland, homely look I knew so well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, when I married Gilbert and settled in London and people began\nto laugh at what I said no one was more surprised than I was. I'd said\nthe same things for thirty years and no one ever saw anything to laugh\nat. I thought it must be my clothes or my bobbed hair or my eyeglass.\nThen I discovered it was because I spoke the truth. It was so unusual\nthat people thought it humorous. One of these days someone else will\ndiscover the secret and when people habitually tell the truth of course\nthere'll be nothing funny in it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And why am I the only person not to think it funny?\" asked Mrs. Tower.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJane hesitated a little as though she were honestly searching for a\nsatisfactory explanation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps you don't know the truth when you see it, Marion dear,\" she\nanswered in her mild good-natured way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt certainly gave her the last word. I felt that Jane would always have\nthe last word. She <i>was</i> priceless.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThere is no place in Malaya that has more charm than Tanah Merah. It\nlies on the sea and the sandy shore is fringed with casuarinas. The\ngovernment offices are still in the old Raad Huis that the Dutch built\nwhen they owned the land, and on the hill stand the grey ruins of the\nfort by aid of which the Portuguese maintained their hold over the\nunruly natives. Tanah Merah has a history and in the vast labyrinthine\nhouses of the Chinese merchants, backing on the sea so that in the cool\nof the evening they may sit in their loggias and enjoy the salt breeze,\nfamilies dwell that have been settled in the country for three\ncenturies. Many have forgotten their native language and hold\nintercourse with one another in Malay and pidgin English. The\nimagination lingers here gratefully, for in the Federated Malay States\nthe only past is within the memory for the most part of the fathers of\nliving men.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTanah Merah was for long the busiest mart of the Middle East and its\nharbour was crowded with shipping when the clipper and the junk still\nsailed the China seas. But now it is dead. It has the sad and romantic\nair of all places that have once been of importance and live now on the\nrecollection of a vanished grandeur. It is a sleepy little town and\nstrangers that come to it, losing their native energy, insensibly drop\ninto its easy and lethargic ways. Successive rubber booms bring it no\nprosperity and the ensuing slumps hasten its decay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe European quarter is very silent. It is trim and neat and clean. The\nhouses of the white men--government servants and agents of\ncompanies--stand round an immense padang, agreeable and roomy bungalows\nshaded by great cassias, and the padang is vast and green and well cared\nfor, like the lawn of a cathedral close, and indeed there is in the\naspect of this corner of Tanah Merah something quiet and delicately\nsecluded that reminds you of the precincts of Canterbury.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe club faces the sea; it is a spacious but shabby building; it has an\nair of neglect and when you enter you feel that you intrude. It gives\nyou the impression that it is closed really, for alterations and\nrepairs, and that you have taken indiscreet advantage of an open door to\ngo where you are not wanted. In the morning you may find there a couple\nof planters who have come in from their estates on business and are\ndrinking a gin-sling before starting back again; and latish in the\nafternoon a lady or two may perhaps be seen looking with a furtive air\nthrough old numbers of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>. At nightfall a few\nmen saunter in and sit about the billiard-room watching the play and\ndrinking sukus. But on Wednesdays there is a little more animation. On\nthat day the gramophone is set going in the large room upstairs and\npeople come in from the surrounding country to dance. There are\nsometimes no less than a dozen couples and it is even possible to make\nup two tables of bridge.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was on one of these occasions that I met the Cartwrights. I was\nstaying with a man called Gaze who was head of the police and he came\ninto the billiard-room, where I was sitting, and asked me if I would\nmake up a four. The Cartwrights were planters and they came in to Tanah\nMerah on Wednesdays because it gave their girl a chance of a little fun.\nThey were very nice people, said Gaze, quiet and unobtrusive, and played\na very pleasant game of bridge. I followed Gaze into the card-room and\nwas introduced to them. They were already seated at a table and Mrs.\nCartwright was shuffling the cards. It inspired me with confidence to\nsee the competent way in which she did it. She took half the pack in\neach hand, and her hands were large and strong, deftly inserted the\ncorners of one half under the corners of the other, and with a click and\na neat bold gesture cascaded the cards together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt had all the effect of a conjuring trick. The card-player knows that\nit can be done perfectly only after incessant practice. He can be fairly\nsure that anyone who can so shuffle a pack of cards loves cards for\ntheir own sake.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mind if my husband and I play together?\" asked Mrs. Cartwright.\n\"It's no fun for us to win one another's money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe cut for deal and Gaze and I sat down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Cartwright drew an ace and while she dealt, quickly and neatly,\nchatted with Gaze of local affairs. But I was aware that she took stock\nof me. She looked shrewd, but good-natured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was a woman somewhere in the fifties (though in the East, where\npeople age quickly, it is difficult to tell their ages), with white hair\nvery untidily arranged, and a constant gesture with her was an impatient\nmovement of the hand to push back a long wisp of hair that kept falling\nover her forehead. You wondered why she did not, by the use of a hairpin\nor two, save herself so much trouble. Her blue eyes were large, but pale\nand a little tired; her face was lined and sallow; I think it was her\nmouth that gave it the expression which I felt was characteristic of\ncaustic but tolerant irony. You saw that here was a woman who knew her\nmind and was never afraid to speak it. She was a chatty player (which\nsome people object to strongly, but which does not disconcert me, for I\ndo not see why you should behave at the card-table as though you were at\na memorial service) and it was soon apparent that she had an effective\nknack of badinage. It was pleasantly acid, but it was amusing enough to\nbe offensive only to a fool. If now and then she uttered a remark so\nsarcastic that you wanted all your sense of humour to see the fun in it,\nyou could not but quickly see that she was willing to take as much as\nshe gave. Her large, thin mouth broke into a dry smile and her eyes\nshone brightly when by a lucky chance you brought off a repartee that\nturned the laugh against her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI thought her a very agreeable person. I liked her frankness. I liked\nher quick wit. I liked her plain face. I never met a woman who obviously\ncared so little how she looked. It was not only her head that was\nuntidy, everything about her was slovenly; she wore a high-necked silk\nblouse, but for coolness had unbuttoned the top buttons and showed a\ngaunt and withered neck; the blouse was crumpled and none too clean, for\nshe smoked innumerable cigarettes and covered herself with ash. When she\ngot up for a moment to speak to somebody I saw that her blue skirt was\nrather ragged at the hem and badly needed a brush, and she wore heavy,\nlow-heeled boots. But none of this mattered. Everything she wore was\nperfectly in character.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd it was a pleasure to play bridge with her. She played very quickly,\nwithout hesitation, and she had not only knowledge but flair. Of course\nshe knew Gaze's game, but I was a stranger and she soon took my measure.\nThe team-work between her husband and herself was admirable; he was\nsound and cautious, but knowing him, she was able to be bold with\nassurance and brilliant with safety. Gaze was a player who founded a\nfoolish optimism on the hope that his opponents would not have the sense\nto take advantage of his errors, and the pair of us were no match for\nthe Cartwrights. We lost one rubber after another, and there was nothing\nto do but smile and look as if we liked it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what's the matter with the cards,\" said Gaze at last,\nplaintively. \"Even when we have every card in the pack we go down.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It can't be anything to do with your play,\" answered Mrs. Cartwright,\nlooking him full in the face with those pale blue eyes of hers, \"it must\nbe bad luck pure and simple. Now if you hadn't had your hearts mixed up\nwith your diamonds in that last hand you'd have saved the game.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGaze began to explain at length how the misfortune, which had cost us\ndear, occurred, but Mrs. Cartwright, with a deft flick of the hand,\nspread out the cards in a great circle so that we should cut for deal.\nCartwright looked at the time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This will have to be the last, my dear,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, will it?\" She glanced at her watch and then called to a young man\nwho was passing through the room. \"Oh, Mr. Bullen, if you're going\nupstairs tell Olive that we shall be going in a few minutes.\" She turned\nto me. \"It takes us the best part of an hour to get back to the estate\nand poor Theo has to be up at the crack of dawn.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, well, we only come in once a week,\" said Cartwright, \"and it's the\none chance Olive gets of being gay and abandoned.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI thought Cartwright looked tired and old. He was a man of middle\nheight, with a bald, shiny head, a stubbly grey moustache, and\ngold-rimmed spectacles. He wore white ducks and a black-and-white tie.\nHe was rather neat and you could see he took much more pains with his\nclothes than his untidy wife. He talked little, but it was plain that he\nenjoyed his wife's caustic humour and sometimes he made quite a neat\nretort. They were evidently very good friends. It was pleasing to see so\nsolid and tolerant an affection between two people who were almost\nelderly and must have lived together for so many years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt took but two hands to finish the rubber and we had just ordered a\nfinal gin and bitters when Olive came down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you really want to go already, Mumsey?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Cartwright looked at her daughter with fond eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, darling. It's nearly half-past eight. It'll be ten before we get\nour dinner.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damn our dinner,\" said Olive, gaily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let her have one more dance before we go,\" suggested Cartwright\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not one. You must have a good night's rest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCartwright looked at Olive with a smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If your mother has made up her mind, my dear, we may just as well give\nin without any fuss.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's a determined woman,\" said Olive, lovingly stroking her mother's\nwrinkled cheek.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Cartwright patted her daughter's hand, and kissed it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOlive was not very pretty, but she looked extremely nice. She was\nnineteen or twenty, I suppose, and she had still the plumpness of her\nage; she would be more attractive when she had fined down a little. She\nhad none of the determination that gave her mother's face so much\ncharacter, but resembled her father; she had his dark eyes and slightly\naquiline nose, and his look of rather weak good nature. It was plain\nthat she was strong and healthy. Her cheeks were red and her eyes\nbright. She had a vitality that he had long since lost. She seemed to be\nthe perfectly normal English girl, with high spirits, a great desire to\nenjoy herself, and an excellent temper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen we separated, Gaze and I set out to walk to his house.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did you think of the Cartwrights?\" he asked me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I liked them. They must be a great asset in a place like this.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish they came oftener. They live a very quiet life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must be dull for the girl. The father and mother seem very well\nsatisfied with one another's company.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, it's been a great success.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Olive is the image of her father, isn't she?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGaze gave me a sidelong glance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Cartwright isn't her father. Mrs. Cartwright was a widow when he\nmarried her. Olive was born four months after her father's death.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI drew out the sound in order to put in it all I could of surprise,\ninterest and curiosity. But Gaze said nothing and we walked the rest of\nthe way in silence. The boy was waiting at the door as we entered the\nhouse and after a last gin pahit we sat down to dinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt first Gaze was inclined to be talkative. Owing to the restriction of\nthe output of rubber there had sprung up a considerable activity among\nthe smugglers and it was part of his duty to circumvent their\nknavishness. Two junks had been captured that day and he was rubbing his\nhands over his success. The go-downs were full of confiscated rubber and\nin a little while it was going to be solemnly burnt. But presently he\nfell into silence and we finished without a word. The boys brought in\ncoffee and brandy and we lit our cheroots. Gaze leaned back in his\nchair. He looked at me reflectively and then looked at his brandy. The\nboys had left the room and we were alone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've known Mrs. Cartwright for over twenty years,\" he said slowly. \"She\nwasn't a bad-looking woman in those days. Always untidy, but when she\nwas young it didn't seem to matter so much. It was rather attractive.\nShe was married to a man called Bronson. Reggie Bronson. He was a\nplanter. He was manager of an estate up in Selantan and I was stationed\nat Alor Lipis. It was a much smaller place than it is now; I don't\nsuppose there were more than twenty people in the whole community, but\nthey had a jolly little club, and we used to have a very good time. I\nremember the first time I met Mrs. Bronson as though it was yesterday.\nThere were no cars in those days and she and Bronson had ridden in on\ntheir bicycles. Of course then she didn't look so determined as she\nlooks now. She was much thinner, she had a nice colour, and her eyes\nwere very pretty--blue, you know--and she had a lot of dark hair. If\nshe'd only taken more trouble with herself she'd have been rather\nstunning. As it was she was the best-looking woman there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI tried to construct in my mind a picture of what Mrs. Cartwright--Mrs.\nBronson as she was then--looked like from what she was now and from\nGaze's not very graphic description. In the solid woman, with her\nwell-covered bones, who sat rather heavily at the bridge-table, I tried\nto see a slight young thing with buoyant movements and graceful, easy\ngestures. Her chin now was square and her nose decided, but the\nroundness of youth must have masked this: she must have been charming\nwith a pink-and-white skin and her hair, carelessly dressed, brown and\nabundant. At that period she wore a long skirt, a tight waist and a\npicture hat. Or did women in Malaya still wear the topees that you see\nin old numbers of the illustrated papers?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hadn't seen her for--oh, nearly twenty years,\" Gaze went on. \"I knew\nshe was living somewhere in the F.M.S., but it was a surprise when I\ntook this job and came here to run across her in the club just as I had\nup in Selantan so many years before. Of course she's an elderly woman\nnow and she's changed out of all recognition. It was rather a shock to\nsee her with a grown-up daughter, it made me realise how the time had\npassed; I was a young fellow when I met her last and now, by Jingo, I'm\ndue to retire on the age limit in two or three years. Bit thick, isn't\nit?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGaze, a rueful grin on his ugly face, looked at me with faint\nindignation, as though I could help the hurrying march of the years as\nthey trod upon one another's heels.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm no chicken myself,\" I replied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You haven't lived out East all your life. It ages one before one's\ntime. One's an elderly man at fifty and at fifty-five one's good for\nnothing but the scrap-heap.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut I did not want Gaze to wander off into a disquisition on old age.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you recognise Mrs. Cartwright when you saw her again?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I did and I didn't. At the first glance I thought I knew her, but\ncouldn't quite place her. I thought perhaps she was someone I'd met on\nboard ship when I was going on leave and had known only by sight. But\nthe moment she spoke I remembered at once. I remembered the dry twinkle\nin her eyes and the crisp sound of her voice. There was something in her\nvoice that seemed to mean: You're a bit of a damned fool, my lad, but\nyou're not a bad sort and upon my soul I rather like you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's a good deal to read into the sound of a voice,\" I smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She came up to me in the club and shook hands with me. 'How do you do,\nMajor Gaze? Do you remember me?' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Of course I do.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'A lot of water has passed under the bridge since we met last. We're\nnone of us as young as we were. Have you seen Theo?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For a moment I couldn't think whom she meant. I suppose I looked rather\nstupid, because she gave a little smile, that chaffing smile that I knew\nso well, and explained.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I married Theo, you know. It seemed the best thing to do. I was lonely\nand he wanted it.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I heard you married him,' I said. 'I hope you've been very happy.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, very. Theo's a perfect duck. He'll be here in a minute. He'll be\nso glad to see you.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wondered. I should have thought I was the last man Theo would wish to\nsee. I shouldn't have thought she would wish it very much either. But\nwomen are funny.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why shouldn't she wish to see you?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm coming to that later,\" said Gaze. \"Then Theo turned up. I don't\nknow why I call him Theo; I never called him anything but Cartwright, I\nnever thought of him as anything but Cartwright. Theo was a shock. You\nknow what he looks like now; I remembered him as a curly-headed\nyoungster, very fresh and clean-looking he was always neat and dapper,\nhe had a good figure and he held himself well, like a man who's used to\ntaking a lot of exercise. Now I come to think of it he wasn't\nbad-looking, not in a big, massive way, but graceful, you know, and\nlithe. When I saw this bowed, cadaverous, bald-headed old buffer with\nspectacles I could hardly believe my eyes. I shouldn't have known him\nfrom Adam. He seemed pleased to see me, at least, interested; he wasn't\neffusive, but he'd always been on the quiet side and I didn't expect him\nto be.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Are you surprised to find us here?' he asked me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Well, I hadn't the faintest notion where you were.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'We've kept track of your movements more or less. We've seen your name\nin the paper every now and then. You must come out one day and have a\nlook at our place. We've been settled there a good many years, and I\nsuppose we shall stay there till we go home for good. Have you ever been\nback to Alor Lipis?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No, I haven't,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It was a nice little place. I'm told it's grown. I've never been\nback.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It hasn't got the pleasantest recollections for us,' said Mrs.\nCartwright.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I asked them if they'd have a drink and we called the boy. I dare say\nyou noticed that Mrs. Cartwright likes her liquor; I don't mean that she\ngets tight or anything like that, but she drinks her stengah like a man.\nI couldn't help looking at them with a certain amount of curiosity. They\nseemed perfectly happy; I gathered that they hadn't done at all badly,\nand I found out later that they were quite well off. They had a very\nnice car, and when they went on leave they denied themselves nothing.\nThey were on the best of terms with one another. You know how jolly it\nis to see two people who've been married a great many years obviously\nbetter pleased with their own company than anyone else's. Their marriage\nhad evidently been a great success. And they were both of them devoted\nto Olive and very proud of her, Theo especially.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Although she was only his step-daughter?\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Although she was only his step-daughter,\" answered Gaze. \"You'd think\nthat she would have taken his name. But she hadn't. She called him\nDaddy, of course, he was the only father she'd ever known, but she\nsigned her letters, Olive Bronson.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What was Bronson like, by the way?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bronson? He was a great big fellow, very hearty, with a loud voice and\na bellowing laugh, beefy, you know, and a fine athlete. There was not\nvery much to him, but he was as straight as a die. He had a red face and\nred hair. Now I come to think of it I remember that I never saw a man\nsweat as much as he did. Water just poured off him, and when he played\ntennis he always used to bring a towel on the court with him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It doesn't sound very attractive.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was a handsome chap. He was always fit. He was keen on that. He\nhadn't much to talk about but rubber and games, tennis, you know, and\ngolf and shooting; and I don't suppose he read a book from year's end to\nyear's end. He was the typical public-school boy. He was about\nthirty-five when I first knew him, but he had the mind of a boy of\neighteen. You know how many fellows when they come out East seem to stop\ngrowing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did indeed. One of the most disconcerting things to the traveller is\nto see stout, middle-aged gentlemen, with bald heads, speaking and\nacting like schoolboys. You might almost think that no idea has entered\ntheir heads since they first passed through the Suez Canal. Though\nmarried and the fathers of children, and perhaps in control of a large\nbusiness, they continue to look upon life from the standpoint of the\nsixth form.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But he was no fool,\" Gaze went on. \"He knew his work from A to Z. His\nestate was one of the best managed in the country and he knew how to\nhandle his labour. He was a damned good sort, and if he did get on your\nnerves a little you couldn't help liking him. He was generous with his\nmoney, and always ready to do anybody a good turn. That's how Cartwright\nhappened to turn up in the first instance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did the Bronsons get on well together?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, yes, I think so. I'm sure they did. He was good-natured and she was\nvery jolly and gay. She was very outspoken, you know. She can be damned\namusing when she likes even now, but there's generally a sting lurking\nin the joke; when she was a young woman and married to Bronson it was\njust pure fun. She had high spirits and liked having a good time. She\nnever cared a hang what she said, but it went with her type, if you\nunderstand what I mean; there was something so open and frank and\ncareless about her that you didn't care what she said to you. They\nseemed very happy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Their estate was about five miles from Alor Lipis. They had a trap and\nthey used to drive in most evenings about five. Of course it was a very\nsmall community and men were in the majority. There were only about six\nwomen. The Bronsons were a god-send. They bucked things up the moment\nthey arrived. We used to have very jolly times in that little club. I've\noften thought of them since and I don't know that on the whole I've ever\nenjoyed myself more than I did when I was stationed there. Between six\nand eight-thirty the club at Alor Lipis twenty years ago was about as\nlively a place as you could find between Aden and Yokohama.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One day Mrs. Bronson told us that they were expecting a friend to stay\nwith them and a few days later they brought Cartwright along. It\nappeared that he was an old friend of Bronson's, they'd been at school\ntogether, Marlborough, or some place like that, and they'd first come\nout East on the same ship. Rubber had taken a toss and a lot of fellows\nhad lost their jobs. Cartwright was one of them. He'd been out of work\nfor the greater part of a year and he hadn't anything to fall back on.\nIn those days planters were even worse paid than they are now and a man\nhad to be very lucky to put by something for a rainy day. Cartwright had\ngone to Singapore. They all go there when there's a slump, you know.\nIt's awful then, I've seen it; I've known of planters sleeping in the\nstreet because they hadn't the price of a night's lodging. I've known\nthem stop strangers outside the Europe and ask for a dollar to get a\nmeal, and I think Cartwright had had a pretty rotten time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At last he wrote to Bronson and asked him if he couldn't do something\nfor him. Bronson asked him to come and stay till things got better, at\nleast it would be free board and lodging, and Cartwright jumped at the\nchance, but Bronson had to send him the money to pay his railway fare.\nWhen Cartwright arrived at Alor Lipis he hadn't ten cents in his pocket.\nBronson had a little money of his own, two or three hundred a year, I\nthink, and though his salary had been cut, he'd kept his job, so that he\nwas better off than most planters. When Cartwright came Mrs. Bronson\ntold him that he was to look upon the place as his home and stay as long\nas he liked.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was very nice of her, wasn't it?\" I remarked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGaze lit himself another cheroot and filled his glass. It was very still\nand but for the occasional croak of the chik-chak the silence was\nintense. We seemed to be alone in the tropical night and heaven only\nknows how far from the habitations of men. Gaze did not speak for so\nlong that at last I was forced to say something.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What sort of a man was Cartwright at that time?\" I asked. \"Younger, of\ncourse, and you told me rather nice-looking; but in himself?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, to tell you the truth, I never paid much attention to him. He was\npleasant and unassuming. He's very quiet now, as I dare say you noticed;\nwell, he wasn't exactly lively then. But he was perfectly inoffensive.\nHe was fond of reading and he played the piano rather nicely. You never\nminded having him about, he was never in the way, but you never bothered\nvery much about him. He danced well and the women rather liked that, but\nhe also played billiards quite decently and he wasn't bad at tennis. He\nfell into our little groove very naturally. I wouldn't say that he ever\nbecame wildly popular, but everybody liked him. Of course we were sorry\nfor him, as one is for a man who's down and out, but there was nothing\nwe could do, and, well, we just accepted him and then forgot that he\nhadn't always been there. He used to come in with the Bronsons every\nevening and pay for his drinks like everyone else, I suppose Bronson had\nlent him a bit of money for current expenses, and he was always very\ncivil. I'm rather vague about him, because really he didn't make any\nparticular impression on me; in the East one meets such a lot of people,\nand he seemed very much like anybody else. He did everything he could to\nget something to do, but he had no luck; the fact is, there were no jobs\ngoing, and sometimes he seemed rather depressed about it. He was with\nthe Bronsons for over a year. I remember his saying to me once:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'After all I can't live with them for ever. They've been most awfully\ngood to me, but there are limits.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I should think the Bronsons would be very glad to have you,' I said.\n'It's not particularly gay on a rubber estate, and as far as your food\nand drink go, it must make precious little difference if you're there or\nnot.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGaze stopped once more and looked at me with a sort of hesitation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I'm telling you this story very badly,\" he said. \"I seem to\nbe just rambling on. I'm not a damned novelist, I'm a policeman, and I'm\njust telling you the facts as I saw them at the time; and from my point\nof view all the circumstances are important; it's important, I mean, to\nrealise what sort of people they were.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course. Fire away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I remember someone, a woman, I think it was, the doctor's wife, asking\nMrs. Bronson if she didn't get tired sometimes of having a stranger in\nthe house. You know, in places like Alor Lipis there isn't very much to\ntalk about, and if you didn't talk about your neighbours there'd be\nnothing to talk about at all.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, no,' she said, 'Theo's no trouble.' She turned to her husband, who\nwas sitting there mopping his face. 'We like having him, don't we?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He's all right,' said Bronson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What does he do with himself all day long?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, I don't know,' said Mrs. Bronson. 'He walks round the estate with\nReggie sometimes, and he shoots a bit. He talks to me.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He's always glad to make himself useful,' said Bronson. 'The other day\nwhen I had a go of fever, he took over my work and I just lay in bed and\nhad a good time.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hadn't the Bronsons any children?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No,\" Gaze answered. \"I don't know why, they could well have afforded\nit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGaze leant back in his chair. He took off his glasses and wiped them.\nThey were very strong and hideously distorted his eyes. Without them he\nwasn't so homely. The chik-chak on the ceiling gave its strangely human\ncry. It was like the cackle of an idiot child.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bronson was killed,\" said Gaze suddenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Killed?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, murdered. I shall never forget that night. We'd been playing\ntennis, Mrs. Bronson and the doctor's wife, Theo Cartwright and I; and\nthen we played bridge. Cartwright had been off his game and when we sat\ndown at the bridge-table Mrs. Bronson said to him: 'Well, Theo, if you\nplay bridge as rottenly as you played tennis we shall lose our shirts.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'd just had a drink, but she called the boy and ordered another\nround.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Put that down your throat,' she said to him, 'and don't call without\ntop honours and an outside trick.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bronson hadn't turned up, he'd cycled in to Kabulong to get the money\nto pay his coolies their wages and was to come along to the club when he\ngot back. The Bronsons' estate was nearer Alor Lipis than it was to\nKabulong, but Kabulong was a more important place commercially, and\nBronson banked there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Reggie can cut in when he turns up,' said Mrs. Bronson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He's late, isn't he?' said the doctor's wife.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Very. He said he wouldn't get back in time for tennis, but would be\nhere for a rubber. I have a suspicion that he went to the club at\nKabulong instead of coming straight home and is having drinks, the\nruffian.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, well, he can put away a good many without their having much effect\non him,' I laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He's getting fat, you know. He'll have to be careful.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We sat by ourselves in the card-room and we could hear the crowd in the\nbilliard-room talking and laughing. They were all on the merry side. It\nwas getting on to Christmas Day and we were all letting ourselves go a\nlittle. There was going to be a dance on Christmas Eve.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I remembered afterwards that when we sat down the doctor's wife asked\nMrs. Bronson if she wasn't tired.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Not a bit,' she said. 'Why should I be?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know why she flushed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I was afraid the tennis might have been too much for you,' said the\ndoctor's wife.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, no,' answered Mrs. Bronson, a trifle abruptly, I thought, as\nthough she didn't want to discuss the matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know what they meant, and indeed it wasn't till later that I\nremembered the incident.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We played three or four rubbers and still Bronson didn't turn up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I wonder what's happened to him,' said his wife. 'I can't think why he\nshould be so late.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Cartwright was always silent, but this evening he had hardly opened his\nmouth. I thought he was tired and asked him what he'd been doing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Nothing very much,' he said. 'I went out after tiffin to shoot\npigeon.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Did you have any luck?' I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, I got half a dozen. They were very shy.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But now he said: 'If Reggie got back late, I dare say he thought it\nwasn't worth while to come here. I expect he's had a bath and when we\nget in we shall find him asleep in his chair.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It's a good long ride from Kabulong,' said the doctor's wife.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He doesn't take the road, you know,' Mrs. Bronson explained. 'He takes\nthe short cut through the jungle.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Can he get along on his bicycle?' I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, yes, it's a very good track. It saves about a couple of miles.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We had just started another rubber when the bar-boy came in and said\nthere was a police-sergeant outside who wanted to speak to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What does he want?' I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The boy said he didn't know, but he had two coolies with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Curse him,' I said. 'I'll give him hell if I find he's disturbed me\nfor nothing.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I told the boy I'd come and I finished playing the hand. Then I got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I won't be a minute,' I said. 'Deal for me, will you?' I added to\nCartwright.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I went out and found the sergeant with two Malays waiting for me on the\nsteps. I asked him what the devil he wanted. You can imagine my\nconsternation when he told me that the Malays had come to the\npolice-station and said there was a white man lying dead on the path\nthat led through the jungle to Kabulong. I immediately thought of\nBronson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Dead?' I cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Yes, shot. Shot through the head. A white man with red hair.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then I knew it was Reggie Bronson, and indeed, one of them naming his\nestate said he'd recognised him as the man. It was an awful shock. And\nthere was Mrs. Bronson in the card-room waiting impatiently for me to\nsort my cards and make a bid. For a moment I really didn't know what to\ndo. I was frightfully upset. It was dreadful to give her such a terrible\nand unexpected blow without a word of preparation, but I found myself\nquite unable to think of any way to soften it. I told the sergeant and\nthe coolies to wait and went back into the club. I tried to pull myself\ntogether. As I entered the card-room Mrs. Bronson said: 'You've been an\nawful long time.' Then she caught sight of my face. 'Is anything the\nmatter?' I saw her clench her fists and go white. You'd have thought she\nhad a presentiment of evil.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Something dreadful has happened,' I said, and my throat was all closed\nup so that my voice sounded even to myself hoarse and uncanny. 'There's\nbeen an accident. Your husband's been wounded.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She gave a long gasp, it was not exactly a scream, it reminded me oddly\nof a piece of silk torn in two.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Wounded?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She leapt to her feet and with her eyes starting from her head stared\nat Cartwright. The effect on him was ghastly, he fell back in his chair\nand went as white as death.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Very, very badly, I'm afraid,' I added.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I knew that I must tell her the truth, and tell it then, but I couldn't\nbring myself to tell it all at once.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Is he,' her lips trembled so that she could hardly form the words, 'is\nhe--conscious?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I looked at her for a moment without answering. I'd have given a\nthousand pounds not to have to.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No, I'm afraid he isn't.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Bronson stared at me as though she were trying to see right into\nmy brain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Is he dead?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought the only thing was to get it out and have done with it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Yes, he was dead when they found him.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Bronson collapsed into her chair and burst into tears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, my God,' she muttered. 'Oh, my God.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The doctor's wife went to her and put her arms round her. Mrs. Bronson\nwith her face in her hands swayed to and fro weeping hysterically.\nCartwright, with that livid face, sat quite still, his mouth open, and\nstared at her. You might have thought he was turned to stone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, my dear, my dear,' said the doctor's wife, 'you must try and pull\nyourself together.' Then, turning to me. 'Get her a glass of water and\nfetch Harry.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Harry was her husband and he was playing billiards. I went in and told\nhim what had happened.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'A glass of water be damned,' he said. 'What she wants is a good long\npeg of brandy.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We took it in to her and forced her to drink it and gradually the\nviolence of her emotion exhausted itself. In a few minutes the doctor's\nwife was able to take her into the ladies' lavatory to wash her face.\nI'd made up my mind now what had better be done. I could see that\nCartwright wasn't good for much; he was all to pieces. I could\nunderstand that it was a fearful shock to him, for after all Bronson was\nhis greatest friend and had done everything in the world for him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You look as though you'd be all the better for a drop of brandy\nyourself, old man,' I said to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He made an effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It's shaken me, you know,' he said. 'I... I didn't...' He\nstopped as though his mind was wandering; he was still fearfully pale;\nhe took out a packet of cigarettes and struck a match, but his hand was\nshaking so that he could hardly manage it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Yes, I'll have a brandy.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Boy,' I shouted, and then to Cartwright: 'Now, are you fit to take\nMrs. Bronson home?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, yes,' he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'That's good. The doctor and I will go along with the coolies and some\npolice to where the body is.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Will you bring him back to the bungalow?' asked Cartwright.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I think he'd better be taken straight to the mortuary,' said the\ndoctor before I could answer. 'I shall have to do a P.M.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When Mrs. Bronson, now so much calmer that I was amazed, came back, I\ntold her what I suggested. The doctor's wife, kind woman, offered to go\nwith her and spend the night at the bungalow, but Mrs. Bronson wouldn't\nhear of it. She said she would be perfectly all right, and when the\ndoctor's wife insisted--you know how bent some people are on forcing\ntheir kindness on those in trouble--she turned on her almost fiercely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No, no, I must be alone,' she said. 'I really must. And Theo will be\nthere.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They got into the trap. Theo took the reins and they drove off. We\nstarted after them, the doctor and I, while the sergeant and the coolies\nfollowed. I had sent my seis to the police-station with instructions to\nsend two men to the place where the body was lying. We soon passed Mrs.\nBronson and Cartwright.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'All right?' I called.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Yes,' he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For some time the doctor and I drove without saying a word; we were\nboth of us deeply shocked. I was worried as well. Somehow or other I'd\ngot to find the murderers and I foresaw that it would be no easy matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Do you suppose it was gang robbery?' said the doctor at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He might have been reading my thoughts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I don't think there's a doubt of it,' I answered. 'They knew he'd gone\ninto Kabulong to get the wages and lay in wait for him on the way back.\nOf course he should never have come alone through the jungle when\neveryone knew he had a packet of money with him.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He'd done it for years,' said the doctor. 'And he's not the only one.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I know. The question is, how we're going to get hold of the fellows\nthat did it.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You don't think the two coolies who say they found him could have had\nanything to do with it?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No. They wouldn't have the nerve. I think a pair of Chinks might think\nout a trick like that, but I don't believe Malays would. They'd be much\ntoo frightened. Of course we'll keep an eye on them. We shall soon see\nif they seem to have any money to fling about.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It's awful for Mrs. Bronson,' said the doctor. 'It would have been bad\nenough at any time, but now she's going to have a baby...'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I didn't know that,' I said, interrupting him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No, for some reason she wanted to keep it dark. She was rather funny\nabout it, I thought.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I recollected then that little passage between Mrs. Bronson and the\ndoctor's wife. I understood why that good woman had been so anxious that\nMrs. Bronson should not overtire herself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It's strange her having a baby after being married so many years.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It happens, you know. But it was a surprise to her. When first she\ncame to see me and I told her what was the matter she fainted, and then\nshe began to cry. I should have thought she'd be as pleased as Punch.\nShe told me that Bronson didn't like children and he'd be awfully bored\nat the idea, and she made me promise to say nothing about it till she\nhad had a chance of breaking it to him gradually.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I reflected for a moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He was the kind of breezy, hearty cove whom you'd expect to be as keen\nas mustard on having kids.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You never can tell. Some people are very selfish and just don't want\nthe bother.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Well, how did he take it when she did tell him? Wasn't he rather\nbucked?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I don't know that she ever told him. Though she couldn't have waited\nmuch longer; unless I'm very much mistaken she ought to be confined in\nabout five months.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Poor devil,' I said. 'You know, I've got a notion that he'd have been\nmost awfully pleased to know.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We drove in silence for the rest of the way and at last came to the\npoint at which the short cut to Kabulong branched off from the road.\nHere we stopped and in a minute or two my trap, in which were the\npolice-sergeant and the two Malays, came up. We took the head-lamps to\nlight us on our way. I left the doctor's seis to look after the ponies\nand told him that when the policemen came they were to follow the path\ntill they found us. The two coolies, carrying the lamps, walked ahead\nand we followed them. It was a fairly broad track, wide enough for a\nsmall cart to pass, and before the road was built it had been the\nhighway between Kabulong and Alor Lipis. It was firm to the foot and\ngood walking. The surface here and there was sandy and in places you\ncould see quite plainly the mark of a bicycle wheel. It was the track\nBronson had left on his way to Kabulong.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We walked twenty minutes, I should think, in single file, and on a\nsudden the coolies, with a cry, stopped sharply. The sight had come upon\nthem so abruptly that notwithstanding they were expecting it they were\nstartled. There, in the middle of the pathway lit dimly by the lamps the\ncoolies carried, lay Bronson; he'd fallen over his bicycle and lay\nacross it in an ungainly heap. I was too shocked to speak, and I think\nthe doctor was, too. But in our silence the din of the jungle was\ndeafening; those damned cicadas and the bull-frogs were making enough\nrow to wake the dead. Even under ordinary circumstances the noise of the\njungle at night is uncanny; because you feel that at that hour there\nshould be utter silence it has an odd effect on you, that ceaseless and\ninvisible uproar that beats upon your nerves. It surrounds you and hems\nyou in. But just then, believe me, it was terrifying. That poor fellow\nlay dead and all round him the restless life of the jungle pursued its\nindifferent and ferocious course.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was lying face downwards. The sergeant and the coolies looked at me\nas though awaiting an order. I was a young fellow then and I'm afraid I\nfelt a little frightened. Though I couldn't see the face I had no doubt\nthat it was Bronson, but I felt that I ought to turn the body over to\nmake sure. I suppose we all have our little squeamishnesses; you know,\nI've always had a horrible distaste for touching dead bodies. I've had\nto do it fairly often now, but it still makes me feel slightly sick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It's Bronson, all right,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The doctor--by George, it was lucky for me he was there--the doctor\nbent down and turned the head. The sergeant directed the lamp on the\ndead face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'My God, half his head's been shot away,' I cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Yes.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The doctor stood up straight and wiped his hands on the leaves of a\ntree that grew beside the path.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Is he quite dead?' I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, yes. Death must have been instantaneous. Whoever shot him must\nhave fired at pretty close range.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'How long has he been dead, d'you think?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, I don't know, several hours.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He would have passed here about five o'clock, I suppose, if he was\nexpecting to get to the club for a rubber at six.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'There's no sign of any struggle,' said the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No, there wouldn't be. He was shot as he was riding along.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I looked at the body for a little while. I couldn't help thinking how\nshort a time ago it was since Bronson, noisy and loud-voiced, had been\nso full of hearty life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You haven't forgotten that he had the coolies' wages on him,' said the\ndoctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No, we'd better search him.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Shall we turn him over?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Wait a minute. Let us just have a look at the ground first.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I took the lamp and as carefully as I could looked all about me. Just\nwhere he had fallen the sandy pathway was trodden and confused; there\nwere our footprints and the footprints of the coolies who had found him.\nI walked two or three paces and then saw quite clearly the mark of his\nbicycle wheels; he had been riding straight and steadily. I followed it\nto the spot where he had fallen, to just before that, rather, and there\nsaw very distinctly the prints on each side of the wheels of his heavy\nboots. He had evidently stopped there and put his feet to the ground,\nthen he'd started off again, there was a great wobble of the wheel, and\nhe'd crashed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Now let's search him,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The doctor and the sergeant turned the body over and one of the coolies\ndragged the bicycle away. They laid Bronson on his back. I supposed he\nwould have had the money partly in notes and partly in silver. The\nsilver would have been in a bag attached to the bicycle and a glance\ntold me that it was not there. The notes he would have put in a wallet.\nIt would have been a good thick bundle. I felt him all over, but there\nwas nothing; then I turned out the pockets, they were all empty except\nthe right trouser pocket, in which there was a little small change.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Didn't he always wear a watch?' asked the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Yes, of course he did.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I remembered that he wore the chain through the buttonhole in the lapel\nof his coat and the watch and some seals and things in his handkerchief\npocket. But watch and chain were gone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Well, there's not much doubt now, is there?' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was clear that he had been attacked by gang robbers who knew he had\nmoney on him. After killing him they had stripped him of everything. I\nsuddenly remembered the footprints that proved that for a moment he had\nstood still. I saw exactly how it had been done. One of them had stopped\nhim on some pretext and then, just as he started off again, another,\nslipping out of the jungle behind him, had emptied the two barrels of a\ngun into his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Well,' I said to the doctor, 'it's up to me to catch them, and I'll\ntell you what, it'll be a real pleasure to me to see them hanged.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course there was an inquest. Mrs. Bronson gave evidence, but she had\nnothing to say that we didn't know already. Bronson had left the\nbungalow about eleven, he was to have tiffin at Kabulong and was to be\nback between five and six. He asked her not to wait for him, he said he\nwould just put the money in the safe and come straight to the club.\nCartwright confirmed this. He had lunched alone with Mrs. Bronson and\nafter a smoke had gone out with a gun to shoot pigeon. He had got in\nabout five, a little before perhaps, had a bath and changed to play\ntennis. He was shooting not far from the place where Bronson was killed,\nbut never heard a shot. That, of course, meant nothing; what with the\ncicadas and the frogs and the other sounds of the jungle, he would have\nhad to be very near to hear anything; and besides, Cartwright was\nprobably back in the bungalow before Bronson was killed. We traced\nBronson's movements. He had lunched at the club, he had got money at the\nbank just before it closed, had gone back to the club and had one more\ndrink, and then started off on his bicycle. He had crossed the river by\nthe ferry; the ferryman remembered distinctly seeing him, but was\npositive that no one else with a bicycle had crossed. That looked as\nthough the murderers were not following, but lying in wait for him. He\nrode along the main road for a couple of miles and then took the path\nwhich was a short cut to his bungalow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It looked as though he had been killed by men who knew his habits, and\nsuspicion, of course, fell immediately on the coolies of his estate. We\nexamined them all--pretty carefully--but there was not a scrap of\nevidence to connect any of them with the crime. In fact, most of them\nwere able satisfactorily to account for their actions and those who\ncouldn't seemed to me for one reason and another out of the running.\nThere were a few bad characters among the Chinese at Alor Lipis and I\nhad them looked up. But somehow I didn't think it was the work of the\nChinese; I had a feeling that Chinese would have used revolvers and not\na shotgun. Anyhow, I could find out nothing there. So then we offered a\nreward of a thousand dollars to anyone who could put us in the way of\ndiscovering the murderers. I thought there were a good many people to\nwhom it would appeal to do a public service and at the same time earn a\ntidy sum. But I knew that an informer would take no risks, he wouldn't\nwant to tell what he knew till he knew he could tell it safely, and I\narmed myself with patience. The reward had brightened the interest of my\npolice and I knew they would use every means they had to bring the\ncriminals to trial. In a case like this they could do more than I.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But it was strange, nothing happened; the reward seemed to tempt no\none. I cast my net a little wider. There were two or three kampongs\nalong the road and I wondered if the murderers were there; I saw the\nheadmen, but got no help from them. It was not that they would tell me\nnothing, I was sure they had nothing to tell. I talked to the bad hats,\nbut there was absolutely nothing to connect them with the murder. There\nwas not the shadow of a clue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Very well, my lads,' I said to myself, as I drove back to Alor Lipis,\n'there's no hurry; the rope won't spoil by keeping.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The scoundrels had got away with a considerable sum, but money is no\ngood unless you spend it. I felt I knew the native temperament enough to\nbe sure that the possession of it was a constant temptation. The Malays\nare an extravagant race, and a race of gamblers, and the Chinese are\ngamblers, too; sooner or later someone would start flinging his money\nabout, and then I should want to know where it came from. With a few\nwell-directed questions I thought I could put the fear of God into the\nfellow and then, if I knew my business, it shouldn't be hard to get a\nfull confession.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The only thing now was to sit down and wait till the hue and cry had\ndied down and the murderers thought the affair was forgotten. The itch\nto spend those ill-gotten dollars would grow more and more intolerable\ntill at last it could be resisted no longer. I would go about my\nbusiness, but I meant never to relax my watch, and one day, sooner or\nlater, my time must come.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Cartwright took Mrs. Bronson down to Singapore. The company Bronson had\nworked for asked him if he would care to take Bronson's place, but he\nsaid, very naturally, that he didn't like the idea of it; so they put\nanother man in and told Cartwright that he could have the job that\nBronson's successor had vacated. It was the management of the estate\nthat Cartwright lives on now. He moved in at once. Four months after\nthis Olive was born at Singapore, and a few months later, when Bronson\nhad been dead just over a year, Cartwright and Mrs. Bronson were\nmarried. I was surprised; but on thinking it over I couldn't help\nconfessing that it was very natural. After the trouble Mrs. Bronson had\nleant much on Cartwright and he had arranged everything for her; she\nmust have been lonely, and rather lost, and I dare say she was grateful\nfor his kindness, he did behave like a brick; and so far as he was\nconcerned I imagined he was sorry for her, it was a dreadful position\nfor a woman, she had nowhere to go, and all they'd gone through must\nhave been a tie between them. There was every reason for them to marry\nand it was probably the best thing for them both.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It looked as though Bronson's murderers would never be caught, for that\nplan of mine didn't work; there was no one in the district who spent\nmore money than he could account for, and if anyone had that hoard\nburied away under his floor he was showing a self-control that was\nsuperhuman. A year had passed and to all intents and purposes the thing\nwas forgotten. Could anyone be so prudent as after so long not to let a\nlittle money dribble out? It was incredible. I began to think that\nBronson had been killed by a couple of wandering Chinese who had got\naway, to Singapore perhaps, where there would be small chance of\ncatching them. At last I gave it up. If you come to think of it, as a\nrule, it's just those crimes, crimes of robbery, in which there is least\nchance of getting the culprit; for there's nothing to attach suspicion\nto him, and if he's caught it can only be by his own carelessness. It's\ndifferent with crimes of passion or vengeance, then you can find out who\nhad a motive to put the victim out of the way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's no use grizzling over one's failures, and bringing my common sense\nto bear I did my best to put the matter out of my mind. No one likes to\nbe beaten, but beaten I was and I had to put as good a face on it as I\ncould. And then a Chinaman was caught trying to pawn poor Bronson's\nwatch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I told you that Bronson's watch and chain had been taken, and of course\nMrs. Bronson was able to give us a fairly accurate description of it. It\nwas a half-hunter, by Benson, there was a gold chain, three or four\nseals and a sovereign purse. The pawnbroker was a smart fellow and when\nthe Chinaman brought the watch he recognised it at once. On some pretext\nhe kept the man waiting and sent for a policeman. The man was arrested\nand immediately brought to me. I greeted him like a long-lost brother. I\nwas never so pleased to see anyone in my life. I have no feeling about\ncriminals, you know; I'm rather sorry for them, because they're playing\na game in which their opponents hold all the aces and kings; but when I\ncatch one it gives me a little thrill of satisfaction, like bringing off\na neat finesse at bridge. At last the mystery was going to be cleared\nup, for if the Chinaman hadn't done the thing himself we were pretty\nsure through him to trace the murderers. I beamed on him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I asked him to account for his possession of the watch. He said he had\nbought it from a man he didn't know. That was very thin. I explained the\ncircumstances briefly and told him he would be charged with murder. I\nmeant to frighten him and I did. He said then that he'd found the watch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Found it?' I said. 'Fancy that. Where?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"His answer staggered me; he said he'd found it in the jungle, I laughed\nat him; I asked him if he thought watches were likely to be left lying\nabout in the jungle; then he said he'd been coming along the pathway\nthat led from Kabulong to Alor Lipis, and had gone into the jungle and\ncaught sight of something gleaming and there was the watch. That was\nodd. Why should he have said he found the watch just there? It was\neither true or excessively astute. I asked him where the chain and the\nseals were, and he produced them immediately. I'd got him scared, and he\nwas pale and shaking; he was a knock-kneed little fellow and I should\nhave been a fool not to see that I hadn't got hold of the murderer\nthere. But his terror suggested that he knew something.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I asked him when he'd found the watch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Yesterday,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I asked him what he was doing on the short-cut from Kabulong to Alor\nLipis. He said he'd been working in Singapore and had gone to Kabulong\nbecause his father was ill, and that he himself had come to Alor Lipis\nto work. A friend of his father, a carpenter by trade, had given him a\njob. He gave me the name of the man with whom he had worked in Singapore\nand the name of the man who had engaged him at Alor Lipis. All he said\nseemed plausible and could so easily be verified that it was hardly\nlikely to be false. Of course it occurred to me that if he had found the\nwatch as he said, it must have been lying in the jungle for more than a\nyear. It could hardly be in very good condition; I tried to open it, but\ncouldn't. The pawnbroker had come to the police-station and was waiting\nin the next room. Luckily he was also something of a watch-maker. I sent\nfor him and asked him to look at the watch; when he opened it he gave a\nlittle whistle, the works were thick with rust.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'This watch no good,' he said, shaking his head. 'Him never go now.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I asked him what had put it in such a state, and without a word from me\nhe said that it had been long exposed to wet. For the moral effect I had\nthe prisoner put in a cell and I sent for his employer. I sent a wire to\nKabulong and another to Singapore. While I waited I did my best to put\ntwo and two together. I was inclined to believe the man's story true;\nhis fear might be ascribed to no more guilt than consisted in his having\nfound something and tried to sell it. Even quite innocent persons are\napt to be nervous when they're in the hands of the police; I don't know\nwhat there is about a policeman, people are never very much at their\nease in his company. But if he really had found the watch where he said,\nsomeone had thrown it there. Now that was funny. Even if the murderers\nhad thought the watch a dangerous thing to possess, one would have\nexpected them to melt down the gold case; that would be a very simple\nthing for any native to do; and the chain was of so ordinary a pattern\nthey could hardly have thought it possible to trace that. There were\nchains like it in every jeweller's shop in the country. Of course there\nwas the possibility that they had plunged into the jungle and having\ndropped the watch in their hurry had been afraid to go back and look for\nit. I didn't think that very likely: the Malays are used to keeping\nthings tucked away in their sarongs, and the Chinese have pockets in\ntheir coats. Besides, the moment they got into the jungle they knew\nthere was no hurry; they probably waited and divided the swag then and\nthere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In a few minutes the man I had sent for came to the police-station and\nconfirmed what the prisoner had said, and in an hour I got an answer\nfrom Kabulong. The police had seen his father, who told them that the\nboy had gone to Alor Lipis to get a job with a carpenter. So far\neverything he had said seemed true. I had him brought in again, and told\nhim I was going to take him to the place where he said he had found the\nwatch and he must show me the exact spot. I handcuffed him to a\npoliceman, though it was hardly necessary, for the poor devil was\nshaking with fright, and took a couple of men besides. We drove out to\nwhere the track joined the road and walked along it; within five yards\nof the place where Bronson was killed the Chinaman stopped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Here,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He pointed to the jungle and we followed him in. We went in about ten\nyards and he pointed to a chink between two large boulders and said that\nhe found the watch there. It could only have been by the merest chance\nthat he noticed it, and if he really had found it there it looked very\nmuch as though someone had put it there to hide it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGaze stopped and gave me a reflective look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What would you have thought then?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know,\" I answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'll tell you what I thought. I thought that if the watch was\nthere the money might be there, too. It seemed worth while having a\nlook. Of course, to look for something in the jungle makes looking for a\nneedle in a bundle of hay a drawing-room pastime. I couldn't help that.\nI released the Chinaman, I wanted all the help I could get, and set him\nto work. I set my three men to work, and I started in myself. We made a\nline--there were five of us--and we searched from the road; for fifty\nyards on each side of the place at which Bronson was murdered and for a\nhundred yards in we went over the ground foot by foot. We routed among\ndead leaves and peered in bushes, we looked under boulders and in the\nhollows of trees. I knew it was a foolish thing to do, for the chances\nagainst us were a thousand to one; my only hope was that anyone who had\njust committed a murder would be rattled and if he wanted to hide\nanything would hide it quickly; he would choose the first obvious\nhiding-place that offered itself. That is what he had done when he hid\nthe watch. My only reason for looking in so circumscribed an area was\nthat as the watch had been found so near the road, the person who wanted\nto get rid of the things must have wanted to get rid of them quickly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We worked on. I began to grow tired and cross. We were sweating like\npigs. I had a maddening thirst and nothing in the world to drink. At\nlast I came to the conclusion that we must give it up as a bad job, for\nthat day at least, when suddenly the Chinaman--he must have had sharp\neyes, that young man--uttered a guttural cry. He stooped down and from\nunder the winding root of a tree drew out a messy, mouldering, stinking\nthing. It was a pocket-book that had been out in the rain for a year,\nthat had been eaten by ants and beetles and God knows what, that was\nsodden and foul, but it was a pocket-book all right, Bronson's, and\ninside were the shapeless, mushed-up, fetid remains of the Singapore\nnotes he had got from the bank at Kabulong. There was still the silver\nand I was convinced that it was hidden somewhere about, but I wasn't\ngoing to bother about that. I had found out something very important;\nwhoever had murdered Bronson had made no money out of it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you remember my telling you that I'd noticed the print of Bronson's\nfeet on each side of the broad line of the pneumatic tyre, where he had\nstopped, and presumably spoken to someone? He was a heavy man and the\nprints were well marked. He hadn't just put his feet on the soft sand\nand taken them off, but must have stopped at least for a minute or two.\nMy explanation was that he had stopped to chat with a Malay or a\nChinaman, but the more I thought of it the less I liked it. Why the\ndevil should he? Bronson wanted to get home, and though a jovial chap,\nhe certainly was not hail-fellow-well-met with the natives. His\nrelations towards them were those of master and servants. Those\nfootprints had always puzzled me. And now the truth flashed across me.\nWhoever had murdered Bronson hadn't murdered him to rob and if he'd\nstopped to talk with someone it could only be with a friend. I knew at\nlast who the murderer was.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI have always thought the detective story a most diverting and ingenious\nvariety of fiction, and have regretted that I never had the skill to\nwrite one, but I have read a good many, and I flatter myself it is\nrarely that I have not solved the mystery before it was disclosed to me;\nand now for some time I had foreseen what Gaze was going to say, but\nwhen at last he said it I confess that it gave me, notwithstanding,\nsomewhat of a shock.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The man he met was Cartwright. Cartwright was pigeon-shooting. He\nstopped and asked him what sport he had had, and as he rode on\nCartwright raised his gun and discharged both barrels into his head.\nCartwright took the money and the watch in order to make it look like\nthe work of gang robbers and hurriedly hid them in the jungle, then made\nhis way along the edge till he got to the road, went back to the\nbungalow, changed into his tennis things and drove with Mrs. Bronson to\nthe club.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I remembered how badly he'd played tennis, and how he'd collapsed when,\nin order to break the news more gently to Mrs. Bronson, I said Bronson\nwas wounded and not dead. If he was only wounded he might have been able\nto speak. By George, I bet that was a bad moment. The child was\nCartwright's. Look at Olive: why, you saw the likeness yourself. The\ndoctor had said that Mrs. Bronson was upset when he told her she was\ngoing to have a baby and made him promise not to tell Bronson. Why?\nBecause Bronson knew that he couldn't be the father of the child.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think that Mrs. Bronson knew what Cartwright had done?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sure of it. When I look back on her behaviour that evening at the\nclub I am convinced of it. She was upset, but not because Bronson was\nkilled; she was upset because I said he was wounded; on my telling her\nthat he was dead when they found him she burst out crying, but from\nrelief. I know that woman. Look at that square chin of hers and tell me\nthat she hasn't got the courage of the devil. She has a will of iron.\nShe made Cartwright do it. She planned every detail and every move. He\nwas completely under her influence; he is now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But do you mean to tell me that neither you nor anyone else ever\nsuspected that there was anything between them?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never. Never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If they were in love with one another and knew that she was going to\nhave a baby, why didn't they just bolt?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How could they? It was Bronson who had the money; she hadn't a bean and\nneither had Cartwright. He was out of a job. Do you think he would have\ngot another with that story round his neck? Bronson had taken him in\nwhen he was starving and he'd stolen his wife from him. They wouldn't\nhave had a dog's chance. They couldn't afford to let the truth come out,\ntheir only chance was to get Bronson out of the way, and they got him\nout of the way.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They might have thrown themselves on his mercy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, but I think they were ashamed. He'd been so good to them, he was\nsuch a decent chap, I don't think they had the heart to tell him the\ntruth. They preferred to kill him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a moment's silence while I reflected over what Gaze said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what did you do about it?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing. What was there to do? What was the evidence? That the watch\nand notes had been found? They might easily have been hidden by someone\nwho was afterwards afraid to come and get them. The murderer might have\nbeen quite content to get away with the silver. The footprints? Bronson\nmight have stopped to light a cigarette or there might have been a\ntree-trunk across the path and he waited while the coolies he met there\nby chance moved it away. Who could prove that the child that a perfectly\ndecent, respectable woman had had four months after her husband's death\nwas not his child? No jury would have convicted Cartwright. I held my\ntongue and the Bronson murder was forgotten.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't suppose the Cartwrights have forgotten,\" I suggested.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shouldn't be surprised. Human memory is astonishingly short and if\nyou want my professional opinion I don't mind telling you that I don't\nbelieve remorse for a crime ever sits very heavily on a man when he's\nabsolutely sure he'll never be found out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI thought once more of the pair I had met that afternoon, the thin,\nelderly, bald man with gold-rimmed spectacles, and that white-haired\nuntidy woman with her frank speech and kindly, caustic smile. It was\nalmost impossible to imagine that in the distant past they had been\nswayed by so turbulent a passion, for that alone made their behaviour\nexplicable, that it had brought them in the end to such a pass that they\ncould see no other issue than a cruel and cold-blooded murder.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Doesn't it make you feel a little uncomfortable to be with them?\" I\nasked Gaze. \"For, without wishing to be censorious, I'm bound to say\nthat I don't think they can be very nice people.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's where you're wrong. They are very nice people; they're about the\npleasantest people here. Mrs. Cartwright is a thoroughly good sort and a\nvery amusing woman. It's my business to prevent crime and to catch the\nculprit when crime is committed, but I've known far too many criminals\nto think that on the whole they're worse than anybody else. A perfectly\ndecent fellow may be driven by circumstances to commit a crime and if\nhe's found out he's punished; but he may very well remain a perfectly\ndecent fellow. Of course society punishes him if he breaks its laws, and\nit's quite right, but it's not always his actions that indicate the\nessential man. If you'd been a policeman as long as I have, you'd know\nit's not what people do that really matters, it's what they are. Luckily\na policeman has nothing to do with their thoughts, only with their\ndeeds; if he had, it would be a very different, a much more difficult\nmatter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGaze flicked the ash from his cheroot and gave me his wry, sardonic, but\nagreeable smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll tell you what, there's one job I <i>shouldn't</i> like,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is that?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"God's, at the Judgment Day,\" said Gaze. \"No, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThey got a first-class carriage to themselves. It was lucky, because\nthey were taking a good deal in with them, Alban's suit-case and a\nhold-all, Anne's dressing-case and her hat-box. They had two trunks in\nthe van, containing what they wanted immediately, but all the rest of\ntheir luggage Alban had put in the care of an agent who was to take it\nup to London and store it till they had made up their minds what to do.\nThey had a lot, pictures and books, curios that Alban had collected in\nthe East, his guns and saddles. They had left Sondurah for ever. Alban,\nas was his way, tipped the porter generously and then went to the\nbookstall and bought papers. He bought the <i>New Statesman</i> and the\n<i>Nation</i>, and the <i>Tatler</i> and the <i>Sketch</i>, and the last number of the\n<i>London Mercury</i>. He came back to the carriage and threw them on the\nseat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's only an hour's journey,\" said Anne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know, but I wanted to buy them. I've been starved so long. Isn't it\ngrand to think that to-morrow morning we shall have to-morrow's <i>Times</i>,\nand the <i>Express</i> and the <i>Mail</i>?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe did not answer and he turned away, for he saw coming towards them\ntwo persons, a man and his wife, who had been fellow-passengers from\nSingapore.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Get through the Customs all right?\" he cried to them cheerily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe man seemed not to hear, for he walked straight on, but the woman\nanswered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, they never found the cigarettes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe saw Anne, gave her a friendly little smile, and passed on. Anne\nflushed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was afraid they'd want to come in here,\" said Alban. \"Let's have the\ncarriage to ourselves if we can.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him curiously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think you need worry,\" she answered. \"I don't think anyone will\ncome in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe lit a cigarette and lingered at the carriage door. On his face was a\nhappy smile. When they had passed through the Red Sea and found a sharp\nwind in the Canal, Anne had been surprised to see how much the men who\nhad looked presentable enough in the white ducks in which she had been\naccustomed to see them, were changed when they left them off for warmer\nclothes. They looked like nothing on earth then. Their ties were awful\nand their shirts all wrong. They wore grubby flannel trousers and shabby\nold golf-coats that had too obviously been bought off the nail, or blue\nserge suits that betrayed the provincial tailor. Most of the passengers\nhad got off at Marseilles, but a dozen or so, either because after a\nlong period in the East they thought the trip through the Bay would do\nthem good, or, like themselves, for economy's sake, had gone all the way\nto Tilbury, and now several of them walked along the platform. They wore\nsolar topees or double-brimmed terais, and heavy greatcoats, or else\nshapeless soft hats or bowlers, not too well brushed, that looked too\nsmall for them. It was a shock to see them. They looked suburban and a\ntrifle second-rate. But Alban had already a London look. There was not a\nspeck of dust on his smart greatcoat, and his black Homburg hat looked\nbrand-new. You would never have guessed that he had not been home for\nthree years. His collar fitted closely round his neck and his foulard\ntie was neatly tied. As Anne looked at him she could not but think how\ngood-looking he was. He was just under six feet tall, and slim, and he\nwore his clothes well, and his clothes were well cut. He had fair hair,\nstill thick, and blue eyes and the faintly yellow skin common to men of\nthat complexion after they have lost the pink-and-white freshness of\nearly youth. There was no colour in his cheeks. It was a fine head,\nwell-set on rather a long neck, with a somewhat prominent Adam's apple;\nbut you were more impressed with the distinction than with the beauty of\nhis face. It was because his features were so regular, his nose so\nstraight, his brow so broad that he photographed so well. Indeed, from\nhis photographs you would have thought him extremely handsome. He was\nnot that, perhaps because his eyebrows and his eyelashes were pale, and\nhis lips thin, but he looked very intellectual. There was refinement in\nhis face and a spirituality that was oddly moving. That was how you\nthought a poet should look; and when Anne became engaged to him she told\nher girl friends who asked her about him that he looked like Shelley. He\nturned to her now with a little smile in his blue eyes. His smile was\nvery attractive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a perfect day to land in England!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was October. They had steamed up the Channel on a grey sea under a\ngrey sky. There was not a breath of wind. The fishing boats seemed to\nrest on the placid water as though the elements had for ever forgotten\ntheir old hostility. The coast was incredibly green, but with a bright\ncosy greenness quite unlike the luxuriant, vehement verdure of Eastern\njungles. The red towns they passed here and there were comfortable and\nhomelike. They seemed to welcome the exiles with a smiling friendliness.\nAnd when they drew into the estuary of the Thames they saw the rich\nlevels of Essex and in a little while Chalk Church on the Kentish shore,\nlonely in the midst of weather-beaten trees, and beyond it the woods of\nCobham. The sun, red in a faint mist, set on the marshes, and night\nfell. In the station the arc-lamps shed a light that spotted the\ndarkness with cold hard patches. It was good to see the porters\nlumbering about in their grubby uniforms and the stationmaster fat and\nimportant in his bowler hat. The stationmaster blew a whistle and waved\nhis arm. Alban stepped into the carriage and seated himself in the\ncorner opposite to Anne. The train started.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We're due in London at six-ten,\" said Alban. \"We ought to get to Jermyn\nStreet by seven. That'll give us an hour to bath and change and we can\nget to the Savoy for dinner by eight-thirty. A bottle of pop to-night,\nmy pet, and a slap-up dinner.\" He gave a chuckle. \"I heard the Strouds\nand the Maundys arranging to meet at the Trocadero Grill-Room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took up the papers and asked if she wanted any of them. Anne shook\nher head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tired?\" he smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Excited?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn order not to answer she gave a little laugh. He began to look at the\npapers, starting with the publishers' advertisements, and she was\nconscious of the intense satisfaction it was to him to feel himself\nthrough them once more in the middle of things. They had taken in those\nsame papers in Sondurah, but they arrived six weeks old, and though they\nkept them abreast of what was going on in the world that interested them\nboth, they emphasised their exile. But these were fresh from the press.\nThey smelt different. They had a crispness that was almost voluptuous.\nHe wanted to read them all at once. Anne looked out of the window. The\ncountry was dark, and she could see little but the lights of their\ncarriage reflected on the glass, but very soon the town encroached upon\nit, and then she saw little sordid houses, mile upon mile of them, with\na light in a window here and there, and the chimneys made a dreary\npattern against the sky. They passed through Barking and East Ham and\nBromley--it was silly that the name on the platform as they went through\nthe station should give her such a tremor--and then Stepney. Alban put\ndown his papers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We shall be there in five minutes now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put on his hat and took down from the racks the things the porter had\nput in them. He looked at her with shining eyes and his lips twitched.\nShe saw that he was only just able to control his emotion. He looked out\nof the window, too, and they passed over brightly lighted thoroughfares,\nclose packed with tram-cars, buses and motor-vans, and they saw the\nstreets thick with people. What a mob! The shops were all lit up. They\nsaw the hawkers with their barrows at the kerb.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"London,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took her hand and gently pressed it. His smile was so sweet that she\nhad to say something. She tried to be facetious.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does it make you feel all funny inside?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know if I want to cry or if I want to be sick.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFenchurch Street. He lowered the window and waved his arm for a porter.\nWith a grinding of brakes the train came to a standstill. A porter\nopened the door and Alban handed him out one package after another. Then\nin his polite way, having jumped out, he gave his hand to Anne to help\nher down to the platform. The porter went to fetch a barrow and they\nstood by the pile of their luggage. Alban waved to two passengers from\nthe ship who passed them. The man nodded stiffly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a comfort it is that we shall never have to be civil to those\nawful people any more,\" said Alban lightly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnne gave him a quick glance. He was really incomprehensible. The porter\ncame back with his barrow, the luggage was put on and they followed him\nto collect their trunks. Alban took his wife's arm and pressed it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The smell of London. By God, it's grand.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe rejoiced in the noise and the bustle, and the crowd of people who\njostled them; the radiance of the arc-lamps and the black shadows they\ncast, sharp but full-toned, gave him a sense of elation. They got out\ninto the street and the porter went off to get them a taxi. Alban's eyes\nglittered as he looked at the buses and the policemen trying to direct\nthe confusion. His distinguished face bore a look of something like\ninspiration. The taxi came. Their luggage was stowed away and piled up\nbeside the driver, Alban gave the porter half-a-crown, and they drove\noff. They turned down Gracechurch Street and in Cannon Street were held\nup by a block in the traffic. Alban laughed out loud.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's the matter?\" said Anne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm so excited.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey went along the Embankment. It was relatively quiet there. Taxis and\ncars passed them. The bells of the trams were music in his ears. At\nWestminster Bridge they cut across Parliament Square and drove through\nthe green silence of St. James's Park. They had engaged a room at a\nhotel just off Jermyn Street. The reception clerk took them upstairs and\na porter brought up their luggage. It was a room with twin beds and a\nbathroom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This looks all right,\" said Alban. \"It'll do us till we can find a flat\nor something.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at his watch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, darling, we shall only fall over one another if we try to\nunpack together. We've got oodles of time and it'll take you longer to\nget straight and dress than me. I'll clear out. I want to go to the club\nand see if there's any mail for me. I've got my dinner jacket in my\nsuit-case and it'll only take me twenty minutes to have a bath and\ndress. Does that suit you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. That's all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll be back in an hour.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took out of his pocket the little comb he always carried and passed\nit through his long fair hair. Then he put on his hat. He gave himself a\nglance in the mirror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shall I turn on the bath for you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, don't bother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right. So long.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen he was gone Anne took her dressing-case and her hat-box and put\nthem on the top of her trunk. Then she rang the bell. She did not take\noff her hat. She sat down and lit a cigarette. When a servant answered\nthe bell she asked for the porter. He came. She pointed to the luggage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you take those things and leave them in the hall for the present.\nI'll tell you what to do with them presently.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very good, ma'am.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a florin. He took the trunk out and the other packages and\nclosed the door behind him. A few tears slid down Anne's cheeks, but she\nshook herself; she dried her eyes and powdered her face. She needed all\nher calm. She was glad that Alban had conceived the idea of going to his\nclub. It made things easier and gave her a little time to think them\nout.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow that the moment had come to do what she had for weeks determined,\nnow that she must say the terrible things she had to say, she quailed.\nHer heart sank. She knew exactly what she meant to say to Alban, she had\nmade up her mind about that long ago, and had said the very words to\nherself a hundred times, three or four times a day every day of the long\njourney from Singapore, but she was afraid that she would grow confused.\nShe dreaded an argument. The thought of a scene made her feel slightly\nsick. It was something at all events to have an hour in which to collect\nherself. He would say she was heartless and cruel and unreasonable. She\ncould not help it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, no, no,\" she cried aloud.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shuddered with horror. And all at once she saw herself again in the\nbungalow, sitting as she had been sitting when the whole thing started.\nIt was getting on towards tiffin time and in a few minutes Alban would\nbe back from the office. It gave her pleasure to reflect that it was an\nattractive room for him to come back to, the large verandah which was\ntheir parlour, and she knew that though they had been there eighteen\nmonths he was still alive to the success she had made of it. The\njalousies were drawn now against the midday sun and the mellowed light\nfiltering through them gave an impression of cool silence. Anne was\nhouse-proud, and though they were moved from district to district\naccording to the exigencies of the Service and seldom stayed anywhere\nvery long, at each new post she started with new enthusiasm to make\ntheir house cosy and charming. She was very modern. Visitors were\nsurprised because there were no knick-knacks. They were taken aback by\nthe bold colour of her curtains and could not at all make out the tinted\nreproductions of pictures by Marie Laurencin and Gauguin in silvered\nframes which were placed on the walls with such cunning skill. She was\nconscious that few of them quite approved and the good ladies of Port\nWallace and Pemberton thought such arrangements odd, affected and out of\nplace; but this left her calm. They would learn. It did them good to get\na bit of a jolt. And now she looked round the long, spacious verandah\nwith the complacent sigh of the artist satisfied with his work. It was\ngay. It was bare. It was restful. It refreshed the spirit and gently\nexcited the fancy. Three immense bowls of yellow cannas completed the\ncolour scheme. Her eyes lingered for a moment on the bookshelves filled\nwith books; that was another thing that disconcerted the colony, all the\nbooks they had, and strange books too, heavy they thought them for the\nmost part; and she gave them a little affectionate look as though they\nwere living things. Then she gave the piano a glance. A piece of music\nwas still open on the rack, it was something of Debussy, and Alban had\nbeen playing it before he went to the office.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer friends in the colony had condoled with her when Alban was appointed\nD.O. at Daktar, for it was the most isolated district in Sondurah. It\nwas connected with the town which was the headquarters of the Government\nneither by telegraph nor telephone. But she liked it. They had been\nthere for some time and she hoped they would remain till Alban went home\non leave in another twelve months. It was as large as an English county,\nwith a long coast-line, and the sea was dotted with little islands. A\nbroad, winding river ran through it and on each side of this stretched\nhills densely covered with virgin forest. The station, a good way up the\nriver, consisted of a row of Chinese shops and a native village nestling\namid coconut trees, the District Office, the D.O.'s bungalow, the\nclerk's quarters and the barracks. Their only neighbours were the\nmanager of a rubber estate a few miles up the river and the manager and\nhis assistant, Dutchmen both, of a timber camp on one of the river's\ntributaries. The rubber estate's launch went up and down twice a month\nand was their only means of regular communication with the outside\nworld. But though they were lonely they were not dull. Their days were\nfull. Their ponies waited for them at dawn and they rode while the day\nwas still fresh and in the bridle-paths through the jungle lingered the\nmystery of the tropical night. They came back, bathed, changed and had\nbreakfast, and Alban went to the office. Anne spent the morning writing\nletters and working. She had fallen in love with the country from the\nfirst day she arrived in it and had taken pains to master the common\nlanguage spoken. Her imagination was inflamed by the stories she heard\nof love and jealousy and death. She was told romantic tales of a time\nthat was only just past. She sought to steep herself in the lore of\nthose strange people. Both she and Alban read a great deal. They had for\nthe country a considerable library and new books came from London by\nnearly every mail. Little that was noteworthy escaped them. Alban was\nfond of playing the piano. For an amateur he played very well. He had\nstudied rather seriously, and he had an agreeable touch and a good ear;\nhe could read music with ease, and it was always a pleasure to Anne to\nsit by him and follow the score when he tried something new. But their\ngreat delight was to tour the district. Sometimes they would be away for\na fortnight at a time. They would go down the river in a prahu and then\nsail from one little island to another, bathe in the sea, and fish, or\nelse row up-stream till it grew shallow and the trees on either bank\nwere so close to one another that you only saw a slim strip of sky\nbetween. Here the boatmen had to pole and they would spend the night in\na native house. They bathed in a river pool so clear that you could see\nthe sand shining silver at the bottom; and the spot was so lovely, so\npeaceful and remote, that you felt you could stay there for ever.\nSometimes, on the other hand, they would tramp for days along the jungle\npaths, sleeping under canvas, and notwithstanding the mosquitoes that\ntormented them and the leeches that sucked their blood, enjoy every\nmoment. Whoever slept so well as on a camp-bed? And then there was the\ngladness of getting back, the delight in the comfort of the well-ordered\nestablishment, the mail that had arrived with letters from home and all\nthe papers, and the piano.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban would sit down to it then, his fingers itching to feel the keys,\nand in what he played, Stravinsky, Ravel, Darius Miehaud, she seemed to\nfeel that he put in something of his own, the sounds of the jungle at\nnight, dawn over the estuary, the starry nights and the crystal\nclearness of the forest pools.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSometimes the rain fell in sheets for days at a time. Then Alban worked\nat Chinese. He was learning it so that he could communicate with the\nChinese of the country in their own language, and Anne did the\nthousand-and-one things for which she had not had time before. Those\ndays brought them even more closely together; they always had plenty to\ntalk about, and when they were occupied with their separate affairs they\nwere pleased to feel in their bones that they were near to one another.\nThey were wonderfully united. The rainy days that shut them up within\nthe walls of the bungalow made them feel as if they were one body in\nface of the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn occasion they went to Port Wallace. It was a change, but Anne was\nalways glad to get home. She was never quite at her ease there. She was\nconscious that none of the people they met liked Alban. They were very\nordinary people, middle-class and suburban and dull, without any of the\nintellectual interests that made life so full and varied to Alban and\nher, and many of them were narrow-minded and ill-natured; but since they\nhad to pass the better part of their lives in contact with them, it was\ntiresome that they should feel so unkindly towards Alban. They said he\nwas conceited. He was always very pleasant with them, but she was aware\nthat they resented his cordiality. When he tried to be jovial they said\nhe was putting on airs, and when he chaffed them they thought he was\nbeing funny at their expense.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOnce they stayed at Government House, and Mrs. Hannay, the Governor's\nwife, who liked her, talked to her about it. Perhaps the Governor had\nsuggested that she should give Anne a hint.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, my dear, it's a pity your husband doesn't try to be more\ncome-hither with people. He's very intelligent; don't you think it would\nbe better if he didn't let others see he knows it quite so clearly? My\nhusband said to me only yesterday: Of course I know Alban Torel is the\ncleverest young man in the Service, but he does manage to put my back up\nmore than anyone I know. I am the Governor, but when he talks to me he\nalways gives me the impression that he looks upon me as a damned fool.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe worst of it was that Anne knew how low an opinion Alban had of the\nGovernor's parts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He doesn't mean to be superior,\" Anne answered, smiling. \"And he really\nisn't in the least conceited. I think it's only because he has a\nstraight nose and high cheek-bones.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, they don't like him at the club. They call him Powder-Puff\nPercy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnne flushed. She had heard that before and it made her very angry. Her\neyes filled with tears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think it's frightfully unfair.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hannay took her hand and gave it an affectionate little squeeze.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear, you know I don't want to hurt your feelings. Your husband\ncan't help rising very high in the Service. He'd make things so much\neasier for himself if he were a little more human. Why doesn't he play\nfootball?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not his game. He's always only too glad to play tennis.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He doesn't give that impression. He gives the impression that there's\nno one here who's worth his while to play with.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, there isn't,\" said Anne, stung.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban happened to be an extremely good tennis-player. He had played a\nlot of tournaments in England and Anne knew that it gave him a grim\nsatisfaction to knock those beefy, hearty men all over the court. He\ncould make the best of them look foolish. He could be maddening on the\ntennis court and Anne was aware that sometimes he could not resist the\ntemptation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He does play to the gallery, doesn't he?\" said Mrs. Hannay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think so. Believe me, Alban has no idea he isn't popular. As\nfar as I can see he's always pleasant and friendly with everybody.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's then he's most offensive,\" said Mrs. Hannay dryly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know people don't like us very much,\" said Anne, smiling a little.\n\"I'm very sorry, but really I don't know what we can do about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not you, my dear,\" cried Mrs. Hannay. \"Everybody adores you. That's why\nthey put up with your husband. My dear, who could help liking you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know why they should adore me,\" said Anne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut she did not say it quite sincerely. She was deliberately playing the\npart of the dear little woman and within her she bubbled with amusement.\nThey disliked Alban because he had such an air of distinction, and\nbecause he was interested in art and literature; they did not understand\nthese things and so thought them unmanly; and they disliked him because\nhis capacity was greater than theirs. They disliked him because he was\nbetter bred than they. They thought him superior; well, he was superior,\nbut not in the sense they meant. They forgave her because she was an\nugly little thing. That was what she called herself, but she wasn't\nthat, or if she was it was with an ugliness that was most attractive.\nShe was like a little monkey, but a very sweet little monkey and very\nhuman. She had a neat figure. That was her best point. That and her\neyes. They were very large, of a deep brown, liquid and shining; they\nwere full of fun, but they could be tender on occasion with a charming\nsympathy. She was dark, her frizzy hair was almost black, and her skin\nwas swarthy; she had a small fleshy nose, with large nostrils, and much\ntoo big a mouth. But she was alert and vivacious. She could talk with a\nshow of real interest to the ladies of the colony about their husbands\nand their servants and their children in England, and she could listen\nappreciatively to the men who told her stories that she had often heard\nbefore. They thought her a jolly good sort. They did not know what\nclever fun she made of them in private. It never occurred to them that\nshe thought them narrow, gross and pretentious. They found no glamour in\nthe East because they looked at it vulgarly with material eyes. Romance\nlingered at their threshold and they drove it away like an importunate\nbeggar. She was aloof. She repeated to herself Landor's line:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nature I loved, and next to nature, art.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe reflected on her conversation with Mrs. Hannay, but on the whole it\nleft her unconcerned. She wondered whether she should say anything about\nit to Alban; it had always seemed a little odd to her that he should be\nso little aware of his unpopularity; but she was afraid that if she told\nhim of it he would become self-conscious. He never noticed the coldness\nof the men at the club. He made them feel shy and therefore\nuncomfortable. His appearance then caused a sort of awkwardness, but he,\nhappily insensible, was breezily cordial to all and sundry. The fact was\nthat he was strangely unconscious of other people. She was in a class by\nherself, she and a little group of friends they had in London, but he\ncould never quite realise that the people of the colony, the government\nofficials and the planters and their wives, were human beings. They were\nto him like pawns in a game. He laughed with them, chaffed them, and was\namiably tolerant of them; with a chuckle Anne told herself that he was\nrather like the master of a preparatory school taking little boys out on\na picnic and anxious to give them a good time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was afraid it wasn't much good telling Alban. He was incapable of\nthe dissimulation which, she happily realised, came so easily to her.\nWhat was one to do with these people? The men had come out to the colony\nas lads from second-rate schools, and life had taught them nothing. At\nfifty they had the outlook of hobbledehoys. Most of them drank a great\ndeal too much. They read nothing worth reading. Their ambition was to be\nlike everybody else. Their highest praise was to say that a man was a\ndamned good sort. If you were interested in the things of the spirit you\nwere a prig. They were eaten up with envy of one another and devoured by\npetty jealousies. And the women, poor things, were obsessed by petty\nrivalries. They made a circle that was more provincial than any in the\nsmallest town in England. They were prudish and spiteful. What did it\nmatter if they did not like Alban? They would have to put up with him\nbecause his ability was so great. He was clever and energetic. They\ncould not say that he did not do his work well. He had been successful\nin every post he had occupied. With his sensitiveness and his\nimagination he understood the native mind and he was able to get the\nnatives to do things that no one in his position could. He had a gift\nfor languages, and he spoke all the local dialects. He not only knew the\ncommon tongue that most of the government officials spoke, but was\nacquainted with the niceties of the language and on occasion could make\nuse of a ceremonial speech that flattered and impressed the chiefs. He\nhad a gift for organisation. He was not afraid of responsibility. In due\ncourse he was bound to be made a Resident. Alban had some interest in\nEngland; his father was a brigadier-general killed in the war, and\nthough he had no private means he had influential friends. He spoke of\nthem with pleasant irony.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The great advantage of democratic government,\" he said, \"is that merit,\nwith influence to back it, can be pretty sure of receiving its due\nreward.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban was so obviously the ablest man in the Service that there seemed\nno reason why he should not eventually be made Governor. Then, thought\nAnne, his air of superiority, of which they complained, would be in\nplace. They would accept him as their master and he would know how to\nmake himself respected and obeyed. The position she foresaw did not\ndazzle her. She accepted it as a right. It would be fun for Alban to be\nGovernor and for her to be the Governor's wife. And what an opportunity!\nThey were sheep, the government servants and the planters; when\nGovernment House was the seat of culture they would soon fall into line.\nWhen the best way to the Governor's favour was to be intelligent,\nintelligence would become the fashion. She and Alban would cherish the\nnative arts and collect carefully the memorials of a vanished past. The\ncountry would make an advance it had never dreamed of. They would\ndevelop it, but along lines of order and beauty. They would instil into\ntheir subordinates a passion for that beautiful land and a loving\ninterest in these romantic races. They would make them realise what\nmusic meant. They would cultivate literature. They would create beauty.\nIt would be the golden age.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSuddenly she heard Alban's footstep. Anne awoke from her day-dream. All\nthat was far away in the future. Alban was only a District Officer yet\nand what was important was the life they were living now. She heard\nAlban go into the bath-house and splash water over himself. In a minute\nhe came in. He had changed into a shirt and shorts. His fair hair was\nstill wet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tiffin ready?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sat down at the piano and played the piece that he had played in the\nmorning. The silvery notes cascaded coolly down the sultry air. You had\nan impression of a formal garden with great trees and elegant pieces of\nartificial water and of leisurely walks bordered with pseudo-classical\nstatues. Alban played with a peculiar delicacy. Lunch was announced by\nthe head-boy. He rose from the piano. They walked into the dining-room\nhand in hand. A punkah lazily fanned the air. Anne gave the table a\nglance. With its bright-coloured tablecloth and the amusing plates it\nlooked very gay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Anything exciting at the office this morning?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, nothing much. A buffalo case. Oh, and Prynne has sent along to ask\nme to go up to the estate. Some coolies have been damaging the trees and\nhe wants me to come along and look into it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPrynne was manager of the rubber estate up the river and now and then\nthey spent a night with him. Sometimes when he wanted a change he came\ndown to dinner and slept at the D.O.'s bungalow. They both liked him. He\nwas a man of five-and-thirty, with a red face, with deep furrows in it,\nand very black hair. He was quite uneducated, but cheerful and easy, and\nbeing the only Englishman within two days' journey they could not but be\nfriendly with him. He had been a little shy of them at first. News\nspreads quickly in the East and long before they arrived in the district\nhe heard that they were highbrows. He did not know what he would make of\nthem. He probably did not know that he had charm, which makes up for\nmany more commendable qualities, and Alban with his almost feminine\nsensibilities was peculiarly susceptible to this. He found Alban much\nmore human than he expected, and of course Anne was stunning. Alban\nplayed ragtime for him, which he would not have done for the Governor,\nand played dominoes with him. When Alban was making his first tour of\nthe district with Anne, and suggested that they would like to spend a\ncouple of nights on the estate, he had thought it as well to warn him\nthat he lived with a native woman and had two children by her. He would\ndo his best to keep them out of Anne's sight, but he could not send them\naway, there was nowhere to send them. Alban laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Anne isn't that sort of woman at all. Don't dream of hiding them. She\nloves children.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnne quickly made friends with the shy, pretty little native woman and\nsoon was playing happily with the children. She and the girl had long\nconfidential chats. The children took a fancy to her. She brought them\nlovely toys from Port Wallace. Prynne, comparing her smiling tolerance\nwith the disapproving acidity of the other white women of the colony,\ndescribed himself as knocked all of a heap. He could not do enough to\nshow his delight and gratitude.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If all highbrows are like you,\" he said, \"give me highbrows every\ntime.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe hated to think that in another year they would leave the district for\ngood and the chances were that, if the next D.O. was married, his wife\nwould think it dreadful that, rather than live alone, he had a native\nwoman to live with him and, what was more, was much attached to her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut there had been a good deal of discontent on the estate of late. The\ncoolies were Chinese and infected with communist ideas. They were\ndisorderly. Alban had been obliged to sentence several of them for\nvarious crimes to terms of imprisonment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Prynne tells me that as soon as their term is up he's going to send\nthem all back to China and get Javanese instead,\" said Alban. \"I'm sure\nhe's right. They're much more amenable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't think there's going to be any serious trouble?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, no. Prynne knows his job and he's a pretty determined fellow. He\nwouldn't put up with any nonsense and with me and our policemen to back\nhim up I don't imagine they'll try any monkey tricks.\" He smiled. \"The\niron hand in the velvet glove.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe words were barely out of his mouth when a sudden shouting arose.\nThere was a commotion and the sound of steps. Loud voices and cries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tuan, Tuan.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the devil's the matter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban sprang from his chair and went swiftly on to the verandah. Anne\nfollowed him. At the bottom of the steps was a group of natives. There\nwas the sergeant, and three or four policemen, boatmen and several men\nfrom the kampong.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it?\" called Alban.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTwo or three shouted back in answer. The sergeant pushed others aside\nand Alban saw lying on the ground a man in a shirt and khaki shorts. He\nran down the steps. He recognised the man as the assistant manager of\nPrynne's estate. He was a half-caste. His shorts were covered with blood\nand there was clotted blood all over one side of his face and head. He\nwas unconscious.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bring him up here,\" called Anne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban gave an order. The man was lifted up and carried on to the\nverandah. They laid him on the floor and Anne put a pillow under his\nhead. She sent for water and for the medicine-chest in which they kept\nthings for emergency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is he dead?\" asked Alban.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Better try to give him some brandy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe boatmen brought ghastly news. The Chinese coolies had risen suddenly\nand attacked the manager's office. Prynne was killed and the assistant\nmanager, Oakley by name, had escaped only by the skin of his teeth. He\nhad come upon the rioters when they were looting the office, he had seen\nPrynne's body thrown out of the window, and had taken to his heels. Some\nof the Chinese saw him and gave chase. He ran for the river and was\nwounded as he jumped into the launch. The launch managed to put off\nbefore the Chinese could get on board and they had come down-stream for\nhelp as fast as they could go. As they went they saw flames rising from\nthe office buildings. There was no doubt that the coolies had burned\ndown everything that would burn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOakley gave a groan and opened his eyes. He was a little, dark-skinned\nman, with flattened features and thick coarse hair. His great native\neyes were filled with terror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're all right,\" said Anne. \"You're quite safe.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave a sigh and smiled. Anne washed his face and swabbed it with\nantiseptics. The wound on his head was not serious.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can you speak yet?\" said Alban.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wait a bit,\" she said. \"We must look at his leg.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban ordered the sergeant to get the crowd out of the verandah. Anne\nripped up one leg of the shorts. The material was clinging to the\ncoagulated wound.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've been bleeding like a pig,\" said Oakley.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was only a flesh wound. Alban was clever with his fingers, and though\nthe blood began to flow again they stanched it. Alban put on a dressing\nand a bandage. The sergeant and a policeman lifted Oakley on to a long\nchair. Alban gave him a brandy and soda, and soon he felt strong enough\nto speak. He knew no more than the boatmen had already told. Prynne was\ndead and the estate was in flames.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And the girl and the children?\" asked Anne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Alban.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must turn out the police. Are you sure Prynne is dead?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, sir. I saw him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have the rioters got fire-arms?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How d'you mean, you don't know?\" Alban cried irritably. \"Prynne had a\ngun, hadn't he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There must have been more on the estate. You had one, didn't you? The\nhead overseer had one.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe half-caste was silent. Alban looked at him sternly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How many of those damned Chinese are there?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A hundred and fifty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnne wondered that he asked so many questions. It seemed waste of time.\nThe important thing was to collect coolies for the transport up-river,\nprepare the boats and issue ammunition to the police.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How many policemen have you got, sir?\" asked Oakley.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Eight and the sergeant.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Could I come too? That would make ten of us. I'm sure I shall be all\nright now I'm bandaged.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not going,\" said Alban.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Alban, you must,\" cried Anne. She could not believe her ears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nonsense. It would be madness. Oakley's obviously useless. He's sure to\nhave a temperature in a few hours. He'd only be in the way. That leaves\nnine guns. There are a hundred and fifty Chinese and they've got\nfire-arms and all the ammunition in the world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How d'you know?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It stands to reason they wouldn't have started a show like this unless\nthey had. It would be idiotic to go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnne stared at him with open mouth. Oakley's eyes were puzzled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, fortunately we've got the launch. I'll send it to Port Wallace\nwith a request for reinforcements.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But they won't be here for two days at least.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what of it? Prynne's dead and the estate burned to the ground. We\ncouldn't do any good by going up now. I shall send a native to\nreconnoitre so that we can find out exactly what the rioters are doing.\"\nHe gave Anne his charming smile. \"Believe me, my pet, the rascals won't\nlose anything by waiting a day or two for what's coming to them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOakley opened his mouth to speak, but perhaps he hadn't the nerve. He\nwas a half-caste assistant manager and Alban, the D.O., represented the\npower of the Government. But the man's eyes sought Anne's and she\nthought she read in them an earnest and personal appeal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But in two days they're capable of committing the most frightful\natrocities,\" she cried. \"It's quite unspeakable what they may do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Whatever damage they do they'll pay for. I promise you that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Alban, you can't sit still and do nothing. I beseech you to go\nyourself at once.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be so silly. I can't quell a riot with eight policemen and a\nsergeant. I haven't got the right to take a risk of that sort. We'd have\nto go in boats. You don't think we could get up unobserved. The lalang\nalong the banks is perfect cover and they could just take pot shots at\nus as we came along. We shouldn't have a chance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid they'll only think it weakness if nothing is done for two\ndays, sir,\" said Oakley.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When I want your opinion I'll ask for it,\" said Alban acidly. \"So far\nas I can see when there was danger the only thing you did was to cut and\nrun. I can't persuade myself that your assistance in a crisis would be\nvery valuable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe half-caste reddened. He said nothing more. He looked straight in\nfront of him with troubled eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going down to the office,\" said Alban. \"I'll just write a short\nreport and send it down the river by launch at once.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave an order to the sergeant, who had been standing all this time\nstiffly at the top of the steps. He saluted and ran off. Alban went into\na little hall they had to get his topee. Anne swiftly followed him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Alban, for God's sake listen to me a minute,\" she whispered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want to be rude to you, darling, but I am pressed for time. I\nthink you'd much better mind your own business.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't do nothing, Alban. You must go. Whatever the risk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be such a fool,\" he said angrily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had never been angry with her before. She seized his hand to hold him\nback.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I tell you I can do no good by going.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't know. There's the woman and Prynne's children. We must do\nsomething to save them. Let me come with you. They'll kill them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They've probably killed them already.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, how can you be so callous! If there's a chance of saving them it's\nyour duty to try.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's my duty to act like a reasonable human being. I'm not going to\nrisk my life and my policemen's for the sake of a native woman and her\nhalf-caste brats. What sort of a damned fool do you take me for?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They'll say you were afraid.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Everyone in the colony.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe smiled disdainfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you only knew what a complete contempt I have for the opinion of\neveryone in the colony.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a long searching look. She had been married to him for\neight years and she knew every expression of his face and every thought\nin his mind. She stared into his blue eyes as if they were open windows.\nShe suddenly went quite pale. She dropped his hand and turned away.\nWithout another word she went back on to the verandah. Her ugly little\nmonkey face was a mask of horror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban went to his office, wrote a brief account of the facts, and in a\nfew minutes the motor launch was pounding down the river.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe next two days were endless. Escaped natives brought them news of\nhappenings on the estate. But from their excited and terrified stories\nit was impossible to get an exact impression of the truth. There had\nbeen a good deal of bloodshed. The head overseer had been killed. They\nbrought wild tales of cruelty and outrage. Anne could hear nothing of\nPrynne's woman and the two children. She shuddered when she thought of\nwhat might have been their fate. Alban collected as many natives as he\ncould. They were armed with spears and swords. He commandeered boats.\nThe situation was serious, but he kept his head. He felt that he had\ndone all that was possible and nothing remained but for him to carry on\nnormally. He did his official work. He played the piano a great deal. He\nrode with Anne in the early morning. He appeared to have forgotten that\nthey had had the first serious difference of opinion in the whole of\ntheir married life. He took it that Anne had accepted the wisdom of his\ndecision. He was as amusing, cordial and gay with her as he had always\nbeen. When he spoke of the rioters it was with grim irony: when the time\ncame to settle matters a good many of them would wish they had never\nbeen born.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What'll happen to them?\" asked Anne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, they'll hang.\" He gave a shrug of distaste. \"I hate having to be\npresent at executions. It always makes me feel rather sick.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was very sympathetic to Oakley, whom they had put to bed and whom\nAnne was nursing. Perhaps he was sorry that in the exasperation of the\nmoment he had spoken to him offensively, and he went out of his way to\nbe nice to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen on the afternoon of the third day, when they were drinking their\ncoffee after luncheon, Alban's quick ears caught the sound of a motor\nboat approaching. At the same moment a policeman ran up to say that the\ngovernment launch was sighted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At last,\" cried Alban.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe bolted out of the house. Anne raised one of the jalousies and looked\nout at the river. Now the sound was quite loud and in a moment she saw\nthe boat come round the bend. She saw Alban on the landing-stage. He got\ninto a prahu and as the launch dropped her anchor he went on board. She\ntold Oakley that the reinforcements had come.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will the D.O. go up with them when they attack?\" he asked her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Naturally,\" said Anne coldly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wondered.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnne felt a strange feeling in her heart. For the last two days she had\nhad to exercise all her self-control not to cry. She did not answer. She\nwent out of the room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA quarter of an hour later Alban returned to the bungalow with the\ncaptain of constabulary who had been sent with twenty Sikhs to deal with\nthe rioters. Captain Stratton was a little red-faced man with a red\nmoustache and bow legs, very hearty and dashing, whom she had met often\nat Port Wallace.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Mrs. Torel, this is a pretty kettle of fish,\" he cried, as he\nshook hands with her, in a loud jolly voice. \"Here I am, with my army\nall full of pep and ready for a scrap. Up, boys, and at 'em. Have you\ngot anything to drink in this benighted place?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Boy,\" she cried, smiling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Something long and cool and faintly alcoholic, and then I'm ready to\ndiscuss the plan of campaign.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis breeziness was very comforting. It blew away the sullen apprehension\nthat had seemed ever since the disaster to brood over the lost peace of\nthe bungalow. The boy came in with a tray and Stratton mixed himself a\nstengah. Alban put him in possession of the facts. He told them clearly,\nbriefly and with precision.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must say I admire you,\" said Stratton. \"In your place I should never\nhave been able to resist the temptation to take my eight cops and have a\nwhack at the blighters myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought it was a perfectly unjustifiable risk to take.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Safety first, old boy, eh, what?\" said Stratton jovially. \"I'm jolly\nglad you didn't. It's not often we get the chance of a scrap. It would\nhave been a dirty trick to keep the whole show to yourself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCaptain Stratton was all for steaming straight up the river and\nattacking at once, but Alban pointed out to him the inadvisability of\nsuch a course. The sound of the approaching launch would warn the\nrioters. The long grass at the river's edge offered them cover and they\nhad enough guns to make a landing difficult. It seemed useless to expose\nthe attacking force to their fire. It was silly to forget that they had\nto face a hundred and fifty desperate men and it would be easy to fall\ninto an ambush. Alban expounded his own plan. Stratton listened to it.\nHe nodded now and then. The plan was evidently a good one. It would\nenable them to take the rioters on the rear, surprise them, and in all\nprobability finish the job without a single casualty. He would have been\na fool not to accept it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But why didn't you do that yourself?\" asked Stratton.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"With eight men and a sergeant?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nStratton did not answer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Anyhow it's not a bad idea and we'll settle on it. It gives us plenty\nof time, so with your permission, Mrs. Torel, I'll have a bath.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey set out at sunset, Captain Stratton and his twenty Sikhs, Alban\nwith his policemen and the natives he had collected. The night was dark\nand moonless. Trailing behind them were the dug-outs that Alban had\ngathered together and into which after a certain distance they proposed\nto transfer their force. It was important that no sound should give\nwarning of their approach. After they had gone for about three hours by\nlaunch they took to the dug-outs and in them silently paddled up-stream.\nThey reached the border of the vast estate and landed. Guides led them\nalong a path so narrow that they had to march in single file. It had\nbeen long unused and the going was heavy. They had twice to ford a\nstream. The path led them circuitously to the rear of the coolie lines,\nbut they did not wish to reach them till nearly dawn and presently\nStratton gave the order to halt. It was a long cold wait. At last the\nnight seemed to be less dark; you did not see the trunks of the trees,\nbut were vaguely sensible of them against its darkness. Stratton had\nbeen sitting with his back to a tree. He gave a whispered order to a\nsergeant and in a few minutes the column was once more on the march.\nSuddenly they found themselves on a road. They formed fours. The dawn\nbroke and in the ghostly light the surrounding objects were wanly\nvisible. The column stopped on a whispered order. They had come in sight\nof the coolie lines. Silence reigned in them. The column crept on again\nand again halted. Stratton, his eyes shining, gave Alban a smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We've caught the blighters asleep.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe lined up his men. They inserted cartridges in their guns. He stepped\nforward and raised his hand. The carbines were pointed at the coolie\nlines.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fire.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a rattle as the volley of shots rang out. Then suddenly there\nwas a tremendous din and the Chinese poured out, shouting and waving\ntheir arms, but in front of them, to Alban's utter bewilderment,\nbellowing at the top of his voice and shaking his fist at them, was a\nwhite man.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who the hell's that?\" cried Stratton.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA very big, very fat man, in khaki trousers and a singlet, was running\ntowards them as fast as his fat legs would carry him and as he ran\nshaking both fists at them and yelling:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Smerige flikkers! Verlockte ploerten!</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My God, it's Van Hasseldt,\" said Alban.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis was the Dutch manager of the timber camp which was situated on a\nconsiderable tributary of the river about twenty miles away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing?\" he puffed as he came up to\nthem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How the hell did you get here?\" asked Stratton in turn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe saw that the Chinese were scattering in all directions and gave his\nmen instructions to round them up. Then he turned again to Van Hasseldt.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's it mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mean? Mean?\" shouted the Dutchman furiously. \"That's what I want to\nknow. You and your damned policemen. What do you mean by coming here at\nthis hour in the morning and firing a damned volley. Target practice?\nYou might have killed me. Idiots!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have a cigarette,\" said Stratton.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did you get here, Van Hasseldt?\" asked Alban again, very much at\nsea. \"This is the force they've sent from Port Wallace to quell the\nriot.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How did I get here? I walked. How did you think I got here? Riot be\ndamned. I quelled the riot. If that's what you came for you can take\nyour damned policemen home again. A bullet came within a foot of my\nhead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't understand,\" said Alban.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's nothing to understand,\" spluttered Van Hasseldt, still fuming.\n\"Some coolies came to my estate and said the Chinks had killed Prynne\nand burned the bally place down, so I took my assistant and my head\noverseer and a Dutch friend I had staying with me and came over to see\nwhat the trouble was.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCaptain Stratton opened his eyes wide.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you just stroll in as if it was a picnic?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you don't think after all the years I've been in this country I'm\ngoing to let a couple of hundred Chinks put the fear of God into me? I\nfound them all scared out of their lives. One of them had the nerve to\npull a gun on me and I blew his bloody brains out. And the rest\nsurrendered. I've got the leaders tied up. I was going to send a boat\ndown to you this morning to come up and get them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nStratton stared at him for a minute and then burst into a shout of\nlaughter. He laughed till the tears ran down his face. The Dutchman\nlooked at him angrily, then began to laugh too; he laughed with the big\nbelly laugh of a very fat man and his coils of fat heaved and shook.\nAlban watched them sullenly. He was very angry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What about Prynne's girl and the kids?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, they got away all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt just showed how wise he had been not to let himself be influenced by\nAnne's hysteria. Of course the children had come to no harm. He never\nthought they would.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nVan Hasseldt and his little party started back for the timber camp, and\nas soon after as possible Stratton embarked his twenty Sikhs and leaving\nAlban with his sergeant and his policemen to deal with the situation\ndeparted for Port Wallace. Alban gave him a brief report for the\nGovernor. There was much for him to do. It looked as though he would\nhave to stay for a considerable time; but since every house on the\nestate had been burned to the ground and he was obliged to instal\nhimself in the coolie lines he thought it better that Anne should not\njoin him. He sent her a note to that effect. He was glad to be able to\nreassure her of the safety of poor Prynne's girl. He set to work at once\nto make his preliminary enquiry. He examined a host of witnesses. But a\nweek later he received an order to go to Port Wallace at once. The\nlaunch that brought it was to take him and he was able to see Anne on\nthe way down for no more than an hour. Alban was a trifle vexed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know why the Governor can't leave me to get things straight\nwithout dragging me off like this. It's extremely inconvenient.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, well, the Government never bothers very much about the convenience\nof its subordinates, does it?\" smiled Anne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's just red-tape. I would offer to take you along, darling, only I\nshan't stay a minute longer than I need. I want to get my evidence\ntogether for the Sessions Court as soon as possible. I think in a\ncountry like this it's very important that justice should be prompt.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen the launch came in to Port Wallace one of the harbour police told\nhim that the harbour-master had a chit for him. It was from the\nGovernor's secretary and informed him that His Excellency desired to see\nhim as soon as convenient after his arrival. It was ten in the morning.\nAlban went to the club, had a bath and shaved, and then in clean ducks,\nhis hair neatly brushed, he called a rickshaw and told the boy to take\nhim to the Governor's office. He was at once shown in to the secretary's\nroom. The secretary shook hands with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll tell H.E. you're here,\" he said. \"Won't you sit down?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe secretary left the room and in a little while came back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"H.E. will see you in a minute. Do you mind if I get on with my\nletters?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban smiled. The secretary was not exactly come-hither. He waited,\nsmoking a cigarette, and amused himself with his own thoughts. He was\nmaking a good job of the preliminary enquiry. It interested him. Then an\norderly came in and told Alban that the Governor was ready for him. He\nrose from his seat and followed him into the Governor's room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-morning, Torel.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-morning, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Governor was sitting at a large desk. He nodded to Alban and\nmotioned to him to take a seat. The Governor was all grey. His hair was\ngrey, his face, his eyes; he looked as though the tropical suns had\nwashed the colour out of him; he had been in the country for thirty\nyears and had risen one by one through all the ranks of the Service; he\nlooked tired and depressed. Even his voice was grey. Alban liked him\nbecause he was quiet; he did not think him clever, but he had an\nunrivalled knowledge of the country, and his great experience was a very\ngood substitute for intelligence. He looked at Alban for a full moment\nwithout speaking and the odd idea came to Alban that he was embarrassed.\nHe very nearly gave him a lead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I saw Van Hasseldt yesterday,\" said the Governor suddenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you give me your account of the occurrences at the Alud Estate and\nof the steps you took to deal with them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban had an orderly mind. He was self-possessed. He marshalled his\nfacts well and was able to state them with precision. He chose his words\nwith care and spoke them fluently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You had a sergeant and eight policemen. Why did you not immediately go\nto the scene of the disturbance?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought the risk was unjustifiable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA thin smile was outlined on the Governor's grey face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If the officers of this Government had hesitated to take unjustifiable\nrisks it would never have become a province of the British Empire.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban was silent. It was difficult to talk to a man who spoke obvious\nnonsense.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am anxious to hear your reasons for the decision you took.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban gave them coolly. He was quite convinced of the rightness of his\naction. He repeated, but more fully, what he had said in the first place\nto Anne. The Governor listened attentively.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Van Hasseldt, with his manager, a Dutch friend of his, and a native\noverseer, seems to have coped with the situation very efficiently,\" said\nthe Governor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He had a lucky break. That doesn't prevent him from being a damned\nfool. It was madness to do what he did.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you realise that by leaving a Dutch planter to do what you should\nhave done yourself, you have covered the Government with ridicule?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've made yourself a laughing-stock in the whole colony.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My back is broad enough to bear the ridicule of persons to whose\nopinion I am entirely indifferent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The utility of a government official depends very largely on his\nprestige, and I'm afraid his prestige is likely to be inconsiderable\nwhen he lies under the stigma of cowardice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban flushed a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't quite know what you mean by that, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've gone into the matter very carefully. I've seen Captain Stratton,\nand Oakley, poor Prynne's assistant, and I've seen Van Hasseldt. I've\nlistened to your defence.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know that I was defending myself, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Be so good as not to interrupt me. I think you committed a grave error\nof judgment. As it turns out, the risk was very small, but whatever it\nwas, I think you should have taken it. In such matters promptness and\nfirmness are essential. It is not for me to conjecture what motive led\nyou to send for a force of constabulary and do nothing till they came. I\nam afraid, however, that I consider that your usefulness in the Service\nis no longer very great.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban looked at him with astonishment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But would you have gone under the circumstances?\" he asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban shrugged his shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you believe me?\" rapped out the Governor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I believe you, sir. But perhaps you will allow me to say that\nif you had been killed the colony would have suffered an irreparable\nloss.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Governor drummed on the table with his fingers. He looked out of the\nwindow and then looked again at Alban. When he spoke it was not\nunkindly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think you are unfitted by temperament for this rather\nrough-and-tumble life, Torel. If you'll take my advice you'll go home.\nWith your abilities I feel sure that you'll soon find an occupation much\nbetter suited to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, come, Torel, you're not stupid. I'm trying to make things easy for\nyou. For your wife's sake as well as for your own I do not wish you to\nleave the colony with the stigma of being dismissed from the Service for\ncowardice. I'm giving you the opportunity of resigning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you very much, sir. I'm not prepared to avail myself of the\nopportunity. If I resign I admit that I committed an error and that the\ncharge you make against me is justified. I don't admit it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can please yourself. I have considered the matter very carefully\nand I have no doubt about it in my mind. I am forced to discharge you\nfrom the Service. The necessary papers will reach you in due course.\nMeanwhile you will return to your post and hand over to the officer\nappointed to succeed you on his arrival.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very good, sir,\" replied Alban, a twinkle of amusement in his eyes.\n\"When do you desire me to return to my post?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At once.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you any objection to my going to the club and having tiffin before\nI go?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Governor looked at him with surprise. His exasperation was mingled\nwith an unwilling admiration.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not at all. I'm sorry, Torel, that this unhappy incident should have\ndeprived the Government of a servant whose zeal has always been so\napparent and whose tact, intelligence and industry seemed to point him\nout in the future for very high office.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your Excellency does not read Schiller, I suppose. You are probably not\nacquainted with his celebrated line: <i>mit der Dummheit kämpfen die\nGötter selbst vergebens</i>.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does it mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Roughly: Against stupidity the gods themselves battle in vain.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith his head in the air, a smile on his lips, Alban left the Governor's\noffice. The Governor was human, and he had the curiosity to ask his\nsecretary later in the day if Alban Torel had really gone to the club.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, sir. He had tiffin there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must have wanted some nerve.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban entered the club jauntily and joined the group of men standing at\nthe bar. He talked to them in the breezy, cordial tone he always used\nwith them. It was designed to put them at their ease. They had been\ndiscussing him ever since Stratton had come back to Port Wallace with\nhis story, sneering at him and laughing at him, and all who had resented\nhis superciliousness, and they were the majority, were triumphant\nbecause his pride had had a fall. But they were so taken aback at seeing\nhim now, so confused to find him as confident as ever, that it was they\nwho were embarrassed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne man, though he knew perfectly, asked him what he was doing in Port\nWallace.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I came about the riot on the Alud Estate. H.E. wanted to see me. He\ndoes not see eye to eye with me about it. The silly old ass has fired\nme. I'm going home as soon as he appoints a D.O. to take over.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a moment of awkwardness. One, more kindly disposed than the\nothers, said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm awfully sorry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlban shrugged his shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear fellow, what can you do with a perfect damned fool? The only\nthing is to let him stew in his own juice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen the Governor's secretary had told his chief as much of this as he\nthought discreet, the Governor smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Courage is a queer thing. I would rather have shot myself than go to\nthe club just then and face all those fellows.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA fortnight later, having sold to the incoming D.O. all the decorations\nthat Anne had taken so much trouble about, with the rest of their things\nin packing-cases and trunks, they arrived at Port Wallace to await the\nlocal steamer that was to take them to Singapore. The padre's wife\ninvited them to stay with her, but Anne refused; she insisted that they\nshould go to the hotel. An hour after their arrival she received a very\nkind little letter from the Governor's wife asking her to go and have\ntea with her. She went. She found Mrs. Hannay alone, but in a minute the\nGovernor joined them. He expressed his regret that she was leaving and\ntold her how sorry he was for the cause.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's very kind of you to say that,\" said Anne, smiling gaily, \"but you\nmustn't think I take it to heart. I'm entirely on Alban's side. I think\nwhat he did was absolutely right and if you don't mind my saying so I\nthink you've treated him most unjustly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Believe me, I hated having to take the step I took.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't let's talk about it,\" said Anne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are your plans when you get home?\" asked Mrs. Hannay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnne began to chat brightly. You would have thought she had not a care\nin the world. She seemed in great spirits at going home. She was jolly\nand amusing and made little jokes. When she took leave of the Governor\nand his wife she thanked them for all their kindness. The Governor\nescorted her to the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe next day but one, after dinner, they went on board the clean and\ncomfortable little ship. The padre and his wife saw them off. When they\nwent into their cabin they found a large parcel on Anne's bunk. It was\naddressed to Alban. He opened it and saw that it was an immense\npowder-puff.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hullo, I wonder who sent us this,\" he said, with a laugh. \"It must be\nfor you, darling.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnne gave him a quick look. She went pale. The brutes! How could they be\nso cruel? She forced herself to smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's enormous, isn't it? I've never seen such a large powder-puff in my\nlife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut when he had left the cabin and they were out at sea, she threw it\npassionately overboard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd now, now that they were back in London and Sondurah was nine\nthousand miles away, she clenched her hands as she thought of it.\nSomehow, it seemed the worst thing of all. It was so wantonly unkind to\nsend that absurd object to Alban, Powder-Puff Percy; it showed such a\npetty spite. Was that their idea of humour? Nothing had hurt her more\nand even now she felt that it was only by holding on to herself that she\ncould prevent herself from crying. Suddenly she started, for the door\nopened and Alban came in. She was still sitting in the chair in which he\nhad left her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hullo, why haven't you dressed?\" He looked about the room. \"You haven't\nunpacked.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why on earth not?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not going to unpack. I'm not going to stay here. I'm leaving you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've stuck it out till now. I made up my mind I would till we got home.\nI set my teeth, I've borne more than I thought it possible to bear, but\nnow it's finished. I've done all that could be expected of me. We're\nback in London now and I can go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at her in utter bewilderment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you mad, Anne?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my God, what I've endured! The journey to Singapore, with all the\nofficers knowing, and even the Chinese stewards. And at Singapore, the\nway people looked at us at the hotel, and the sympathy I had to put up\nwith, the bricks they dropped and their embarrassment when they realised\nwhat they'd done. My God, I could have killed them. That interminable\njourney home. There wasn't a single passenger on the ship who didn't\nknow. The contempt they had for you and the kindness they went out of\ntheir way to show me. And you so self-complacent and so pleased with\nyourself, seeing nothing, feeling nothing. You must have the hide of a\nrhinoceros. The misery of seeing you so chatty and agreeable. Pariahs,\nthat's what we were. You seemed to ask them to snub you. How can anyone\nbe so shameless?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was flaming with passion. Now that at last she need not wear the\nmask of indifference and pride that she had forced herself to assume she\ncast aside all reserve and all self-control. The words poured from her\ntrembling lips in a virulent stream.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear, how can you be so absurd?\" he said good-naturedly, smiling.\n\"You must be very nervous and high-strung to have got such ideas in your\nhead. Why didn't you tell me? You're like a country bumpkin who comes to\nLondon and thinks everyone is staring at him. Nobody bothered about us,\nand if they did what on earth did it matter? You ought to have more\nsense than to bother about what a lot of fools say. And what do you\nimagine they were saying?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They were saying you'd been fired.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, that was true,\" he laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They said you were a coward.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What of it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you see, that was true too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at her for a moment reflectively. His lips tightened a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what makes you think so?\" he asked acidly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I saw it in your eyes, that day the news came, when you refused to go\nto the estate and I followed you into the hall when you went to fetch\nyour topee. I begged you to go, I felt that whatever the danger you must\ntake it, and suddenly I saw the fear in your eyes. I nearly fainted with\nthe horror.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have been a fool to risk my life to no purpose. Why should I?\nNothing that concerned me was at stake. Courage is the obvious virtue of\nthe stupid. I don't attach any particular importance to it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How do you mean that nothing that concerned you was at stake? If that's\ntrue then your whole life is a sham. You've given away everything you\nstood for, everything we both stand for. You've let all of us down. We\ndid set ourselves up on a pinnacle, we did think ourselves better than\nthe rest of them because we loved literature and art and music, we\nweren't content to live a life of ignoble jealousies and vulgar\ntittle-tattle, we did cherish the things of the spirit, and we loved\nbeauty. It was our food and drink. They laughed at us and sneered at us.\nThat was inevitable. The ignorant and the common naturally hate and fear\nthose who are interested in things they don't understand. We didn't\ncare. We called them Philistines. We despised them and we had a right to\ndespise them. Our justification was that we were better and nobler and\nwiser and braver than they were. And you weren't better, you weren't\nnobler, you weren't braver. When the crisis came you slunk away like a\nwhipped cur with his tail between his legs. You of all people hadn't the\nright to be a coward. They despise us now and they have the right to\ndespise us. Us and all we stood for. Now they can say that art and\nbeauty are all rot; when it comes to a pinch people like us always let\nyou down. They never stopped looking for a chance to turn and rend us\nand you gave it to them. They can say that they always expected it. It's\na triumph for them. I used to be furious because they called you\nPowder-Puff Percy. Did you know they did?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course. I thought it very vulgar, but it left me entirely\nindifferent.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's funny that their instinct should have been so right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean to say you've been harbouring this against me all these\nweeks? I should never have thought you capable of it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I couldn't let you down when everyone was against you. I was too proud\nfor that. Whatever happened I swore to myself that I'd stick to you till\nwe got home. It's been torture.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you love me any more?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Love you? I loathe the very sight of you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Anne!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"God knows I loved you. For eight years I worshipped the ground you trod\non. You were everything to me. I believed in you as some people believe\nin God. When I saw the fear in your eyes that day, when you told me that\nyou weren't going to risk your life for a kept woman and her half-caste\nbrats, I was shattered. It was as though someone had wrenched my heart\nout of my body and trampled on it. You killed my love there and then,\nAlban. You killed it stone-dead. Since then when you've kissed me I've\nhad to clench my hands so as not to turn my face away. The mere thought\nof anything else makes me feel physically sick. I loathe your\ncomplacence and your frightful insensitiveness. Perhaps I could have\nforgiven it if it had been just a moment's weakness and if afterwards\nyou'd been ashamed. I should have been miserable, but I think my love\nwas so great that I should only have felt pity for you. But you're\nincapable of shame. And now I believe in nothing. You're only a silly,\npretentious vulgar poseur. I would rather be the wife of a second-rate\nplanter so long as he had the common human virtues of a man than the\nwife of a fake like you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not answer. Gradually his face began to discompose. Those\nhandsome, regular features of his horribly distorted and suddenly he\nbroke out into loud sobs. She gave a little cry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't, Alban, don't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, darling, how can you be so cruel to me? I adore you. I'd give my\nwhole life to please you. I can't live without you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe put out her arms as though to ward off a blow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, no, Alban, don't try to move me. I can't. I must go. I can't live\nwith you any more. It would be frightful. I can never forget. I must\ntell you the truth, I have only contempt for you and repulsion.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sank down at her feet and tried to cling to her knees. With a gasp\nshe sprang up and he buried his head in the empty chair. He cried\npainfully with sobs that tore his chest. The sound was horrible. The\ntears streamed from Anne's eyes and, putting her hands to her ears to\nshut out that dreadful, hysterical sobbing, blindly stumbling she rushed\nto the door and ran out.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nSome people read for instruction, which is praiseworthy, and some for\npleasure, which is innocent, but not a few read from habit, and I\nsuppose that this is neither innocent nor praiseworthy. Of that\nlamentable company am I. Conversation after a time bores me, games tire\nme, and my own thoughts, which we are told are the unfailing resource of\na sensible man, have a tendency to run dry. Then I fly to my book as the\nopium-smoker to his pipe. I would sooner read the catalogue of the Army\nand Navy Stores or Bradshaw's Guide than nothing at all, and indeed I\nhave spent many delightful hours over both these works. At one time I\nnever went out without a second-hand bookseller's list in my pocket. I\nknow no reading more fruity. Of course to read in this way is as\nreprehensible as doping, and I never cease to wonder at the impertinence\nof great readers who, because they are such, look down on the\nilliterate. From the standpoint of what eternity is it better to have\nread a thousand books than to have ploughed a million furrows? Let us\nadmit that reading with us is just a drug that we cannot do without--who\nof this band does not know the restlessness that attacks him when he has\nbeen severed from reading too long, the apprehension and irritability,\nand the sigh of relief which the sight of a printed page extracts from\nhim?--and so let us be no more vainglorious than the poor slaves of the\nhypodermic needle or the pint-pot.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd like the dope-fiend who cannot move from place to place without\ntaking with him a plentiful supply of his deadly balm I never venture\nfar without a sufficiency of reading matter. Books are so necessary to\nme that when in a railway train I have become aware that\nfellow-travellers have come away without a single one I have been seized\nwith a veritable dismay. But when I am starting on a long journey the\nproblem is formidable. I have learnt my lesson. Once, imprisoned by\nillness for three months in a hill-town in Java, I came to the end of\nall the books I had brought with me, and knowing no Dutch was obliged to\nbuy the school-books from which intelligent Javanese, I suppose,\nacquired knowledge of French and German. So I read again after\nfive-and-twenty years the frigid plays of Goethe, the fables of La\nFontaine and the tragedies of the tender and exact Racine. I have the\ngreatest admiration for Racine, but I admit that to read his plays one\nafter the other requires a certain effort in a person who is suffering\nfrom colitis. Since then I have made a point of travelling with the\nlargest sack made for carrying soiled linen and filling it to the brim\nwith books to suit every possible occasion and every mood. It weighs a\nton and strong porters reel under its weight. Custom-house officials\nlook at it askance, but recoil from it with consternation when I give\nthem my word that it contains nothing but books. Its inconvenience is\nthat the particular work I suddenly hanker to read is always at the\nbottom and it is impossible for me to get it without emptying the\nbook-bag's entire contents upon the floor. Except for this, however, I\nshould perhaps never have heard the singular history of Olive Hardy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was wandering about Malaya, staying here and there, a week or two if\nthere was a rest-house or a hotel, and a day or so if I was obliged to\ninflict myself on a planter or a District Officer whose hospitality I\nhad no wish to abuse; and at the moment I happened to be at Penang. It\nis a pleasant little town, with a hotel that has always seemed to me\nvery agreeable, but the stranger finds little to do there and time hung\na trifle heavily on my hands. One morning I received a letter from a man\nI knew only by name. This was Mark Featherstone. He was Acting Resident,\nin the absence on leave of the Resident, at a place called Tenggarah.\nThere was a sultan there and it appeared that a water festival of some\nsort was to take place which Featherstone thought would interest me. He\nsaid that he would be glad if I would come and stay with him for a few\ndays. I wired to tell him that I should be delighted and next day took\nthe train to Tenggarah. Featherstone met me at the station. He was a man\nof about thirty-five, I should think, tall and handsome, with fine eyes\nand a strong, stern face. He had a wiry black moustache and bushy\neyebrows. He looked more like a soldier than a government official. He\nwas very smart in white ducks, with a white topee, and he wore his\nclothes with elegance. He was a little shy, which seemed odd in a\nstrapping fellow of resolute mien, but I surmised that this was only\nbecause he was unused to the society of that strange fish, a writer, and\nI hoped in a little to put him at his ease.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My boys'll look after your barang,\" he said. \"We'll go down to the\nclub. Give them your keys and they'll unpack before we get back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI told him that I had a good deal of luggage and thought it better to\nleave everything at the station but what I particularly wanted. He would\nnot hear of it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It doesn't matter a bit. It'll be safer at my house. It's always better\nto have one's barang with one.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI gave my keys and the ticket for my trunk and my book-bag to a Chinese\nboy who stood at my host's elbow. Outside the station a car was waiting\nfor us and we stepped in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you play bridge?\" asked Featherstone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought most writers didn't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They don't,\" I said. \"It's generally considered among authors a sign of\ndeficient intelligence to play cards.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe club was a bungalow, pleasing but unpretentious; it had a large\nreading-room, a billiard-room with one table, and a small card-room.\nWhen we arrived it was empty but for one or two persons reading the\nEnglish weeklies, and we walked through to the tennis courts, where a\ncouple of sets were being played. A number of people were sitting on the\nverandah, looking on, smoking and sipping long drinks. I was introduced\nto one or two of them. But the light was failing and soon the players\ncould hardly see the ball. Featherstone asked one of the men I had been\nintroduced to if he would like a rubber. He said he would. Featherstone\nlooked about for a fourth. He caught sight of a man sitting a little by\nhimself, paused for a second, and went up to him. The two exchanged a\nfew words and then came towards us. We strolled in to the card-room. We\nhad a very nice game. I did not pay much attention to the two men who\nmade up the four. They stood me drinks and I, a temporary member of the\nclub, returned the compliment. The drinks were very small, quarter\nwhiskies, and in the two hours we played each of us was able to show his\nopen-handedness without an excessive consumption of alcohol. When the\nadvancing hour suggested that the next rubber must be the last we\nchanged from whisky to gin pahits. The rubber came to an end.\nFeatherstone called for the book and the winnings and losings of each\none of us were set down. One of the men got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I must be going,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Going back to the estate?\" asked Featherstone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes,\" he nodded. He turned to me. \"Shall you be here to-morrow?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope so.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went out of the room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll collect my mem and get along home to dinner,\" said the other.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We might be going too,\" said Featherstone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm ready whenever you are,\" I replied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe got into the car and drove to his house. It was a longish drive. In\nthe darkness I could see nothing much, but presently I realised that we\nwere going up a rather steep hill. We reached the Residency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt had been an evening like any other, pleasant, but not at all\nexciting, and I had spent I don't know how many just like it. I did not\nexpect it to leave any sort of impression on me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFeatherstone led me into his sitting-room. It looked comfortable, but it\nwas a trifle ordinary. It had large basket arm-chairs covered with\ncretonne and on the walls were a great many framed photographs; the\ntables were littered with papers, magazines and official reports, with\npipes, yellow tins of straight-cut cigarettes and pink tins of tobacco.\nIn a row of shelves were untidily stacked a good many books, their\nbindings stained with damp and the ravages of white ants. Featherstone\nshowed me my room and left me with the words:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shall you be ready for a gin pahit in ten minutes?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Easily,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had a bath and changed and went downstairs. Featherstone, ready before\nme, mixed our drink as he heard me clatter down the wooden staircase. We\ndined. We talked. The festival which I had been invited to see was the\nnext day but one, but Featherstone told me he had arranged for me before\nthat to be received by the Sultan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's a jolly old boy,\" he said. \"And the palace is a sight for sore\neyes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter dinner we talked a little more, Featherstone put on the\ngramophone, and we looked at the latest illustrated papers that had\narrived from England. Then we went to bed. Featherstone came to my room\nto see that I had everything I wanted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you haven't any books with you,\" he said. \"I haven't got a\nthing to read.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Books?\" I cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI pointed to my book-bag. It stood upright, bulging oddly, so that it\nlooked like a humpbacked gnome somewhat the worse for liquor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you got books in there? I thought that was your dirty linen or a\ncamp-bed or something. Is there anything you can lend me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look for yourself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFeatherstone's boys had unlocked the bag, but quailing before the sight\nthat then discovered itself had done no more. I knew from long\nexperience how to unpack it. I threw it over on its side, seized its\nleather bottom and, walking backwards, dragged the sack away from its\ncontents. A river of books poured on to the floor. A look of\nstupefaction came upon Featherstone's face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't mean to say you travel with as many books as that? By George,\nwhat a snip!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe bent down and turning them over rapidly looked at the titles. There\nwere books of all kinds. Volumes of verse, novels, philosophical works,\ncritical studies (they say books about books are profitless, but they\ncertainly make very pleasant reading), biographies, history; there were\nbooks to read when you were ill and books to read when your brain, all\nalert, craved for something to grapple with; there were books that you\nhad always wanted to read, but in the hurry of life at home had never\nfound time to; there were books to read at sea when you were meandering\nthrough narrow waters on a tramp steamer, and there were books for bad\nweather when your whole cabin creaked and you had to wedge yourself in\nyour bunk in order not to fall out; there were books chosen solely for\ntheir length, which you took with you when on some expedition you had to\ntravel light, and there were the books you could read when you could\nread nothing else. Finally Featherstone picked out a life of Byron that\nhad recently appeared.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hullo, what's this?\" he said. \"I read a review of it some time ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I believe it's very good,\" I replied. \"I haven't read it yet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"May I take it? It'll do me for to-night at all events.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course. Take anything you like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, that's enough. Well, good-night. Breakfast at eight-thirty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen I came down next morning the head-boy told me that Featherstone,\nwho had been at work since six, would be in shortly. While I waited for\nhim I glanced at his shelves.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see you've got a grand library of books on bridge,\" I remarked as we\nsat down to breakfast.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I get every one that comes out. I'm very keen on it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That fellow we were playing with yesterday plays a good game.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Which? Hardy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. Not the one who said he was going to collect his wife.\nThe other.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, that was Hardy. That was why I asked him to play. He doesn't come\nto the club very often.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope he will to-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't bank on it. He has an estate about thirty miles away. It's a\nlongish ride to come just for a rubber of bridge.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is he married?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. Well, yes. But his wife is in England.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must be awfully lonely for those men who live by themselves on those\nestates,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, he's not so badly off as some. I don't think he much cares about\nseeing people. I think he'd be just as lonely in London.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was something in the way Featherstone spoke that struck me as a\nlittle strange. His voice had what I can only describe as a shuttered\ntone. He seemed suddenly to have moved away from me. It was as though\none were passing along a street at night and paused for a second to look\nin at a lighted window that showed a comfortable room and suddenly an\ninvisible hand pulled down a blind. His eyes, which habitually met those\nof the person he was talking to with frankness, now avoided mine and I\nhad a notion that it was not only my fancy that read in his face an\nexpression of pain. It was drawn for a moment as it might be by a twinge\nof neuralgia. I could not think of anything to say and Featherstone did\nnot speak. I was conscious that his thoughts, withdrawn from me and what\nwe were about, were turned upon a subject unknown to me. Presently he\ngave a little sigh, very slight, but unmistakable, and seemed with a\ndeliberate effort to pull himself together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going down to the office immediately after breakfast,\" he said.\n\"What are you going to do with yourself?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, don't bother about me. I shall slack around. I'll stroll down and\nlook at the town.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's not much to see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All the better. I'm fed up with sights.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI found that Featherstone's verandah gave me sufficient entertainment\nfor the morning. It had one of the most enchanting views I had seen in\nthe F.M.S. The Residency was built on the top of a hill and the garden\nwas large and well-cared for. Great trees gave it almost the look of an\nEnglish park. It had vast lawns and there Tamils, black and emaciated,\nwere scything with deliberate and beautiful gestures. Beyond and below,\nthe jungle grew thickly to the bank of a broad, winding and swiftly\nflowing river, and on the other side of this, as far as the eye could\nreach, stretched the wooded hills of Tenggarah. The contrast between the\ntrim lawns, so strangely English, and the savage growth of the jungle\nbeyond pleasantly titillated the fancy. I sat and read and smoked. It is\nmy business to be curious about people and I asked myself how the peace\nof this scene, charged nevertheless with a tremulous and dark\nsignificance, affected Featherstone who lived with it. He knew it under\nevery aspect: at dawn when the mist rising from the river shrouded it\nwith a ghostly pall; in the splendour of noon; and at last when the\nshadowy gloaming crept softly out of the jungle, like an army making its\nway with caution in unknown country, and presently enveloped the green\nlawns and the great flowering trees and the flaunting cassias in the\nsilent night. I wondered whether, unbeknownst to him, the tender and yet\nstrangely sinister aspect of the scene, acting on his nerves and his\nloneliness, imbued him with some mystical quality so that the life he\nled, the life of the capable administrator, the sportsman and the good\nfellow, on occasion seemed to him not quite real. I smiled at my own\nfancies, for certainly the conversation we had had the night before had\nnot indicated in him any stirrings of the soul. I had thought him quite\nnice. He had been at Oxford and was a member of a good London club. He\nseemed to attach a good deal of importance to social things. He was a\ngentleman and slightly conscious of the fact that he belonged to a\nbetter class than most of the Englishmen his life brought him in contact\nwith. I gathered from the various silver pots that adorned his\ndining-room that he excelled in games. He played tennis and billiards.\nWhen he went on leave he hunted and, anxious to keep his weight down, he\ndieted carefully. He talked a good deal of what he would do when he\nretired. He hankered after the life of a country gentleman. A little\nhouse in Leicestershire, a couple of hunters and neighbours to play\nbridge with. He would have his pension and he had a little money of his\nown. But meanwhile he worked hard and did his work, if not brilliantly,\ncertainly with competence. I have no doubt that he was looked upon by\nhis superiors as a reliable officer. He was cut upon a pattern that I\nknew too well to find very interesting. He was like a novel that is\ncareful, honest and efficient, yet a little ordinary, so that you seem\nto have read it all before, and you turn the pages listlessly, knowing\nthat it will never afford you a surprise or move you to excitement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut human beings are incalculable and he is a fool who tells himself\nthat he knows what a man is capable of.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the afternoon Featherstone took me to see the Sultan. We were\nreceived by one of his sons, a shy, smiling youth who acted as his\nA.D.C. He was dressed in a neat blue suit, but round his waist he wore a\nsarong, white flowers on a yellow ground, on his head a red fez, and on\nhis feet knobby American shoes. The palace, built in the Moorish style,\nwas like a very big doll's house and it was painted bright yellow, which\nis the royal colour. We were led into a spacious room, furnished with\nthe sort of furniture you would find in an English lodging-house at the\nseaside, but the chairs were covered with yellow silk. On the floor was\na Brussels carpet and on the walls photographs in very grand gilt frames\nof the Sultan at various state functions. In a cabinet was a large\ncollection of all kinds of fruit done entirely in crochet work. The\nSultan came in with several attendants. He was a man of fifty, perhaps,\nshort and stout, dressed in trousers and tunic of a large\nwhite-and-yellow check; round his middle he wore a very beautiful yellow\nsarong and on his head a white fez. He had large handsome friendly eyes.\nHe gave us coffee to drink, sweet cakes to eat and cheroots to smoke.\nConversation was not difficult, for he was affable, and he told me that\nhe had never been to a theatre or played cards, for he was very\nreligious, and he had four wives and twenty-four children. The only bar\nto the happiness of his life seemed to be that common decency obliged\nhim to divide his time equally between his four wives. He said that an\nhour with one was a month and with another five minutes. I remarked that\nProfessor Einstein--or was it Bergson?--had made similar observations\nupon time and indeed on this question had given the world much to ponder\nover. Presently we took our leave and the Sultan presented me with some\nbeautiful white Malaccas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the evening we went to the club. One of the men we had played with\nthe day before got up from his chair as we entered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ready for a rubber?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where's our fourth?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, there are several fellows here who'll be glad to play.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What about that man we played with yesterday?\" I had forgotten his\nname.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hardy? He's not here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not worth while waiting for him,\" said Featherstone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He very seldom comes to the club. I was surprised to see him last\nnight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not know why I had the impression that behind the very ordinary\nwords of these two men there was an odd sense of embarrassment. Hardy\nhad made no impression on me and I did not even remember what he looked\nlike. He was just a fourth at the bridge table. I had a feeling that\nthey had something against him. It was no business of mine and I was\nquite content to play with a man who at that moment joined us. We\ncertainly had a more cheerful game than before. A good deal of chaff\npassed from one side of the table to the other. We played less serious\nbridge. We laughed. I wondered if it was only that they were less shy of\nthe stranger who had happened in upon them or if the presence of Hardy\nhad caused in the other two a certain constraint. At half-past eight we\nbroke up and Featherstone and I went back to dine at his house.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter dinner we lounged in arm-chairs and smoked cheroots. For some\nreason our conversation did not flow easily. I tried topic after topic,\nbut could not get Featherstone to interest himself in any of them. I\nbegan to think that in the last twenty-four hours he had said all he had\nto say. I fell somewhat discouraged into silence. It prolonged itself\nand again, I did not know why, I had a faint sensation that it was\ncharged with a significance that escaped me. I felt slightly\nuncomfortable. I had that queer feeling that one sometimes has when\nsitting in an empty room that one is not by oneself. Presently I was\nconscious that Featherstone was steadily looking at me. I was sitting by\na lamp, but he was in shadow so that the play of his features was hidden\nfrom me. But he had very large brilliant eyes and in the half darkness\nthey seemed to shine dimly. They were like new boot-buttons that caught\na reflected light. I wondered why he looked at me like that. I gave him\na glance and catching his eyes insistently fixed upon me faintly smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Interesting book that one you lent me last night,\" he said suddenly,\nand I could not help thinking his voice did not sound quite natural. The\nwords issued from his lips as though they were pushed from behind.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, the <i>Life of Byron</i>?\" I said breezily. \"Have you read it already?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A good deal of it. I read till three.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've heard it's very well done. I'm not sure that Byron interests me so\nmuch as all that. There was so much in him that was so frightfully\nsecond-rate. It makes one rather uncomfortable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you think is the real truth of that story about him and his\nsister?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Augusta Leigh? I don't know very much about it. I've never read\nA<i>starte</i>.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think they were really in love with one another?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose so. Isn't it generally believed that she was the only woman\nhe ever genuinely loved?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can you understand it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't really. It doesn't particularly shock me. It just seems to me\nvery unnatural. Perhaps 'unnatural' isn't the right word. It's\nincomprehensible to me. I can't throw myself into the state of feeling\nin which such a thing seems possible. You know, that's how a writer gets\nto know the people he writes about, by standing himself in their shoes\nand feeling with their hearts.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI knew I did not make myself very clear, but I was trying to describe a\nsensation, an action of the subconscious, which from experience was\nperfectly familiar to me, but which no words I knew could precisely\nindicate. I went on:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course she was only his half-sister, but just as habit kills love I\nshould have thought habit would prevent its arising. When two persons\nhave known one another all their lives and lived together in close\ncontact I can't imagine how or why that sudden spark should flash that\nresults in love. The probabilities are that they would be joined by\nmutual affection and I don't know anything that is more contrary to love\nthan affection.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI could just see in the dimness the outline of a smile flicker for a\nmoment on my host's heavy, and it seemed to me then, somewhat saturnine\nface.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You only believe in love at first sight?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I suppose I do, but with the proviso that people may have met\ntwenty times before seeing one another. 'Seeing' has an active side and\na passive one. Most people we run across mean so little to us that we\nnever bestir ourselves to look at them. We just suffer the impression\nthey make on us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, but one's often heard of couples who've known one another for years\nand it's never occurred to one they cared two straws for each other and\nsuddenly they go and get married. How do you explain that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if you're going to bully me into being logical and consistent, I\nshould suggest that their love is of a different kind. After all,\npassion isn't the only reason for marriage. It may not even be the best\none. Two people may marry because they're lonely or because they're good\nfriends or for convenience's sake. Though I said that affection was the\ngreatest enemy of love, I would never deny that it's a very good\nsubstitute. I'm not sure that a marriage founded on it isn't the\nhappiest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did you think of Tim Hardy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was a little surprised at the sudden question, which seemed to have\nnothing to do with the subject of our conversation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't think of him very much. He seemed quite nice. Why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did he seem to you just like everybody else?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. Is there anything peculiar about him? If you'd told me that, I'd\nhave paid more attention to him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's very quiet, isn't he? I suppose no one who knew nothing about him\nwould give him a second thought.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI tried to remember what he looked like. The only thing that had struck\nme when we were playing cards was that he had fine hands. It passed idly\nthrough my mind that they were not the sort of hands I should have\nexpected a planter to have. But why a planter should have different\nhands from anybody else I did not trouble to ask myself. His were\nsomewhat large, but very well formed with peculiarly long fingers, and\nthe nails were of an admirable shape. They were virile and yet oddly\nsensitive hands. I noticed this and thought no more about it. But if you\nare a writer instinct and the habit of years enable you to store up\nimpressions that you are not aware of. Sometimes of course they do not\ncorrespond with the facts and a woman for example may remain in your\nsubconsciousness as a dark, massive and ox-eyed creature when she is\nindeed rather small and of a nondescript colouring. But that is of no\nconsequence. The impression may very well be more exact than the sober\ntruth. And now, seeking to call up from the depths of me a picture of\nthis man I had a feeling of some ambiguity. He was clean-shaven and his\nface, oval but not thin, seemed strangely pale under the tan of long\nexposure to the tropical sun. His features were vague. I did not know\nwhether I remembered it or only imagined now that his rounded chin gave\none the impression of a certain weakness. He had thick brown hair, just\nturning grey, and a long wisp fell down constantly over his forehead. He\npushed it back with a gesture that had become habitual. His brown eyes\nwere rather large and gentle, but perhaps a little sad; they had a\nmelting softness which, I could imagine, might be very appealing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter a pause Featherstone continued:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's rather strange that I should run across Tim Hardy here after all\nthese years. But that's the way of the F.M.S. People move about and you\nfind yourself in the same place as a man you'd known years before in\nanother part of the country. I first knew Tim when he had an estate near\nSibuku. Have you ever been there?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. Where is it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, it's up north. Towards Siam. It wouldn't be worth your while to go.\nIt's just like every other place in the F.M.S. But it was rather nice.\nIt had a very jolly little club and there were some quite decent people.\nThere was the schoolmaster and the head of the police, the doctor, the\npadre and the government engineer. The usual lot, you know. A few\nplanters. Three or four women. I was A.D.O. It was one of my first jobs.\nTim Hardy had an estate about twenty-five miles away. He lived there\nwith his sister. They had a bit of money of their own and he'd bought\nthe place. Rubber was pretty good then and he wasn't doing at all badly.\nWe rather cottoned on to one another. Of course it's a toss-up with\nplanters. Some of them are very good fellows, but they're not\nexactly...\" he sought for a word or a phrase that did not sound\nsnobbish.  \"Well, they're not the sort of people you'd be likely to\nmeet at home.  Tim and Olive were of one's own class, if you understand\nwhat I mean.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Olive was the sister?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. They'd had a rather unfortunate past. Their parents had separated\nwhen they were quite small, seven or eight, and the mother had taken\nOlive and the father had kept Tim. Tim went to Clifton, they were West\nCountry people, and only came home for the holidays. His father was a\nretired naval man who lived at Fowey. But Olive went with her mother to\nItaly. She was educated in Florence; she spoke Italian perfectly and\nFrench too. For all those years Tim and Olive never saw one another\nonce, but they used to write to one another regularly. They'd been very\nmuch attached when they were children. As far as I could understand,\nlife when their people were living together had been rather stormy with\nall sorts of scenes and upsets, you know the sort of thing that happens\nwhen two people who are married don't get on together, and that had\nthrown them on their own resources. They were left a good deal to\nthemselves. Then Mrs. Hardy died and Olive came home to England and went\nback to her father. She was eighteen then and Tim was seventeen. A year\nlater the war broke out. Tim joined up and his father, who was over\nfifty, got some job at Portsmouth. I take it he had been a hard liver\nand a heavy drinker. He broke down before the end of the war and died\nafter a lingering illness. They don't seem to have had any relations.\nThey were the last of a rather old family; they had a fine old house in\nDorsetshire that had belonged to them for a good many generations, but\nthey had never been able to afford to live in it and it was always let.\nI remember seeing photographs of it. It was very much a gentleman's\nhouse, of grey stone and rather stately, with a coat of arms carved over\nthe front door and mullioned windows. Their great ambition was to make\nenough money to be able to live in it. They used to talk about it a lot.\nThey never spoke as though either of them would marry, but always as\nthough it were a settled thing that they would remain together. It was\nrather funny considering how young they were.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How old were they then?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I suppose he was twenty-five or twenty-six and she was a year\nolder. They were awfully kind to me when I first went up to Sibuku. They\ntook a fancy to me at once. You see, we had more in common than most of\nthe people there. I think they were glad of my company. They weren't\nparticularly popular.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why not?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They were rather reserved and you couldn't help seeing that they liked\ntheir own society better than other people's. I don't know if you've\nnoticed it, but that always seems to put people's backs up. They resent\nit somehow if they have a feeling that you can get along very well\nwithout them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's tiresome, isn't it?\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was rather a grievance to the other planters that Tim was his own\nmaster and had private means. They had to put up with an old Ford to get\nabout in, but Tim had a real car. Tim and Olive were very nice when they\ncame to the club and they played in the tennis tournaments and all that\nsort of thing, but you had an impression that they were always glad to\nget away again. They'd dine out with people and make themselves very\npleasant, but it was pretty obvious that they'd just as soon have stayed\nat home. If you had any sense you couldn't blame them. I don't know if\nyou've been much to planters' houses. They're a bit dreary. A lot of\ngimcrack furniture and silver ornaments and tiger skins. And the food's\nuneatable. But the Hardys had made their bungalow rather nice. There was\nnothing very grand in it; it was just easy and homelike and comfortable.\nTheir living-room was like a drawing-room in an English country house.\nYou felt that their things meant something to them and that they had had\nthem a long time. It was a very jolly house to stay at. The bungalow was\nin the middle of the estate, but it was on the brow of a little hill and\nyou looked right over the rubber trees to the sea in the distance. Olive\ntook a lot of trouble with her garden and it was really topping. I never\nsaw such a show of cannas. I used to go there for week-ends. It was only\nabout half an hour's drive to the sea and we'd take our lunch with us\nand bathe and sail. Tim kept a small boat there. Those days were grand.\nI never knew one could enjoy oneself so much. It's a beautiful bit of\ncoast and it was really extraordinarily romantic. Then in the evenings\nwe'd play patience and chess or turn on the gramophone. The cooking was\ndamned good too. It was a change from what one generally got. Olive had\ntaught their cook to make all sorts of Italian dishes and we used to\nhave great wallops of macaroni and risotto and gnocchi and things like\nthat. I couldn't help envying them their life, it was so jolly and\npeaceful, and when they talked of what they'd do when they went back to\nEngland for good I used to tell them they'd always regret what they'd\nleft.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'We've been very happy here,' said Olive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She had a way of looking at Tim, with a slow, sidelong glance from\nunder her long eyelashes, that was rather engaging.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In their own house they were quite different from what they were when\nthey went out. They were so easy and cordial. Everybody admitted that\nand I'm bound to say that people enjoyed going there. They often asked\npeople over. They had the gift of making you feel at home. It was a very\nhappy house, if you know what I mean. Of course no one could help seeing\nhow attached they were to one another. And whatever people said about\ntheir being stand-offish and self-centred, they were bound to be rather\ntouched by the affection they had for one another. People said they\ncouldn't have been more united if they were married, and when you saw\nhow some couples got on you couldn't help thinking they made most\nmarriages look rather like a wash-out. They seemed to think the same\nthings at the same time. They had little private jokes that made them\nlaugh like children. They were so charming with one another, so gay and\nhappy, that really to stay with them was, well, a spiritual refreshment.\nI don't know what else you could call it. When you left them, after a\ncouple of days at the bungalow, you felt that you'd absorbed some of\ntheir peace and their sober gaiety. It was as though your soul had been\nsluiced with cool clear water. You felt strangely purified.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was singular to hear Featherstone talking in this exalted strain. He\nlooked so spruce in his smart white coat, technically known as a\nbum-freezer, his moustache was so trim, his thick curly hair so\ncarefully brushed, that his high-flown language made me a trifle\nuncomfortable. But I realised that he was trying to express in his\nclumsy way a very sincerely felt emotion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What was Olive Hardy like?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll show you. I've got quite a lot of snapshots.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got up from his chair and going to a shelf brought me a large album.\nIt was the usual thing, indifferent photographs of people in groups and\nunflattering likenesses of single figures. They were in bathing dress or\nin shorts or tennis things, generally with their faces screwed up\nbecause the sun blinded them, or puckered by the distortion of laughter.\nI recognised Hardy, not much changed after ten years, with his wisp of\nhair hanging across his forehead. I remembered him better now that I saw\nthe snapshots. In them he looked nice and fresh and young. He had an\nalertness of expression that was attractive and that I certainly had not\nnoticed when I saw him. In his eyes was a sort of eagerness for life\nthat danced and sparkled through the fading print. I glanced at the\nphotographs of his sister. Her bathing dress showed that she had a good\nfigure, well-developed, but slender; and her legs were long and slim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They look rather alike,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, although she was a year older they might have been twins, they\nwere so much alike. They both had the same oval face and that pale skin\nwithout any colour in the cheeks, and they both had those soft brown\neyes, very liquid and appealing, so that you felt whatever they did you\ncould never be angry with them. And they both had a sort of careless\nelegance that made them look charming whatever they wore and however\nuntidy they were. He's lost that now, I suppose, but he certainly had it\nwhen I first knew him. They always rather reminded me of the brother and\nsister in <i>Twelfth Night</i>. You know whom I mean.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Viola and Sebastian.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They never seemed to belong quite to the present. There was something\nElizabethan about them. I don't think it was only because I was very\nyoung then that I couldn't help feeling they were strangely romantic\nsomehow. I could see them living in Illyria.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI gave one of the snapshots another glance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The girl looks as though she had a good deal more character than her\nbrother,\" I remarked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She had. I don't know if you'd have called Olive beautiful, but she was\nawfully attractive. There was something poetic in her, a sort of lyrical\nquality, as it were, that coloured her movements, her acts and\neverything about her. It seemed to exalt her above common cares. There\nwas something so candid in her expression, so courageous and independent\nin her bearing, that--oh, I don't know, it made mere beauty just flat\nand dull.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You speak as if you'd been in love with her,\" I interrupted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I was. I should have thought you'd guessed that at once. I\nwas frightfully in love with her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Was it love at first sight?\" I smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I think it was, but I didn't know it for a month or so. When it\nsuddenly struck me that what I felt for her--I don't know how to explain\nit, it was a sort of shattering turmoil that affected every bit of\nme--that that was love, I knew I'd felt it all along. It was not only\nher looks, though they were awfully alluring, the smoothness of her pale\nskin and the way her hair fell over her forehead and the grave sweetness\nof her brown eyes, it was more than that; you had a sensation of\nwell-being when you were with her, as though you could relax and be\nquite natural and needn't pretend to be anything you weren't. You felt\nshe was incapable of meanness. It was impossible to think of her as\nenvious of other people or catty. She seemed to have a natural\ngenerosity of soul. One could be silent with her for an hour at a time\nand yet feel that one had had a good time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A rare gift,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was a wonderful companion. If you made a suggestion to do something\nshe was always glad to fall in with it. She was the least exacting girl\nI ever knew. You could throw her over at the last minute and however\ndisappointed she was it made no difference. Next time you saw her she\nwas just as cordial and serene as ever.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why didn't you marry her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFeatherstone's cheroot had gone out. He threw the stub away and\ndeliberately lit another. He did not answer for a while. It may seem\nstrange to persons who live in a highly civilised state that he should\nconfide these intimate things to a stranger; it did not seem strange to\nme. I was used to it. People who live so desperately alone, in the\nremote places of the earth, find it a relief to tell someone whom in all\nprobability they will never meet again the story that has burdened\nperhaps for years their waking thoughts and their dreams at night. And I\nhave an inkling that the fact of your being a writer attracts their\nconfidence. They feel that what they tell you will excite your interest\nin an impersonal way that makes it easier for them to discharge their\nsouls. Besides, as we all know from our own experience, it is never\nunpleasant to talk about oneself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why didn't you marry her?\" I had asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wanted to badly enough,\" Featherstone answered at length. \"But I\nhesitated to ask her. Although she was always so nice to me and so easy\nto get on with, and we were such good friends, I always felt that there\nwas something a little mysterious in her. Although she was so simple, so\nfrank and natural, you never quite got over the feeling of an inner\nkernel of aloofness, as if deep in her heart she guarded, not a secret,\nbut a sort of privacy of the soul that not a living person would ever be\nallowed to know. I don't know if I make myself clear.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think so.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I put it down to her upbringing. They never talked of their mother, but\nsomehow I got the impression that she was one of those neurotic,\nemotional women who wreck their own happiness and are a pest to everyone\nconnected with them. I had a suspicion that she'd led rather a hectic\nlife in Florence and it struck me that Olive owed her beautiful serenity\nto a disciplined effort of her own will and that her aloofness was a\nsort of citadel she'd built to protect herself from the knowledge of all\nsorts of shameful things. But of course that aloofness was awfully\ncaptivating. It was strangely exciting to think that if she loved you,\nand you were married to her, you would at last pierce right into the\nhidden heart of that mystery; and you felt that if you could share that\nwith her it would be as it were a consummation of all you'd ever desired\nin your life. Heaven wouldn't be in it. You know, I felt about it just\nlike Bluebeard's wife about the forbidden chamber in the castle. Every\nroom was open to me, but I should never rest till I had gone into that\nlast one that was locked against me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy eye was caught by a chik-chak, a little brown house lizard with a\nlarge head, high up on the wall. It is a friendly little beast and it is\ngood to see it in a house. It watched a fly. It was quite still. On a\nsudden it made a dart and then as the fly flew away fell back with a\nsort of jerk into a strange immobility.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And there was another thing that made me hesitate. I couldn't bear the\nthought that if I proposed to her and she refused me she wouldn't let me\ncome to the bungalow in the same old way. I should have hated that, I\nenjoyed going there so awfully. It made me so happy to be with her. But\nyou know, sometimes one can't help oneself. I did ask her at last, but\nit was almost by accident. One evening, after dinner, when we were\nsitting on the verandah by ourselves, I took her hand. She withdrew it\nat once.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Why did you do that?' I asked her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I don't very much like being touched,' she said. She turned her head a\nlittle and smiled. 'Are you hurt? You mustn't mind, it's just a funny\nfeeling I have. I can't help it.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I wonder if it's ever occurred to you that I'm frightfully fond of\nyou,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I expect I was terribly awkward about it, but I'd never proposed to\nanyone before.\" Featherstone gave a little sound that was not quite a\nchuckle and not quite a sigh. \"For the matter of that, I've never\nproposed to anyone since. She didn't say anything for a minute. Then she\nsaid:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I'm very glad, but I don't think I want you to be anything more than\nthat.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Why not?' I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I could never leave Tim.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'But supposing he marries?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He never will.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd gone so far then that I thought I'd better go on. But my throat was\nso dry that I could hardly speak. I was shaking with nervousness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I'm frightfully in love with you, Olive. I want to marry you more than\nanything in the world.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She put her hand very gently on my arm. It was like a flower falling to\nthe ground.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No, dear, I can't,' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was silent. It was difficult for me to say what I wanted to. I'm\nnaturally rather shy. She was a girl. I couldn't very well tell her that\nit wasn't quite the same thing living with a husband and living with a\nbrother. She was normal and healthy; she must want to have babies; it\nwasn't reasonable to starve her natural instincts. It was such waste of\nher youth. But it was she who spoke first.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Don't let's talk about this any more,' she said. 'D'you mind? It did\nstrike me once or twice that perhaps you cared for me. Tim noticed it. I\nwas sorry because I was afraid it would break up our friendship. I don't\nwant it to do that, Mark. We do get on so well together, the three of\nus, and we have such jolly times. I don't know what we should do without\nyou now.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I thought of that too,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'D'you think it need?' she asked me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'My dear, I don't want it to,' I said. 'You must know how much I love\ncoming here. I've never been so happy anywhere before!'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You're not angry with me?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Why should I be? It's not your fault. It only means that you're not in\nlove with me. If you were you wouldn't care a hang about Tim.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You are rather sweet,' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She put her arm round my neck and kissed me lightly on the cheek. I had\na notion that in her mind it settled our relation. She adopted me as a\nsecond brother.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A few weeks later Tim went back to England. The tenant of their house\nin Dorset was leaving and though there was another in the offing, he\nthought he ought to be on the spot to conduct negotiations. And he\nwanted some new machinery for the estate. He thought he'd get it at the\nsame time. He didn't expect to be gone more than three months and Olive\nmade up her mind not to go. She knew hardly anyone in England, and it\nwas practically a foreign country to her, she didn't mind being left\nalone, and she wanted to look after the estate. Of course they could\nhave put a manager in charge, but that wasn't the same thing. Rubber was\nfalling and in case of accidents it was just as well that one or other\nof them should be there. I promised Tim I'd look after her and if she\nwanted me she could always call me up. My proposal hadn't changed\nanything. We carried on as though nothing had happened. I don't know\nwhether she'd told Tim. He made no sign that he knew. Of course I loved\nher as much as ever, but I kept it to myself. I have a good deal of\nself-control, you know. I had a sort of feeling I hadn't a chance. I\nhoped eventually my love would change into something else and we could\njust be wonderful friends. It's funny, it never has, you know. I suppose\nI was hit too badly ever to get quite over it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She went down to Penang to see Tim off and when she came back I met her\nat the station and drove her home. I couldn't very well stay at the\nbungalow while Tim was away, but I went over every Sunday and had tiffin\nand we'd go down to the sea and have a bathe. People tried to be kind to\nher and asked her to stay with them, but she wouldn't. She seldom left\nthe estate. She had plenty to do. She read a lot. She was never bored.\nShe seemed quite happy in her own company, and when she had visitors it\nwas only from a sense of duty. She didn't want them to think her\nungracious. But it was an effort and she told me she heaved a sigh of\nrelief when she saw the last of them and could again enjoy without\ndisturbance the peaceful loneliness of the bungalow. She was a very\ncurious girl. It was strange that at her age she should be so\nindifferent to parties and the other small gaieties the station\nafforded. Spiritually, if you know what I mean, she was entirely\nself-supporting. I don't know how people found out that I was in love\nwith her; I thought I'd never given myself away in anything, but I had\nhints here and there that they knew. I gathered they thought Olive\nhadn't gone home with her brother on my account. One woman, a Mrs.\nSergison, the policeman's wife, actually asked me when they were going\nto be able to congratulate me. Of course I pretended I didn't know what\nshe was talking about, but it didn't go down very well. I couldn't help\nbeing amused. I meant so little to Olive in that way that I really\nbelieve she'd entirely forgotten that I'd asked her to marry me. I can't\nsay she was unkind to me, I don't think she could have been unkind to\nanyone; but she treated me with just the casualness with which a sister\nmight treat a younger brother. She was two or three years older than I.\nShe was always terribly glad to see me, but it never occurred to her to\nput herself out for me; she was almost amazingly intimate with me, but\nunconsciously, you know, as you might be with a person you'd known so\nwell all your life that you never thought of putting on frills with him.\nI might not have been a man at all, but an old coat that she wore all\nthe time because it was easy and comfortable and she didn't mind what\nshe did in it. I should have been crazy not to see that she was a\nthousand miles away from loving me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then one day, three or four weeks before Tim was due back, when I went\nto the bungalow I saw she'd been crying. I was startled. She was always\nso composed. I'd never seen her upset over anything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Hullo, what's the matter?' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Nothing.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Come off it, darling,' I said. 'What have you been crying about?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She tried to smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I wish you hadn't got such sharp eyes,' she said. 'I think I'm being\nsilly. I've just had a cable from Tim to say he's postponed his\nsailing.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, my dear, I am sorry,' I said. 'You must be awfully disappointed.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I've been counting the days. I want him back so badly.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Does he say why he's postponing?' I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No, he says he's writing. I'll show you the cable.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I saw that she was very nervous. Her slow quiet eyes were filled with\napprehension and there was a little frown of anxiety between her brows.\nShe went into her bedroom and in a moment came back with the cable. I\nfelt that she was watching me anxiously as I read. So far as I remember\nit ran: <i>Darling, I cannot sail on the seventh after all. Please forgive\nme. Am writing fully. Fondest love. Tim.</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Well, perhaps the machinery he wanted isn't ready and he can't bring\nhimself to sail without it,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What could it matter if it came by a later ship? Anyhow, it'll be hung\nup at Penang.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It may be something about the house.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'If it is why doesn't he say so? He must know how frightfully anxious I\nam.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It wouldn't occur to him,' I said. 'After all, when you're away you\ndon't realise that the people you've left behind don't know something\nthat you take as a matter of course.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She smiled again, but now more happily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I dare say you're right. In point of fact Tim is a little like that.\nHe's always been rather slack and casual. I dare say I've been making a\nmountain out of a molehill. I must just wait patiently for his letter.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Olive was a girl with a lot of self-control and I saw her by an effort\nof will pull herself together. The little line between her eyebrows\nvanished and she was once more her serene, smiling and kindly self. She\nwas always gentle: that day she had a mildness so heavenly that it was\nshattering. But for the rest of the time I could see that she kept her\nrestlessness in check only by the deliberate exercise of her common\nsense. It was as though she had a foreboding of ill. I was with her the\nday before the mail was due. Her anxiety was all the more pitiful to see\nbecause she took such pains to hide it. I was always busy on mail day,\nbut I promised to go up to the estate later on and hear the news. I was\njust thinking of starting when Hardy's seis came along in the car with a\nmessage from the amah asking me to go at once to her mistress. The amah\nwas a decent, elderly woman to whom I had given a dollar or two and said\nthat if anything went wrong on the estate she was to let me know at\nonce. I jumped into my car. When I arrived I found the amah waiting for\nme on the steps.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'A letter came this morning,' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I interrupted her. I ran up the steps. The sitting-room was empty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Olive,' I called.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I went into the passage and suddenly I heard a sound that froze my\nheart. The amah had followed me and now she opened the door of Olive's\nroom. The sound I had heard was the sound of Olive crying. I went in.\nShe was lying on her bed, on her face, and her sobs shook her from head\nto foot. I put my hand on her shoulder.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Olive, what is it?' I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Who's that?' she cried. She sprang to her feet suddenly, as though she\nwere scared out of her wits. And then: 'Oh, it's you,' she said. She\nstood in front of me, with her head thrown back and her eyes closed, and\nthe tears streamed from them. It was dreadful. 'Tim's married,' she\ngasped, and her face screwed up in a sort of grimace of pain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must admit that for one moment I had a thrill of exultation, it was\nlike a little electric shock tingling through my heart; it struck me\nthat now I had a chance, she might be willing to marry me; I know it was\nterribly selfish of me; you see, the news had taken me by surprise; but\nit was only for a moment, after that I was melted by her awful distress\nand the only thing I felt was deep sorrow because she was unhappy. I put\nmy arm round her waist.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, my dear, I'm so sorry,' I said. 'Don't stay here. Come into the\nsitting-room and sit down and we'll talk about it. Let me give you\nsomething to drink.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She let me lead her into the next room and we sat down on the sofa. I\ntold the amah to fetch the whisky and syphon and I mixed her a good\nstrong stengah and made her drink a little. I took her in my arms and\nrested her head on my shoulder. She let me do what I liked with her. The\ngreat tears streamed down her poor face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'How could he?' she moaned. 'How could he?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'My darling,' I said, 'it was bound to happen sooner or later. He's a\nyoung man. How could you expect him never to marry? It's only natural.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No, no, no,' she gasped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tight-clenched in her hand I saw that she had a letter and I guessed\nthat it was Tim's.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What does he say?' I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She gave a frightened movement and clutched the letter to her heart as\nthough she thought I would take it from her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He says he couldn't help himself. He says he had to. What does it\nmean?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Well, you know, in his way he's just as attractive as you are. He has\nso much charm. I suppose he just fell madly in love with some girl and\nshe with him.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He's so weak,' she moaned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Are they coming out?' I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'They sailed yesterday. He says it won't make any difference. He's\ninsane. How <i>can</i> I stay here?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She began to cry hysterically. It was torture to see that girl, usually\nso calm, utterly shattered by her emotion. I had always felt that her\nlovely serenity masked a capacity for deep feeling. But the abandon of\nher distress simply broke me up. I held her in my arms and kissed her,\nher eyes and her wet cheek and her hair. I don't think she knew what I\nwas doing. I was hardly conscious of it myself. I was so deeply moved.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What shall I do?' she wailed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Why won't you marry me?' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She tried to withdraw herself from me, but I wouldn't let her go.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'After all, it would be a way out,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'How can I marry you?' she moaned. 'I'm years older than you are.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, what nonsense, two or three. What do I care?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No, no.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Why not?' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I don't love you,' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What does that matter? I love you.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what I said. I told her that I'd try to make her happy. I\nsaid I'd never ask anything from her but what she was prepared to give\nme. I talked and talked. I tried to make her see reason. I felt that she\ndidn't want to stay there, in the same place as Tim, and I told her that\nI'd be moved soon to some other district. I thought that might tempt\nher. She couldn't deny that we'd always got on awfully well together.\nAfter a time she did seem to grow a little quieter. I had a feeling that\nshe was listening to me. I had even a sort of feeling that she knew that\nshe was lying in my arms and that it comforted her. I made her drink a\ndrop more whisky. I gave her a cigarette. At last I thought I might be\njust mildly facetious.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You know, I'm not a bad sort really,' I said. 'You might do worse.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You don't know me,' she said. 'You know nothing whatever about me.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I'm capable of learning,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She smiled a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You're awfully kind, Mark,' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Say yes, Olive,' I begged.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She gave a deep sigh. For a long time she stared at the ground. But she\ndid not move and I felt the softness of her body in my arms. I waited. I\nwas frightfully nervous and the minutes seemed endless.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'All right,' she said at last, as though she were not conscious that\nany time had passed between my prayer and her answer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was so moved that I had nothing to say. But when I wanted to kiss her\nlips, she turned her face away, and wouldn't let me. I wanted us to be\nmarried at once, but she was quite firm that she wouldn't. She insisted\non waiting till Tim came back. You know how sometimes you see so clearly\nin people's thoughts that you're more certain of them than if they'd\nspoken them; I saw that she couldn't quite believe that what Tim had\nwritten was true and that she had a sort of miserable hope that it was\nall a mistake and he wasn't married after all. It gave me a pang, but I\nloved her so much, I just bore it. I was willing to bear anything, I\nadored her. She wouldn't even let me tell anyone that we were engaged.\nShe made me promise not to say a word till Tim's return. She said she\ncouldn't bear the thought of the congratulations and all that. She\nwouldn't even let me make any announcement of Tim's marriage. She was\nobstinate about it. I had a notion that she felt if the fact were spread\nabout it gave it a certainty that she didn't want it to have.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But the matter was taken out of her hands. News travels mysteriously in\nthe East. I don't know what Olive had said in the amah's hearing when\nfirst she received the news of Tim's marriage; anyhow, the Hardy's seis\ntold the Sergisons' and Mrs. Sergison attacked me the next time I went\ninto the club.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I hear Tim Hardy's married,' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh?' I answered, unwilling to commit myself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She smiled at my blank face, and told me that her amah having told her\nthe rumour she had rung up Olive and asked her if it was true. Olive's\nanswer had been rather odd. She had not exactly confirmed it, but said\nthat she had received a letter from Tim telling her he was married.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'She's a strange girl,' said Mrs. Sergison. 'When I asked her for\ndetails she said she had none to give and when I said: \"Aren't you\nthrilled?\" she didn't answer.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Olive's devoted to Tim, Mrs. Sergison,' I said. 'His marriage has\nnaturally been a shock to her. She knows nothing about Tim's wife. She's\nnervous about her.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'And when are you two going to be married?' she asked me abruptly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What an embarrassing question!' I said, trying to laugh it off.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She looked at me shrewdly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Will you give me your word of honour that you're not engaged to her?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't like to tell her a deliberate lie, nor to ask her to mind her\nown business, and I'd promised Olive faithfully that I would say nothing\ntill Tim got back. I hedged.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Mrs. Sergison,' I said, 'when there's anything to tell I promise that\nyou'll be the first person to hear it. All I can say to you now is that\nI do want to marry Olive more than anything in the world.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I'm very glad that Tim's married,' she answered. 'And I hope she'll\nmarry you very soon. It was a morbid and unhealthy life that they led up\nthere, those two, they kept far too much to themselves and they were far\ntoo much absorbed in one another.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I saw Olive practically every day. I felt that she didn't want me to\nmake love to her, and I contented myself with kissing her when I came\nand when I went. She was very nice to me, kindly and thoughtful; I knew\nshe was glad to see me and sorry when it was time for me to go.\nOrdinarily, she was apt to fall into silence, but during this time she\ntalked more than I had ever heard her talk before. But never of the\nfuture and never of Tim and his wife. She told me a lot about her life\nin Florence with her mother. She had led a strange lonely life, mostly\nwith servants and governesses, while her mother, I suspected, engaged in\none affair after another with vague Italian counts and Russian princes.\nI guessed that by the time she was fourteen there wasn't much she didn't\nknow. It was natural for her to be quite unconventional: in the only\nworld she knew till she was eighteen conventions weren't mentioned\nbecause they didn't exist. Gradually, Olive seemed to regain her\nserenity and I should have thought that she was beginning to accustom\nherself to the thought of Tim's marriage if it hadn't been that I\ncouldn't but notice how pale and tired she looked. I made up my mind\nthat the moment he arrived I'd press her to marry me at once. I could\nget short leave whenever I asked for it, and by the time that was up I\nthought I could manage a transfer to some other post. What she wanted\nwas change of air and fresh scenes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We knew, of course, within a day when Tim's ship would reach Penang,\nbut it was a question whether she'd get in soon enough for him to catch\nthe train and I wrote to the P. &amp; O. agent asking him to telegraph as\nsoon as he had definite news. When I got the wire and took it up to\nOlive I found that she'd just received one from Tim. The ship had docked\nearly and he was arriving next day. The train was supposed to get in at\neight o'clock in the morning, but it was liable to be anything from one\nto six hours late, and I bore with me an invitation from Mrs. Sergison\nasking Olive to come back with me to stay the night with her so that she\nwould be on the spot and need not go to the station till the news came\nthrough that the train was coming.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was immensely relieved. I thought that when the blow at last fell\nOlive wouldn't feel it so much. She had worked herself up into such a\nstate that I couldn't help thinking that she must have a reaction now.\nShe might take a fancy to her sister-in-law. There was no reason why\nthey shouldn't all three get on very well together. To my surprise Olive\nsaid she wasn't coming down to the station to meet them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'They'll be awfully disappointed,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I'd rather wait here,' she answered. She smiled a little. 'Don't argue\nwith me, Mark, I've quite made up my mind.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I've ordered breakfast in my house,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'That's all right. You meet them and take them to your house and give\nthem breakfast, and then they can come along here afterwards. Of course\nI'll send the car down.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I don't suppose they'll want to breakfast if you're not there,' I\nsaid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, I'm sure they will. If the train gets in on time they wouldn't\nhave thought of breakfasting before it arrived and they'll be hungry.\nThey won't want to take this long drive without anything to eat.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was puzzled. She had been looking forward so intensely to Tim's\ncoming, it seemed strange that she should want to wait all by herself\nwhile the rest of us were having a jolly breakfast. I supposed she was\nnervous and wanted to delay as long as possible meeting the strange\nwoman who had come to take her place. It seemed unreasonable, I couldn't\nsee that an hour sooner or an hour later could make any difference, but\nI knew women were funny, and anyhow I felt Olive wasn't in the mood for\nme to press it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Telephone when you're starting so that I shall know when to expect\nyou,' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'All right,' I said, 'but you know I shan't be able to come with them.\nIt's my day for going to Lahad.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This was a town that I had to go to once a week to take cases. It was a\ngood way off and one had to ferry across a river, which took some time,\nso that I never got back till late. There were a few Europeans there and\na club. I generally had to go on there for a bit to be sociable and see\nthat things were getting along all right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Besides,' I added, 'with Tim bringing his wife home for the first time\nI don't suppose he'll want me about. But if you'd like to ask me to\ndinner I'll be glad to come to that.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Olive smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I don't think it'll be my place to issue any more invitations, will\nit?' she said. 'You must ask the bride.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She said this so lightly that my heart leaped. I had a feeling that at\nlast she had made up her mind to accept the altered circumstances and,\nwhat was more, was accepting them with cheerfulness. She asked me to\nstay to dinner. Generally I left about eight and dined at home. She was\nvery sweet, almost tender, and I was happier than I'd been for weeks. I\nhad never been more desperately in love with her. I had a couple of gin\npahits and I think I was in rather good form at dinner. I know I made\nher laugh. I felt that at last she was casting away the load of misery\nthat had oppressed her. That was why I didn't let myself be very much\ndisturbed by what happened at the end.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Don't you think it's about time you were leaving a presumably maiden\nlady?' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She spoke in a manner that was so quietly gay that I answered without\nhesitation:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, my dear, if you think you've got a shred of reputation left you\ndeceive yourself. You're surely not under the impression that the ladies\nof Sibuku don't know that I've been coming to see you every day for a\nmonth. The general feeling is that if we're not married it's high time\nwe were. Don't you think it would be just as well if I broke it to them\nthat we're engaged?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, Mark, you mustn't take our engagement very seriously,' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'How else do you expect me to take it? It is serious.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She shook her head a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No. I was upset and hysterical that day. You were being very sweet to\nme. I said yes because I was too miserable to say no. But now I've had\ntime to collect myself. Don't think me unkind. I made a mistake. I've\nbeen very much to blame. You must forgive me.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, darling, you're talking nonsense. You've got nothing against me.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She looked at me steadily. She was quite calm. She had even a little\nsmile at the back of her eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I can't marry you. I can't marry anyone. It was absurd of me ever to\nthink I could.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't answer at once. She was in a queer state and I thought it\nbetter not to insist.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I suppose I can't drag you to the altar by main force,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I held out my hand and she gave me hers. I put my arm round her, and\nshe made no attempt to withdraw. She suffered me to kiss her as usual on\nher cheek.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Next morning I met the train. For once in a way it was punctual. Tim\nwaved to me as his carriage passed the place where I was standing, and\nby the time I had walked up he had already jumped out and was handing\ndown his wife. He grasped my hand warmly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Where's Olive?' he said, with a glance along the platform. 'This is\nSally.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shook hands with her and at the same time explained why Olive was not\nthere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It was frightfully early, wasn't it?' said Mrs. Hardy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I told them that the plan was for them to come and have a bit of\nbreakfast at my house and then drive home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I'd love a bath,' said Mrs. Hardy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You shall have one,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was really an extremely pretty little thing, very fair, with\nenormous blue eyes and a lovely little straight nose. Her skin, all milk\nand roses, was exquisite. A little of the chorus girl type, of course,\nand you may happen to think that rather namby-pamby, but in that style\nshe was enchanting. We drove to my house, they both had a bath and Tim a\nshave; I just had two minutes alone with him. He asked me how Olive had\ntaken his marriage. I told him she'd been upset.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I was afraid so,' he said, frowning a little. He gave a short sigh. 'I\ncouldn't do anything else.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't understand what he meant. At that moment Mrs. Hardy joined us\nand slipped her arm through her husband's. He took her hand in his and\ngently pressed it. He gave her a look that had in it something pleased\nand humorously affectionate, as though he didn't take her quite\nseriously, but enjoyed his sense of proprietorship and was proud of her\nbeauty. She really was lovely. She was not at all shy, she asked me to\ncall her Sally before we'd known one another ten minutes, and she was\nquick in the uptake. Of course, just then she was excited at arriving.\nShe'd never been East and everything thrilled her. It was quite obvious\nthat she was head over heels in love with Tim. Her eyes never left him\nand she hung on his words. We had a jolly breakfast and then we parted.\nThey got into their car to go home and I into mine to go to Lahad. I\npromised to go straight to the estate from there and in point of fact it\nwas out of my way to pass by my house. I took a change with me. I didn't\nsee why Olive shouldn't like Sally very much, she was frank and gay, and\ningenuous; she was extremely young, she couldn't have been more than\nnineteen, and her wonderful prettiness couldn't fail to appeal to Olive.\nI was just as glad to have had a reasonable excuse to leave the three of\nthem by themselves for the day, but as I started out from Lahad I had a\nnotion that by the time I arrived they would all be pleased to see me. I\ndrove up to the bungalow and blew my horn two or three times, expecting\nsomeone to appear. Not a soul. The place was in total darkness. I was\nsurprised. It was absolutely silent. I couldn't make it out. They must\nbe in. Very odd, I thought. I waited a moment, then got out of the car\nand walked up the steps. At the top of them I stumbled over something. I\nswore and bent down to see what it was; it had felt like a body. There\nwas a cry and I saw it was the amah. She shrank back cowering as I\ntouched her and broke into loud wails.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What the hell's the matter?' I cried, and then I felt a hand on my arm\nand heard a voice: Tuan, Tuan. I turned and in the darkness recognised\nTim's head boy. He began to speak in little frightened gasps. I listened\nto him with horror. What he told me was unspeakable. I pushed him aside\nand rushed into the house. The sitting-room was dark. I turned on the\nlight. The first thing I saw was Sally huddled up in an arm-chair. She\nwas startled by my sudden appearance and cried out. I could hardly\nspeak. I asked her if it was true. When she told me it was I felt the\nroom suddenly going round and round me. I had to sit down. As the car\nthat bore Tim and Sally drove up the road that led to the house and Tim\nsounded the claxon to announce their arrival and the boys and the amah\nran out to greet them there was the sound of a shot. They ran to Olive's\nroom and found her lying in front of the looking-glass in a pool of\nblood. She had shot herself with Tim's revolver.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Is she dead?' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No, they sent for the doctor, and he took her to the hospital.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hardly knew what I was doing. I didn't even trouble to tell Sally\nwhere I was going. I got up and staggered to the door. I got into the\ncar and told my seis to drive like hell to the hospital. I rushed in. I\nasked where she was. They tried to bar my way, but I pushed them aside.\nI knew where the private rooms were. Someone clung to my arm, but I\nshook him off. I vaguely understood that the doctor had given\ninstructions that no one was to go into the room. I didn't care about\nthat. There was an orderly at the door; he put out his arm to prevent me\nfrom passing. I swore at him and told him to get out of my way. I\nsuppose I made a row, I was beside myself; the door was opened and the\ndoctor came out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Who's making all this noise?' he said. 'Oh, it's you. What do you\nwant?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Is she dead?' I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No. But she's unconscious. She never regained consciousness. It's only\na matter of an hour or two.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I want to see her.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You can't.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I'm engaged to her.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You?' he cried, and even at that moment I was aware that he looked at\nme strangely. 'That's all the more reason.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know what he meant. I was stupid with horror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Surely you can do something to save her,' I cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He shook his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'If you saw her you wouldn't wish it,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I stared at him aghast. In the silence I heard a man's convulsive\nsobbing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Who's that?' I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Her brother.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then I felt a hand on my arm. I looked round and saw it was Mrs.\nSergison.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'My poor boy,' she said, 'I'm so sorry for you.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What on earth made her do it?' I groaned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Come away, my dear,' said Mrs. Sergison. 'You can do no good here.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'No, I must stay,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Well, go and sit in my room,' said the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was so broken that I let Mrs. Sergison take me by the arm and lead me\ninto the doctor's private room. She made me sit down. I couldn't bring\nmyself to realise that it was true. I thought it was a horrible\nnightmare from which I must awake. I don't know how long we sat there.\nThree hours. Four hours. At last the doctor came in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It's all over,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then I couldn't help myself, I began to cry. I didn't care what they\nthought of me. I was so frightfully unhappy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We buried her next day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Sergison came back to my house and sat with me for a while. She\nwanted me to go to the club with her. I hadn't the heart. She was very\nkind, but I was glad when she left me by myself. I tried to read, but\nthe words meant nothing to me. I felt dead inside. My boy came in and\nturned on the lights. My head was aching like mad. Then he came back and\nsaid that a lady wished to see me. I asked who it was. He wasn't quite\nsure, but he thought it must be the new wife of the tuan at Putatan. I\ncouldn't imagine what she wanted. I got up and went to the door. He was\nright. It was Sally. I asked her to come in. I noticed that she was\ndeathly white. I felt sorry for her. It was a frightful experience for a\ngirl of that age and for a bride a miserable homecoming. She sat down.\nShe was very nervous. I tried to put her at her ease by saying\nconventional things. She made me very uncomfortable because she stared\nat me with those enormous blue eyes of hers, and they were simply\nghastly with horror. She interrupted me suddenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You're the only person here I know,' she said. 'I had to come to you.\nI want you to get me away from here.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was dumbfounded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What <i>do</i> you mean?' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I don't want you to ask me any questions. I just want you to get me\naway. At once. I want to go back to England!'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'But you can't leave Tim like that just now,' I said. 'My dear, you\nmust pull yourself together. I know it's been awful for you. But think\nof Tim. I mean, he'll be miserable. If you have any love for him the\nleast you can do is to try and make him a little less unhappy.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Oh, you don't know,' she cried. 'I can't tell you. It's too horrible.\nI beseech you to help me. If there's a train to-night let me get on it.\nIf I can only get to Penang I can get a ship. I can't stay in this place\nanother night. I shall go mad.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was absolutely bewildered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Does Tim know?' I asked her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I haven't seen Tim since last night. I'll never see him again. I'd\nrather die.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wanted to gain a little time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'But how can you go without your things? Have you got any luggage?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What does that matter?' she cried impatiently. 'I've got what I want\nfor the journey.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Have you any money?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Enough. Is there a train to-night?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Yes,' I said. 'It's due just after midnight.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Thank God. Will you arrange everything? Can I stay here till then?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You're putting me in a frightful position,' I said. 'I don't know what\nto do for the best. You know, it's an awfully serious step you're\ntaking.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'If you knew everything you'd know it was the only possible thing to\ndo.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It'll create an awful scandal here. I don't know what people'll say.\nHave you thought of the effect on Tim?' I was worried and unhappy. 'God\nknows I don't want to interfere in what isn't my business. But if you\nwant me to help you I ought to know enough to feel justified in doing\nso. You must tell me what's happened.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I can't. I can only tell you that I know everything.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She hid her face with her hands and shuddered. Then she gave herself a\nshake as though she were recoiling from some frightful sight.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He had no right to marry me. It was monstrous.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And as she spoke her voice rose shrill and piercing. I was afraid she\nwas going to have an attack of hysterics. Her pretty doll-like face was\nterrified and her eyes stared as though she could never close them\nagain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Don't you love him any more?' I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'After that?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What will you do if I refuse to help you?' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I suppose there's a clergyman here or a doctor. You can't refuse to\ntake me to one of them.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'How did you get here?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'The head boy drove me. He got a car from somewhere.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Does Tim know you've gone?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I left a letter for him.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He'll know you're here.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'He won't try to stop me. I promise you that. He daren't. For God's\nsake don't you try either. I tell you I shall go mad if I stay here\nanother night.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I sighed. After all she was of an age to decide for herself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI, the writer of this, hadn't spoken for a long time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you know what she meant?\" I asked Featherstone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave me a long, haggard look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There was only one thing she could mean. It was unspeakable. Yes, I\nknew all right. It explained everything. Poor Olive. Poor sweet. I\nsuppose it was unreasonable of me, at that moment I only felt a horror\nof that little pretty fair-haired thing with her terrified eyes. I hated\nher. I didn't say anything for a while. Then I told her I'd do as she\nwished. She didn't even say thank you. I think she knew what I felt\nabout her. When it was dinner-time I made her eat something and then she\nasked me if there was a room she could go and lie down in till it was\ntime to go to the station. I showed her into my spare room and left her.\nI sat in the sitting-room and waited. My God, I don't think the time has\never passed so slowly for me. I thought twelve would never strike. I\nrang up the station and was told the train wouldn't be in till nearly\ntwo. At midnight she came back to the sitting-room and we sat there for\nan hour and a half. We had nothing to say to one another and we didn't\nspeak. Then I took her to the station and put her on the train.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Was there an awful scandal?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFeatherstone frowned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. I applied for short leave. After that I was moved to\nanother post. I heard that Tim had sold his estate and bought another.\nBut I didn't know where. It was a shock to me at first when I found him\nhere.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFeatherstone, getting up, went over to a table and mixed himself a\nwhisky and soda. In the silence that fell now I heard the monotonous\nchorus of the croaking frogs. And suddenly the bird that is known as the\nfever-bird, perched in a tree close to the house, began to call. First,\nthree notes in a descending, chromatic scale, then five, then four. The\nvarying notes of the scale succeeded one another with maddening\npersistence. One was compelled to listen and to count them, and because\none did not know how many there would be it tortured one's nerves.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Blast that bird,\" said Featherstone. \"That means no sleep for me\nto-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nIt was Captain Bartlett who told me of him. I do not think that many\npeople have been to Thursday Island. It is in the Torres Straits and is\nso called because it was discovered on a Thursday by Captain Cook. I\nwent there since they told me in Sydney that it was the last place God\never made. They said there was nothing to see and warned me that I\nshould probably get my throat cut. I had come up from Sydney in a\nJapanese tramp and they put me ashore in a small boat. It was the middle\nof the night and there was not a soul on the jetty. One of the sailors\nwho landed my kit told me that if I turned to the left I should\npresently come to a two-storey building and this was the hotel. The boat\npushed off and I was left alone. I do not much like being separated from\nmy luggage, but I like still less to pass the night on a jetty and sleep\non hard stones; so I shouldered a bag and set out. It was pitch dark. I\nseemed to walk much more than a few hundred yards which they had spoken\nof and was afraid I had missed my way, but at last saw dimly a building\nwhich seemed to be important enough to suggest that it might be the\nhotel. No light showed, but my eyes by now were pretty well accustomed\nto the darkness and I found a door. I struck a match, but could see no\nbell. I knocked; there was no reply; I knocked again, with my stick, as\nloudly as I could, then a window above me was opened and a woman's voice\nasked me what I wanted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've just got off the <i>Shika Maru</i>,\" I said. \"Can I have a room?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll come down.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI waited a little longer, and the door was opened by a woman in a red\nflannel dressing-gown. Her hair was hanging over her shoulders in long\nblack wisps. In her hand she held a paraffin lamp. She greeted me\nwarmly, a little stoutish woman, with keen eyes and a nose suspiciously\nred, and bade me come in. She took me upstairs and showed me a room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now you sit down,\" she said, \"and I'll make up the bed before you can\nsay Jack Robinson. What will you 'ave? A drop of whisky would do you\ngood, I should think. You won't want to be washing at this time of\nnight, I'll bring you a towel in the morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd while she made the bed she asked me who I was and what I had come to\nThursday Island for. She could see I wasn't a sea-faring man--all the\npilots came to this hotel and had done for twenty years--and she didn't\nknow what business could have brought me. I wasn't that fellow as was\ncoming to inspect the Customs, was I? She'd 'eard they were sending\nsomeone from Sydney. I asked her if there were any pilots staying there\nthen. Yes, there was one, Captain Bartlett, did I know him? A queer fish\nhe was and no mistake. Hadn't got a hair on his head, but the way he\ncould put his liquor away, well, it was a caution. There, the bed was\nready and she expected I'd sleep like a top and one thing she could say\nwas, the sheets were clean. She lit the end of a candle and bade me\ngood-night.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCaptain Bartlett certainly was a queer fish, but he is of no moment to\nmy present purpose; I made his acquaintance at dinner next day--before I\nleft Thursday Island I had eaten turtle soup so often that I have ceased\nto look upon it as a luxury--and it was because in the course of\nconversation I mentioned that I spoke French that he asked me to go and\nsee French Joe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It'll be a treat to the old fellow to talk his own lingo for a bit.\nHe's ninety-three, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor the last two years, not because he was ill but because he was old\nand destitute, he had lived in the hospital and it was here that I\nvisited him. He was lying in bed, in flannel pyjamas much too large for\nhim, a little shrivelled old man with vivacious eyes, a short white\nbeard and bushy black eyebrows. He was glad to speak French with me,\nwhich he spoke with the marked accent of his native isle, for he was a\nCorsican, but he had dwelt so many years among English-speaking people\nthat he no longer spoke his mother tongue with accuracy. He used English\nwords as though they were French, making verbs of them with French\nterminations. He talked very quickly, with broad gestures, and his voice\nfor the most part was clear and strong; but now and then it seemed\nsuddenly to fade away so that it sounded as though he spoke from the\ngrave. The hushed and hollow sound gave me an eerie feeling. Indeed I\ncould not look upon him still as of this world. His real name was Joseph\nde Paoli. He was a nobleman and a gentleman. He was of the same family\nas the general we have all read of in Boswell's Johnson, but he showed\nno interest in his famous ancestor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We have had so many generals in our family,\" he said. \"You know, of\ncourse, that Napoleon Bonaparte was a connection of mine. No, I have\nnever read Boswell. I have not read books. I have lived.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had entered the French army in 1851. Seventy-five years ago. It is\nterrifying. As a lieutenant of artillery (\"like my cousin Bonaparte,\" he\nsaid) he had fought the Russians in the Crimea and as a captain the\nPrussians in 1870. He showed me a scar on his bald pate from an Uhlan's\nlance and then with a dramatic gesture told how he had thrust his sword\nin the Uhlan's body with such violence that he could not withdraw it.\nThe Uhlan fell dead and the sword remained in the body. But the Empire\nperished and he joined the communists. For six weeks he fought against\nthe government troops under Monsieur Thiers. To me Thiers is but a\nshadowy figure, and it was startling and even a trifle comic to hear\nFrench Joe speak with passionate hatred of a man who has been dead for\nhalf a century. His voice rose into a shrill scream as he repeated the\ninsults, Oriental in their imagery, which in the council he had flung at\nthe head of this mediocre statesman. French Joe was tried and sentenced\nto five years in New Caledonia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They should have shot me,\" he said, \"but, dirty cowards, they dared\nnot.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen came the long journey in a sailing vessel, and the antipodes, and\nhis wrath flamed out again when he spoke of the indignity thrust upon\nhim, a political prisoner, when they herded him with vulgar criminals.\nThe ship put in at Melbourne and one of the officers, a fellow-Corsican,\nenabled him to slip over the side. He swam ashore and, taking his\nfriend's advice, went straight to the police-station. No one there could\nunderstand a word he said, but an interpreter was sent for, his dripping\npapers were examined and he was told that so long as he did not set foot\non a French ship he was safe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Freedom,\" he cried to me. \"Freedom.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen came a long series of adventures. He cooked, taught French, swept\nstreets, worked in the gold mines, tramped, starved, and at last found\nhis way to New Guinea. Here he underwent the most astonishing of his\nexperiences, for drifting into the savage interior, and they are\ncannibals there still, after a hundred desperate adventures and\nhair-breadth escapes he made himself king of some wild tribe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look at me, my friend,\" he said, \"I who lie here on a hospital bed, the\nobject of charity, have been monarch of all I surveyed. Yes, it is\nsomething to say that I have been a king.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut eventually he came into collision with the British and his\nsovereignty passed from him. He fled the country and started life once\nmore. It is clear that he was a fellow of resource for eventually he\ncame to own a fleet of pearling luggers on Thursday Island. It looked as\nthough at last he had reached a haven of peace and, an elderly man now,\nhe looked forward to a prosperous and even respectable old age. A\nhurricane destroyed his boats and ruin fell upon him. He never\nrecovered. He was too old to make a fresh start, and since then had\nearned as best he could a precarious livelihood till at last, beaten, he\nhad accepted the hospital's kindly shelter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But why did you not go back to France or Corsica? An amnesty was\ngranted to the communists a quarter of a century ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are France and Corsica to me after fifty years? A cousin of mine\nseized my land. We Corsicans never forget and never forgive. If I had\ngone back I should have had to kill him. He had his children.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Funny old French Joe,\" smiled the hospital nurse who stood at the end\nof the bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At all events you have had a fine life,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never. Never. I have had a frightful life. Misfortune has followed me\nwherever I turned my steps and look at me now: I am rotten, fit for\nnothing but the grave. I thank God that I had no children to inherit the\ncurse that is upon me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, Joe, I thought you didn't believe in God,\" said the nurse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is true. I am a sceptic. I have never seen a sign that there is in\nthe scheme of things an intelligent purpose. If the universe is the\ncontrivance of some being, that being can only be a criminal imbecile.\"\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"Anyhow, I have not got much longer in this\nfilthy world and then I shall go and see for myself what is the real\ntruth of the whole business.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe nurse told me it was time to leave the old man and I took his hand\nto bid him farewell. I asked him if there was anything I could do for\nhim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want nothing,\" he said. \"I only want to die.\" His black shining eyes\ntwinkled. \"But meanwhile I should be grateful for a packet of\ncigarettes.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI was in Thursday Island and I wanted very much to go to New Guinea. Now\nthe only way in which I could do this was by getting a pearling lugger\nto take me across the Arafura Sea. The pearl fishery at that time was in\na bad way and a flock of neat little craft lay anchored in the harbour.\nI found a skipper with nothing much to do (the journey to Merauke and\nback could hardly take him less than a month) and with him I made the\nnecessary arrangements. He engaged four Torres Straits islanders as crew\n(the boat was but nineteen tons) and we ransacked the local store for\ncanned goods. A day or two before I sailed a man who owned a number of\npearlers came to me and asked whether on my way I would stop at the\nisland of Trebucket and leave a sack of flour, another of rice, and some\nmagazines for the hermit who lived there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI pricked up my ears. It appeared that the hermit had lived by himself\non this remote and tiny island for thirty years, and when opportunity\noccurred provisions were sent to him by kindly souls. He said that he\nwas a Dane, but in the Torres Straits he was known as German Harry. His\nhistory went back a long way. Thirty years before, he had been an able\nseaman on a sailing vessel that was wrecked in those treacherous waters.\nTwo boats managed to get away and eventually hit upon the desert island\nof Trebucket. This is well out of the line of traffic and it was three\nyears before any ship sighted the castaways. Sixteen men had landed on\nthe island, but when at last a schooner, driven from her course by\nstress of weather, put in for shelter, no more than five were left. When\nthe storm abated the skipper took four of these on board and eventually\nlanded them at Sydney. German Harry refused to go with them. He said\nthat during those three years he had seen such terrible things that he\nhad a horror of his fellow-men and wished never to live with them again.\nHe would say no more. He was absolutely fixed in his determination to\nstay, entirely by himself, in that lonely place. Though now and then\nopportunity had been given him to leave he had never taken it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA strange man and a strange story. I learned more about him as we sailed\nacross the desolate sea. The Torres Straits are peppered with islands\nand at night we anchored on the lee of one or other of them. Of late new\npearling grounds have been discovered near Trebucket and in the autumn\npearlers, visiting it now and then, have given German Harry various\nnecessities so that he has been able to make himself sufficiently\ncomfortable. They bring him papers, bags of flour and rice, and canned\nmeats. He has a whale boat and used to go fishing in it, but now he is\nno longer strong enough to manage its unwieldy bulk. There is abundant\npearl shell on the reef that surrounds his island and this he used to\ncollect and sell to the pearlers for tobacco, and sometimes he found a\ngood pearl for which he got a considerable sum. It is believed that he\nhas, hidden away somewhere, a collection of magnificent pearls. During\nthe war no pearlers came out and for years he never saw a living soul.\nFor all he knew, a terrible epidemic had killed off the entire human\nrace and he was the only man alive. He was asked later what he thought.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought something had happened,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe ran out of matches and was afraid that his fire would go out, so he\nonly slept in snatches, putting wood on his fire from time to time all\nday and all night. He came to the end of his provisions and lived on\nchickens, fish and coconuts. Sometimes he got a turtle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDuring the last four months of the year there may be two or three\npearlers about and not infrequently after the day's work they will row\nin and spend an evening with him. They try to make him drunk and then\nthey ask him what happened during those three years after the two\nboat-loads came to the island. How was it that sixteen landed and at the\nend of that time only five were left? He never says a word. Drunk or\nsober he is equally silent on that subject and if they insist grows\nangry and leaves them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI forget if it was four or five days before we sighted the hermit's\nlittle kingdom. We had been driven by bad weather to take shelter and\nhad spent a couple of days at an island on the way. Trebucket is a low\nisland, perhaps a mile round, covered with coconuts, just raised above\nthe level of the sea and surrounded by a reef so that it can be\napproached only on one side. There is no opening in the reef and the\nlugger had to anchor a mile from the shore. We got into a dinghy with\nthe provisions. It was a stiff pull and even within the reef the sea was\nchoppy. I saw the little hut, sheltered by trees, in which German Harry\nlived, and as we approached he sauntered down slowly to the water's\nedge. We shouted a greeting, but he did not answer. He was a man of over\nseventy, very bald, hatchet-faced, with a grey beard, and he walked with\na roll so that you could never have taken him for anything but a\nsea-faring man. His sunburn made his blue eyes look very pale and they\nwere surrounded by wrinkles as though for long years he had spent\ninterminable hours scanning the vacant sea. He wore dungarees and a\nsinglet, patched, but neat and clean. The house to which he presently\nled us consisted of a single room with a roof of corrugated iron. There\nwas a bed in it, some rough stools which he himself had made, a table,\nand his various household utensils. Under a tree in front of it was a\ntable and a bench. Behind was an enclosed run for his chickens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI cannot say that he was pleased to see us. He accepted our gifts as a\nright, without thanks, and grumbled a little because something or other\nhe needed had not been brought. He was silent and morose. He was not\ninterested in the news we had to give him, for the outside world was no\nconcern of his: the only thing he cared about was his island. He looked\nupon it with a jealous, proprietary right; he called it \"my health\nresort\" and he feared that the coconuts that covered it would tempt some\nenterprising trader. He looked at me with suspicion. He was sombrely\ncurious to know what I was doing in these seas. He used words with\ndifficulty, talking to himself rather than to us, and it was a little\nuncanny to hear him mumble away as though we were not there. But he was\nmoved when my skipper told him that an old man of his own age whom he\nhad known for a long time was dead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Old Charlie dead--that's too bad. Old Charlie dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe repeated it over and over again. I asked him if he read.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not much,\" he answered indifferently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe seemed to be occupied with nothing but his food, his dogs and his\nchickens. If what they tell us in books were true his long communion\nwith nature and the sea should have taught him many subtle secrets. It\nhadn't. He was a savage. He was nothing but a narrow, ignorant and\ncantankerous sea-faring man. As I looked at the wrinkled, mean old face\nI wondered what was the story of those three dreadful years that had\nmade him welcome this long imprisonment. I sought to see behind those\npale blue eyes of his what secrets they were that he would carry to his\ngrave. And then I foresaw the end. One day a pearl fisher would land on\nthe island and German Harry would not be waiting for him, silent and\nsuspicious, at the water's edge. He would go up to the hut and there,\nlying on the bed, unrecognisable, he would see all that remained of what\nhad once been a man. Perhaps then he would hunt high and low for the\ngreat mass of pearls that has haunted the fancy of so many adventurers.\nBut I do not believe he would find it: German Harry would have seen to\nit that none should discover the treasure, and the pearls would rot in\ntheir hiding place. Then the pearl fisher would go back into his dinghy\nand the island once more be deserted of man.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThe Van Dorth Hotel at Singapore was far from grand. The bedrooms were\ndingy and the mosquito nets patched and darned; the bath-houses, all in\na row and detached from the bedrooms, were dank and smelly. But it had\ncharacter. The people who stayed there, masters of tramps whose round\nended at Singapore, mining engineers out of a job and planters taking a\nholiday, to my mind bore a more romantic air than the smart folk,\nglobe-trotters, government officials and their wives, wealthy merchants,\nwho gave luncheon-parties at the Europe and played golf and danced and\nwere fashionable. The Van Dorth had a billiard-room, with a table with a\nthreadbare cloth, where ships' engineers and clerks in insurance offices\nplayed snooker. The dining-room was large and bare and silent. Dutch\nfamilies on the way to Sumatra ate solidly through their dinner without\nexchanging a word with one another, and single gentlemen on a business\ntrip from Batavia devoured a copious meal while they intently read their\npaper. On two days a week there was rijstafel and then a few residents\nof Singapore who had a fancy for this dish came for tiffin. The Van\nDorth Hotel should have been a depressing place, but somehow it wasn't;\nits quaintness saved it. It had a faint aroma of something strange and\nhalf-forgotten. There was a scrap of garden facing the street where you\ncould sit in the shade of trees and drink cold beer. In that crowded and\nbusy city, though motors whizzed past and rickshaws passed continuously,\nthe coolies' feet pattering on the road and their bells ringing, it had\nthe remote peacefulness of a corner of Holland. It was the third time I\nhad stayed at the Van Dorth. I had been told about it first by the\nskipper of a Dutch tramp, the S.S. <i>Utrecht</i>, on which I had travelled\nfrom Merauke in New Guinea to Macassar. The journey took the best part\nof a month, since the ship stopped at a number of islands in the Malay\nArchipelago, the Aru and the Kei Islands, Banda-Neira, Amboina and\nothers of which I have even forgotten the names, sometimes for an hour\nor two, sometimes for a day, to take on or discharge cargo. It was a\ncharming, monotonous and diverting trip. When we dropped anchor the\nagent came out in his launch, and generally the Dutch Resident, and we\ngathered on deck under the awning and the captain ordered beer. The news\nof the island was exchanged for the news of the world. We brought papers\nand mail. If we were staying long enough the Resident asked us to dinner\nand, leaving the ship in charge of the second officer, we all (the\ncaptain, the chief officer, the engineer, the supercargo and I) piled\ninto the launch and went ashore. We spent a merry evening. These little\nislands, one so like another, allured my fancy just because I knew that\nI should never see them again. It made them strangely unreal, and as we\nsailed away and they vanished into the sea and sky it was only by an\neffort of the imagination that I could persuade myself that they did not\nwith my last glimpse of them cease to exist.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut there was nothing illusive, mysterious or fantastic about the\ncaptain, the chief officer, the chief engineer and the supercargo. Their\nsolidity was amazing. They were the four fattest men I ever saw. At\nfirst I had great difficulty in telling them apart, for though one, the\nsupercargo, was dark and the others were fair, they looked astonishingly\nalike. They were all big, with large round bare red faces, with large\nfat arms and large fat legs and large fat bellies. When they went ashore\nthey buttoned up their stengah-shifters and then their great double\nchins bulged over the collars and they looked as though they would\nchoke. But generally they wore them unbuttoned. They sweated freely and\nwiped their shiny faces with bandanas and vigorously fanned themselves\nwith palm-leaf fans.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a treat to see them at tiffin. Their appetites were enormous.\nThey had rijstafel every day, and each seemed to vie with the other how\nhigh he could pile his plate. They loved it hot and strong.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In dis country you can't eat a ting onless it's tasty,\" said the\nskipper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"De only way to keep yourself up in dis country is to eat hearty,\" said\nthe chief.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were the greatest friends, all four of them; they were like\nschoolboys together, playing absurd little pranks with one another. They\nknew each other's jokes by heart and no sooner did one of them start the\nfamiliar lines than he would splutter with laughter so violently, the\nheavy shaking laughter of the fat man, that he could not go on, and then\nthe others began to laugh too. They rolled about in their chairs, and\ngrew redder and redder, hotter and hotter, till the skipper shouted for\nbeer, and each, gasping but happy, drank his bottle in one enchanted\ndraught. They had been on this run together for five years and when, a\nlittle time before, the chief officer had been offered a ship of his own\nhe refused it. He would not leave his companions. They had made up their\nminds that when the first of them retired they would all retire.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All friends and a good ship. Good grub and good beer. Vot can a\nsensible man vant more?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt first they were a little stand-offish with me. Although the ship had\naccommodation for half a dozen passengers, they did not often get any,\nand never one whom they did not know. I was a stranger and a foreigner.\nThey liked their bit of fun and did not want anyone to interfere with\nit. But they were all of them very fond of bridge, and on occasion the\nchief and the engineer had duties that prevented one or the other from\nplaying. They were willing to put up with me when they discovered that I\nwas ready to make a fourth whenever I was wanted. Their bridge was as\nincredibly fantastic as they were. They played for infinitesimal stakes,\nfive cents a hundred: they did not want to win one another's money, they\nsaid, it was the game they liked. But what a game! Each was wildly\ndetermined to play the hand and hardly one was dealt without at least a\nsmall slam being declared. The rule was that if you could get a peep at\nsomebody else's cards you did and if you could get away with a revoke\nyou told your partner when there was no danger it could be claimed and\nyou both roared with laughter till the tears rolled down your fat\ncheeks. But if your partner had insisted on taking the bid away from you\nand had called a grand slam on five spades to the queen, whereas you\nwere positive on your seven little diamonds you could have made it\neasily, you could always score him off by redoubling without a trick in\nyour hand. He went down two or three thousand and the glasses on the\ntable danced with the laughter that shook your opponents.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI could never remember their difficult Dutch names, but knowing them\nanonymously as it were, only by the duties they performed, as one knows\nthe characters Pantaloon, Harlequin and Punchinello, of the old Italian\ncomedy, added grotesquely to their drollery. The mere sight of them, all\nfour together, set you laughing, and I think they got a good deal of\namusement from the astonishment they caused in strangers. They boasted\nthat they were the four most famous Dutchmen in the East Indies. To me\nnot the least comic part of them was their serious side. Sometimes late\nat night, when they had given up all pretence of still wearing their\nuniforms, and one or the other of them lay by my side on a long chair in\na pyjama-jacket and a sarong, he would grow sentimental. The chief\nengineer, due to retire soon, was meditating marriage with a widow whom\nhe had met when last he was home and spending the rest of his life in a\nlittle town with old red-brick houses on the shores of the Zuyder Zee.\nBut the captain was very susceptible to the charms of the native girls\nand his thick English became almost unintelligible from emotion when he\ndescribed to me the effect they had on him. One of these days he would\nbuy himself a house on the hills in Java and marry a pretty little\nJavanese. They were so small and so gentle and they made no noise, and\nhe would dress her in silk sarongs and give her gold chains to wear\nround her neck and gold bangles to put on her arms. But the chief mocked\nhim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Silly all dat is. Silly. She goes mit all your friends and de\nhouse-boys and everybody. By de time you retire, my dear, vot you'll\nvant vill be a nurse, not a vife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Me?\" cried the skipper. \"I shall want a vife ven I'm eighty!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had picked up a little thing last time the ship was at Macassar and\nas we approached that port he began to be all of a flutter. The chief\nofficer shrugged fat and indulgent shoulders. The captain was always\nlosing his head over one brazen hussy after another, but his passion\nnever survived the interval between one stop at a port and the next, and\nthen the chief was called in to smooth out the difficulties that ensued.\nAnd so it would be this time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"De old man suffers from fatty degeneration of de heart. But so long as\nI'm dere to look after him not much harm comes of it. He vastes his\nmoney and dat's a pity, but as long as he's got it to vaste, why\nshouldn't he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe chief officer had a philosophic soul.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt Macassar then I disembarked, and bade farewell to my four fat\nfriends.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Make another journey with us,\" they said. \"Come back next year or the\nyear after. You'll find us all here just the same as ever.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA good many months had passed since then and I had wandered through more\nthan one strange land. I had been to Bali and Java and Sumatra; I had\nbeen to Cambodia and Annam; and now, feeling as though I were home\nagain, I sat in the garden of the Van Dorth Hotel. It was cool in the\nvery early morning and having had breakfast I was looking at back\nnumbers of the <i>Straits Times</i> to find out what had been happening in\nthe world since last I had been within reach of papers. Nothing very\nmuch. Suddenly my eyes caught a headline: <i>The</i> Utrecht <i>Tragedy</i>.\n<i>Supercargo and Chief Engineer. Not Guilty.</i> I read the paragraph\ncarelessly and then I sat up. The <i>Utrecht</i> was the ship of my four fat\nDutchmen and apparently the supercargo and the chief engineer had been\non trial for murder. It couldn't be my two fat friends. The names were\ngiven, but the names meant nothing to me. The trial had taken place in\nBatavia. No details were given in this paragraph; it was only a brief\nannouncement that after the judges had considered the speeches of the\nprosecution and of the defence their verdict was as stated. I was\nastounded. It was incredible that the men I knew could have committed a\nmurder. I could not find out who had been murdered. I looked through\nback numbers of the paper. Nothing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI got up and went to the manager of the hotel, a genial Dutchman, who\nspoke admirable English, and showed him the paragraph.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's the ship I sailed on. I was in her for nearly a month. Surely\nthese fellows aren't the men I knew. The men I knew were enormously\nfat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, that's right,\" he answered. \"They were celebrated all through the\nDutch East Indies, the four fattest men in the service. It's been a\nterrible thing. It made a great sensation. And they were friends. I knew\nthem all. The best fellows in the world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what happened?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe told me the story and answered my horrified questions. But there were\nthings I wanted to know that he couldn't tell me. It was all confused.\nIt was unbelievable. What actually had happened was only conjecture.\nThen someone claimed the manager's attention and I went back to the\ngarden. It was getting hot now and I went up to my room. I was strangely\nshattered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt appeared that on one of the trips the captain took with him a Malay\ngirl that he had been carrying on with and I wondered if it was the one\nhe had been so eager to see when I was on board. The other three had\nbeen against her coming--what did they want with a woman in the ship? it\nwould spoil everything--but the captain insisted and she came. I think\nthey were all jealous of her. On that journey they didn't have the fun\nthey generally had. When they wanted to play bridge the skipper was\ndallying with the girl in his cabin; when they touched at a port and\nwent ashore the time seemed long to him till he could get back to her.\nHe was crazy about her. It was the end of all their larks. The chief\nofficer was more bitter against her than anybody: he was the captain's\nparticular chum, they had been shipmates ever since they first came out\nfrom Holland; more than once high words passed between them on the\nsubject of the captain's infatuation. Presently those old friends spoke\nto one another only when their duties demanded it. It was the end of the\ngood fellowship that had so long obtained between the four fat men.\nThings went from bad to worse. There was a feeling among the junior\nofficers that something untoward was pending. Uneasiness. Tension. Then\none night the ship was aroused by the sound of a shot and the screams of\nthe Malay girl. The supercargo and the chief engineer tumbled out of\ntheir bunks and they found the captain, a revolver in his hand, at the\ndoor of the chief officer's cabin. He pushed past them and went on deck.\nThey entered and found the chief officer dead and the girl cowering\nbehind the door. The captain had found them in bed together and had\nkilled the chief. How he had discovered what was going on didn't seem to\nbe known, nor what was the meaning of the intrigue. Had the chief\ninduced the girl to come to his cabin in order to get back on the\ncaptain, or had she, knowing his ill-will and anxious to placate him,\nlured him to become her lover? It was a mystery that would never be\nsolved. A dozen possible explanations flashed across my mind. While the\nengineer and the supercargo were in the cabin, horror-struck at the\nsight before them, another shot was heard. They knew at once what had\nhappened. They rushed up the companion. The captain had gone to his\ncabin and blown his brains out. Then the story grew dark and enigmatic.\nNext morning the Malay girl was nowhere to be found and when the second\nofficer, who had taken command of the ship, reported this to the\nsupercargo, the supercargo said: \"She's probably jumped overboard. It's\nthe best thing she could have done. Good riddance to bad rubbish.\" But\none of the sailors on the watch, just before dawn, had seen the\nsupercargo and the chief engineer carry something up on deck, a bulky\npackage, about the size of a native woman, look about them to see that\nthey were unobserved, and drop it overboard; and it was said all over\nthe ship that these two to avenge their friends had sought the girl out\nin her cabin and strangled her and flung her body into the sea. When the\nship arrived at Macassar they were arrested and taken to Batavia to be\ntried for murder. The evidence was flimsy and they were acquitted. But\nall through the East Indies they knew that the supercargo and the chief\nengineer had executed justice on the trollop who had caused the death of\nthe two men they loved.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd thus ended the comic and celebrated friendship of the four fat\nDutchmen.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Moon was sitting in his office. His work was finished, and he\nlingered there because he hadn't the heart to go down to the club. It\nwas getting on towards tiffin time, and there would be a good many\nfellows hanging about the bar. Two or three of them would offer him a\ndrink. He could not face their heartiness. Some he had known for thirty\nyears. They had bored him, and on the whole he disliked them, but now\nthat he was seeing them for the last time it gave him a pang. To-night\nthey were giving him a farewell dinner. Everyone would be there and they\nwere presenting him with a silver tea-service that he did not in the\nleast want. They would make speeches in which they would refer\neulogistically to his work in the colony, express their regret at his\ndeparture and wish him long life to enjoy his well-earned leisure. He\nwould reply suitably. He had prepared a speech in which he surveyed the\nchanges that had taken place in the F.M.S. since first, a raw cadet, he\nhad landed at Singapore. He would thank them for their loyal\nco-operation with him during the term which it had been his privilege to\nserve as Resident at Timbang Belud, and draw a glowing picture of the\nfuture that awaited the country as a whole and Timbang Belud in\nparticular. He would remind them that he had known it as a\npoverty-stricken village with a few Chinese shops and left it now a\nprosperous town with paved streets down which ran trams, with stone\nhouses, a rich Chinese settlement and a club-house second in splendour\nonly to that of Singapore. They would sing \"For he's a jolly good\nfellow\" and \"Auld Lang Syne\". Then they would dance and a good many of\nthe younger men would get drunk. The Malays had already given him a\nfarewell party and the Chinese an interminable feast. To-morrow a vast\nconcourse would see him off at the station and that would be the end of\nhim. He wondered what they would say of him. The Malays and the Chinese\nwould say that he had been stern, but acknowledge that he had been just.\nThe planters had not liked him. They thought him hard because he would\nnot let them ride roughshod over their labour. His subordinates had\nfeared him. He drove them. He had no patience with slackness or\ninefficiency. He had never spared himself and saw no reason why he\nshould spare others. They thought him inhuman. It was true that there\nwas nothing come-hither in him. He could not throw off his official\nposition when he went to the club and laugh at bawdy stories, chaff and\nbe chaffed. He was conscious that his arrival cast a gloom, and to play\nbridge with him (he liked to play every day from six to eight) was\nlooked upon as a privilege rather than an entertainment. When at some\nother table a young man's four as the evening wore on grew hilarious, he\ncaught glances thrown in his direction and sometimes an older member\nwould stroll up to the noisy ones and in an undertone advise them to be\nquiet. George Moon sighed a little. From an official standpoint his\ncareer had been a success, he had been the youngest Resident ever\nappointed in the F.M.S., and for exceptional services a C.M.G. had been\nconferred upon him; but from the human it had perhaps been otherwise. He\nhad earned respect, respect for his ability, industry and\ntrustworthiness, but he was too clear-sighted to think for a moment that\nhe had inspired affection. No one would regret him. In a few months he\nwould be forgotten.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe smiled grimly. He was not sentimental. He had enjoyed his authority,\nand it gave him an austere satisfaction to know that he had kept\neveryone up to the mark. It did not displease him to think that he had\nbeen feared rather than loved. He saw his life as a problem in higher\nmathematics, the working-out of which had required intense application\nof all his powers, but of which the result had not the least practical\nconsequence. Its interest lay in its intricacy and its beauty in its\nsolution. But like pure beauty it led nowhither. His future was blank.\nHe was fifty-five, and full of energy, and to himself his mind seemed as\nalert as ever, his experience of men and affairs was wide: all that\nremained to him was to settle down in a country town in England or in a\ncheap part of the Riviera and play bridge with elderly ladies and golf\nwith retired colonels. He had met, when on leave, old chiefs of his, and\nhad observed with what difficulty they adapted themselves to the change\nin their circumstances. They had looked forward to the freedom that\nwould be theirs when they retired and had pictured the charming uses to\nwhich they would put their leisure. Mirage. It was not very pleasant to\nbe obscure after having dwelt in a spacious Residency, to make do with a\ncouple of maids when you had been accustomed to the service of half a\ndozen Chinese boys and, above all, it was not pleasant to realise that\nyou did not matter a row of beans to anyone when you had grown used to\nthe delicate flattery of knowing that a word of praise could delight and\na frown humiliate all sorts and conditions of men.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Moon stretched out his hand and helped himself to a cigarette\nfrom the box on his desk. As he did so he noticed all the little lines\non the back of his hand and the thinness of his shrivelled fingers. He\nfrowned with distaste. It was the hand of an old man. There was in his\noffice a Chinese mirror-picture that he had bought long ago and that he\nwas leaving behind. He got up and looked at himself in it. He saw a thin\nyellow face, wrinkled and tight-lipped, thin grey hair and grey tired\neyes. He was tallish, very spare, with narrow shoulders, and he held\nhimself erect. He had always played polo and even now could beat most of\nthe younger men at tennis. When you talked to him he kept his eyes fixed\non your face, listening attentively, but his expression did not change,\nand you had no notion what effect your words had on him. Perhaps he did\nnot realise how disconcerting this was. He seldom smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAn orderly came in with a name written on a chit. George Moon looked at\nit and told him to show the visitor in. He sat down once more in his\nchair and looked with his cold eyes at the door through which in a\nmoment the visitor would come. It was Tom Saffary, and he wondered what\nhe wanted. Presumably something to do with the festivity that night. It\nhad amused him to hear that Tom Saffary was the head of the committee\nthat had organised it, for their relations during the last year had been\nfar from cordial. Saffary was a planter and one of his Tamil overseers\nhad lodged a complaint against him for assault. The Tamil had been\ngrossly insolent to him and Saffary had given him a thrashing. George\nMoon realised that the provocation was great, but he had always set his\nface against the planters taking the law in their own hands, and when\nthe case was tried he sentenced Saffary to a fine. But when the court\nrose, to show that there was no ill-feeling he asked Saffary to\nluncheon: Saffary, resentful of what he thought an unmerited affront,\ncurtly refused and since then had declined to have any social relations\nwith the Resident. He answered when George Moon, casually, but resolved\nnot to be affronted, spoke to him; but would neither play bridge nor\ntennis with him. He was manager of the largest rubber estate in the\ndistrict, and George Moon asked himself sardonically whether he had\narranged the dinner and collected subscriptions for the presentation\nbecause he thought his dignity required it or whether, now that his\nResident was leaving, it appealed to his sentimentality to make a noble\ngesture. It tickled George Moon's frigid sense of humour to think that\nit would fall to Tom Saffary to make the principal speech of the\nevening, in which he would enlarge upon the departing Resident's\nadmirable qualities and voice the community's regret at their\nirreparable loss.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTom Saffary was ushered in. The Resident rose from his chair, shook\nhands with him and thinly smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How do you do? Sit down. Won't you have a cigarette?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How do you do?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSaffary took the chair to which the Resident motioned him, and the\nResident waited for him to state his business. He had a notion that his\nvisitor was embarrassed. He was a big, burly, stout fellow, with a red\nface and a double chin, curly black hair and blue eyes. He was a fine\nfigure of a man, strong as a horse, but it was plain that he did himself\ntoo well. He drank a good deal and ate too heartily. But he was a good\nbusiness man and a hard worker. He ran his estate efficiently. He was\npopular in the community. He was generally known as a good chap. He was\nfree with his money and ready to lend a helping hand to anyone in\ndistress. It occurred to the Resident that Saffary had come in order\nbefore the dinner to compose the difference between them. The emotion\nthat might have occasioned such a desire excited in the Resident's\nsensibility a very faint, good-humoured contempt. He had no enemies\nbecause individuals did not mean enough to him for him to hate any of\nthem, but if he had, he thought, he would have hated them to the end.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say you're a bit surprised to see me here this morning, and I\nexpect, as it's your last day and all that, you're pretty busy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Moon did not answer, and the other went on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've come on rather an awkward business. The fact is that my wife and I\nwon't be able to come to the dinner to-night, and after that\nunpleasantness we had together last year I thought it only right to come\nand tell you that it has nothing to do with that. I think you treated me\nvery harshly; it's not the money I minded, it was the indignity, but\nbygones are bygones. Now that you're leaving I don't want you to think\nthat I bear any more ill-feeling towards you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I realised that when I heard that you were chiefly responsible for the\nsend-off you're giving me,\" answered the Resident civilly. \"I'm sorry\nthat you won't be able to come to-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry, too. It's on account of Knobby Clarke's death.\" Saffary\nhesitated for a moment. \"My wife and I were very much upset by it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was very sad. He was a great friend of yours, wasn't he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was the greatest friend I had in the colony.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTears shone in Tom Saffary's eyes. Fat men are very emotional, thought\nGeorge Moon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I quite understand that in that case you should have no heart for what\nlooks like being a rather uproarious party,\" he said kindly. \"Have you\nheard anything of the circumstances?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, nothing but what appeared in the paper.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He seemed all right when he left here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As far as I know he'd never had a day's illness in his life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Heart, I suppose. How old was he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Same age as me. Thirty-eight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's young to die.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nKnobby Clarke was a planter and the estate he managed was next door to\nSaffary's. George Moon had liked him. He was a rather ugly man, sandy,\nwith high cheek-bones and hollow temples, large pale eyes in deep\nsockets and a big mouth. But he had an attractive smile and an easy\nmanner. He was amusing and could tell a good story. He had a careless\ngood-humour that people found pleasing. He played games well. He was no\nfool. George Moon would have said he was somewhat colourless. In the\ncourse of his career he had known a good many men like him. They came\nand went. A fortnight before, he had left for England on leave and the\nResident knew that the Saffarys had given a large dinner-party on his\nlast night. He was married and his wife of course went with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry for her,\" said George Moon. \"It must have been a terrible\nblow. He was buried at sea, wasn't he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. That's what it said in the paper.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe news had reached Timbang the night before. The Singapore papers\narrived at six, just as people were getting to the club, and a good many\nmen waited to play bridge or billiards till they had had a glance at\nthem. Suddenly one fellow had called out:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, do you see this? Knobby's dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Knobby who? Not Knobby Clarke?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a three-line paragraph in a column of general intelligence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Messrs. Star, Mosley & Co. have received a cable informing them that\nMr. Harold Clarke of Timbang Batu died suddenly on his way home and was\nburied at sea.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA man came up and took the paper from the speaker's hand, and\nincredulously read the note for himself. Another peered over his\nshoulder. Such as happened to be reading the paper turned to the page in\nquestion and read the three indifferent lines.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By George,\" cried one.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, what tough luck,\" said another.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was as fit as a fiddle when he left here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA shiver of dismay pierced those hearty, jovial, careless men, and each\none for a moment remembered that he too was mortal. Other members came\nin and as they entered, braced by the thought of the six o'clock drink,\nand eager to meet their friends, they were met by the grim tidings.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, have you heard? Poor Knobby Clarke's dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No? I say, how awful!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Rotten luck, isn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Rotten.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Damned good sort.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One of the best.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It gave me quite a turn when I saw it in the paper just by chance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't wonder.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne man with the paper in his hand went into the billiard-room to break\nthe news. They were playing off the handicap for the Prince of Wales's\nCup. That august personage had presented it to the club on the occasion\nof his visit to Timbang Belud. Tom Saffary was playing against a man\ncalled Douglas, and the Resident, who had been beaten in the previous\nround, was seated with about a dozen others watching the game. The\nmarker was monotonously calling out the score. The newcomer waited for\nSaffary to finish his break and then called out to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, Tom, Knobby's dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Knobby? It's not true.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe other handed him the paper. Three or four gathered round to read\nwith him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good God!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a moment's awed silence. The paper was passed from hand to\nhand. It was odd that none seemed willing to believe till he saw it for\nhimself in black and white.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I am sorry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, it's awful for his wife,\" said Tom Saffary. \"She was going to\nhave a baby. My poor missus'll be upset.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, it's only a fortnight since he left here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was all right then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In the pink.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSaffary, his fat red face sagging a little, went over to a table and,\nseizing his glass, drank deeply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, Tom,\" said his opponent, \"would you like to call the game\noff?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can't very well do that.\" Saffary's eye sought the score board and he\nsaw that he was ahead. \"No, let's finish. Then I'll go home and break it\nto Violet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDouglas had his shot and made fourteen. Tom Saffary missed an easy\nin-off, but left nothing. Douglas played again, but did not score and\nagain Saffary missed a shot that ordinarily he could have been sure of.\nHe frowned a little. He knew his friends had betted on him pretty\nheavily and he did not like the idea of failing them. Douglas made\ntwenty-two. Saffary emptied his glass and by an effort of will that was\nquite patent to the sympathetic onlookers settled down to concentrate on\nthe game. He made a break of eighteen and when he just failed to do a\nlong Jenny they gave him a round of applause. He was sure of himself now\nand began to score quickly. Douglas was playing well too, and the match\ngrew exciting to watch. The few minutes during which Saffary's attention\nwandered had allowed his opponent to catch up with him, and now it was\nanybody's game.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Spot two hundred and thirty-five,\" called the Malay, in his queer\nclipped English. \"Plain two hundred and twenty-eight. Spot to play.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDouglas made eight, and then Saffary, who was plain, drew up to two\nhundred and forty. He left his opponent a double balk. Douglas hit\nneither ball, and so gave Saffary another point.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Spot two hundred and forty-three,\" called the marker. \"Plain two\nhundred and forty-one. Plain to play.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSaffary played three beautiful shots off the red and finished the game.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A popular victory,\" the bystanders cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Congratulations, old man,\" said Douglas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Boy,\" called Saffary, \"ask these gentlemen what they'll have. Poor old\nKnobby.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sighed heavily. The drinks were brought and Saffary signed the chit.\nThen he said he'd be getting along. Two others had already begun to\nplay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sporting of him to go on like that,\" said someone when the door was\nclosed on Saffary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, it shows grit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For a while I thought his game had gone all to pieces.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He pulled himself together in grand style. He knew there were a lot of\nbets on him. He didn't want to let his backers down.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course it's a shock, a thing like that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They were great pals. I wonder what he died of.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good shot, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Moon, remembering this scene, thought it strange that Tom\nSaffary, who on hearing of his friend's death had shown such\nself-control, should now apparently take it so hard. It might be that\njust as in the war a man when hit often did not know it till some time\nafterwards, Saffary had not realised how great a blow to him Harold\nClarke's death was till he had had time to think it over. It seemed to\nhim, however, more probable that Saffary, left to himself, would have\ncarried on as usual, seeking sympathy for his loss in the company of his\nfellows, but that his wife's conventional sense of propriety had\ninsisted that it would be bad form to go to a party when the grief they\nwere suffering from made it only decent for them to eschew for a little\nfestive gatherings. Violet Saffary was a nice little woman, three or\nfour years younger than her husband; not very pretty, but pleasant to\nlook at and always becomingly dressed; amiable, ladylike and unassuming.\nIn the days when he had been on friendly terms with the Saffarys the\nResident had from time to time dined with them. He had found her\nagreeable, but not very amusing. They had never talked but of\ncommonplace things. Of late he had seen little of her. When they chanced\nto meet she always gave him a friendly smile, and on occasion he said\none or two civil words to her. But it was only by an effort of memory\nthat he distinguished her from half a dozen of the other ladies in the\ncommunity whom his official position brought him in contact with.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSaffary had presumably said what he had come to say and the Resident\nwondered why he did not get up and go. He sat heaped up in his chair\noddly, so that it gave you the feeling that his skeleton had ceased to\nsupport him and his considerable mass of flesh was falling in on him. He\nlooked dully at the desk that separated him from the Resident. He sighed\ndeeply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must try not to take it too hard, Saffary,\" said George Moon. \"You\nknow how uncertain life is in the East. One has to resign oneself to\nlosing people one's fond of.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSaffary's eyes slowly moved from the desk, and he fixed them on George\nMoon's. They stared unwinking. George Moon liked people to look him in\nthe eyes. Perhaps he felt that when he thus held their vision he held\nthem in his power. Presently two tears formed themselves in Saffary's\nblue eyes and slowly ran down his cheeks. He had a strangely puzzled\nlook. Something had frightened him. Was it death? No. Something that he\nthought worse. He looked cowed. His mien was cringing so that he made\nyou think of a dog unjustly beaten.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not that,\" he faltered. \"I could have borne that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Moon did not answer. He held that big, powerful man with his cold\nlevel gaze and waited. He was pleasantly conscious of his absolute\nindifference. Saffary gave a harassed glance at the papers on the desk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I'm taking up too much of your time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I have nothing to do at the moment.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSaffary looked out of the window. A little shudder passed between his\nshoulders. He seemed to hesitate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder if I might ask your advice,\" he said at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course,\" said the Resident, with the shadow of a smile, \"that's one\nof the things I'm here for.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a purely private matter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You may be quite sure that I shan't betray any confidence you place in\nme.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I know you wouldn't do that, but it's rather an awkward thing to\nspeak about, and I shouldn't feel very comfortable meeting you\nafterwards. But you're going away to-morrow, and that makes it easier,\nif you understand what I mean.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSaffary began to speak, in a low voice, sulkily, as though he were\nashamed, and he spoke with the awkwardness of a man unused to words. He\nwent back and said the same thing over again. He got mixed up. He\nstarted a long, elaborate sentence and then broke off abruptly because\nhe did not know how to finish it. George Moon listened in silence, his\nface a mask, smoking, and he only took his eyes off Saffary's face to\nreach for another cigarette from the box in front of him and light it\nfrom the stub of that which he was just finishing. And while he listened\nhe saw, as it were a background, the monotonous round of the planter's\nlife. It was like an accompaniment of muted strings that threw into\nsharper relief the calculated dissonances of an unexpected melody.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith rubber at so low a price every economy had to be exercised and Tom\nSaffary, notwithstanding the size of the estate, had to do work which in\nbetter times he had had an assistant for. He rose before dawn and went\ndown to the lines where the coolies were assembled. When there was just\nenough light to see he read out the names, ticking them off according to\nthe answers, and assigned the various squads to their work. Some tapped,\nsome weeded, and others tended the ditches. Saffary went back to his\nsolid breakfast, lit his pipe and sallied forth again to inspect the\ncoolies' quarters. Children were playing and babies sprawling here and\nthere. On the sidewalks Tamil women cooked their rice. Their black skins\nshone with oil. They were draped about in dull red cotton and wore gold\nornaments in their hair. There were handsome creatures among them,\nupright of carriage, with delicate features and small, exquisite hands;\nbut Saffary looked upon them only with distaste. He set out on his\nrounds. On his well-grown estate the trees planted in rows gave one a\ncharming feeling of the prim forest of a German fairy-tale. The ground\nwas thick with dead leaves. He was accompanied by a Tamil overseer, his\nlong black hair done in a chignon, barefooted, in sarong and baju, with\na showy ring on his finger. Saffary walked hard, jumping the ditches\nwhen he came to them, and soon he dripped with sweat. He examined the\ntrees to see that they were properly tapped, and when he came across a\ncoolie at work looking at the shavings and if they were too thick swore\nat him and docked him half a day's pay. When a tree was not to be tapped\nany more he told the overseer to take away the cup and the wire that\nheld it to the trunk. The weeders worked in gangs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt noon Saffary returned to the bungalow and had a drink of beer which,\nbecause there was no ice, was luke-warm. He stripped the khaki shorts,\nthe flannel shirt, the heavy boots and stockings in which he had been\nwalking, and shaved and bathed. He lunched in a sarong and baju. He lay\noff for half an hour, and then went down to his office and worked till\nfive; he had tea and went to the club. About eight he started back for\nthe bungalow, dined, and half an hour after went to bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut last night he went home immediately he had finished his match.\nViolet had not accompanied him that day. When the Clarkes were there\nthey had met at the club every afternoon, but now they had gone home she\ncame less often. She said there was no one there who much amused her and\nshe had heard everything everyone had to say till she was fed to the\nteeth. She did not play bridge and it was dull for her to wait about\nwhile he played. She told Tom he need not mind leaving her alone. She\nhad plenty of things to do in the house.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs soon as she saw him back so early she guessed that he had come to\ntell her that he had won his match. He was like a child in his\nself-satisfaction over one of these small triumphs. He was a kindly,\nsimple creature and she knew that his pleasure at winning was not only\non his own account, but because he thought it must give her pleasure\ntoo. It was rather sweet of him to hurry home in order to tell her all\nabout it without delay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, how did your match go?\" she said as soon as he came lumbering\ninto the sitting-room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I won.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Easily?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, not as easily as I should have. I was a bit ahead, and then I\nstuck, I couldn't do a thing, and you know what Douglas is, not at all\nshowy, but steady, and he pulled up with me. Then I said to myself,\nwell, if I don't buck up I shall get a licking, I had a bit of luck here\nand there, and then, to cut a long story short, I beat him by seven.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Isn't that splendid? You ought to win the cup now, oughtn't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I've got three matches more. If I can get into the semifinals I\nought to have a chance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nViolet smiled. She was anxious to show him that she was as much\ninterested as he expected her to be.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What made you go to pieces when you did?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis face sagged.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's why I came back at once. I'd have scratched only I thought it\nwasn't fair on the fellows who'd backed me. I don't know how to tell\nyou, Violet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a questioning look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, what's the matter? Not bad news?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Rotten. Knobby's dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a full minute she stared at him, and her face, her neat friendly\nlittle face, grew haggard with horror. At first it seemed as though she\ncould not understand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What <i>do</i> you mean?\" she cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was in the paper. He died on board. They buried him at sea.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSuddenly she gave a piercing cry and fell headlong to the floor. She had\nfainted dead away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Violet,\" he cried, and threw himself down on his knees and took her\nhead in his arms. \"Boy, boy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA boy, startled by the terror in his master's voice, rushed in and\nSaffary shouted to him to bring brandy. He forced a little between\nViolet's lips. She opened her eyes, and as she remembered they grew dark\nwith anguish. Her face was screwed up like a little child's when it is\njust going to burst into tears. He lifted her up in his arms and laid\nher on the sofa. She turned her head away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Tom, it isn't true. It can't be true.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid it is.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, no, no.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe burst into tears. She wept convulsively. It was dreadful to hear\nher. Saffary did not know what to do. He knelt beside her and tried to\nsoothe her. He sought to take her in his arms, but with a sudden gesture\nshe repelled him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't touch me,\" she cried, and she said it so sharply that he was\nstartled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe rose to his feet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Try not to take it too hard, sweetie,\" he said. \"I know it's been an\nawful shock. He was one of the best.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe buried her face in the cushions and wept despairingly. It tortured\nhim to see her body shaken by those uncontrollable sobs. She was beside\nherself. He put his hand gently on her shoulder.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Darling, don't give way like that. It's so bad for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shook herself free from his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For God's sake leave me alone,\" she cried. \"Oh, Hal, Hal.\" He had never\nheard her call the dead man that before. Of course his name was Harold,\nbut everyone called him Knobby. \"What shall I do?\" she wailed. \"I can't\nbear it. I can't bear it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSaffary began to grow a trifle impatient. So much grief did seem to him\nexaggerated. Violet was not normally so emotional. He supposed it was\nthe damned climate. It made women nervous and high-strung. Violet hadn't\nbeen home for four years. She was not hiding her face now. She lay,\nalmost falling off the sofa, her mouth open in the extremity of her\npain, and the tears streamed from her staring eyes. She was distraught.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have a little more brandy,\" he said. \"Try and pull yourself together,\ndarling. You can't do Knobby any good by getting in such a state.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith a sudden gesture she sprang to her feet and pushed him aside. She\ngave him a look of hatred.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go away, Tom. I don't want your sympathy. I want to be left alone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe walked swiftly over to an arm-chair and threw herself down in it.\nShe flung back her head and her poor white face was wrenched into a\ngrimace of agony.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, it's not fair,\" she moaned. \"What's to become of me now? Oh, God, I\nwish I were dead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Violet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis voice quavered with pain. He was very nearly crying too. She stamped\nher foot impatiently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go away, I tell you. Go away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe started. He stared at her and suddenly gasped. A shudder passed\nthrough his great bulk. He took a step towards her and stopped, but his\neyes never left her white, tortured face; he stared as though he saw in\nit something that appalled him. Then he dropped his head and without a\nword walked out of the room. He went into a little sitting-room they had\nat the back, but seldom used, and sank heavily into a chair. He thought.\nPresently the gong sounded for dinner. He had not had his bath. He gave\nhis hands a glance. He could not be bothered to wash them. He walked\nslowly into the dining-room. He told the boy to go and tell Violet that\ndinner was ready. The boy came back and said she did not want any.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right. Let me have mine then,\" said Saffary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sent Violet in a plate of soup and a piece of toast, and when the\nfish was served put some on a plate for her and gave it to the boy. But\nthe boy came back with it at once.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mem, she say no wantchee,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSaffary ate his dinner alone. He ate from habit, solidly, through the\nfamiliar courses. He drank a bottle of beer. When he had finished the\nboy brought him a cup of coffee and he lit a cheroot. Saffary sat still\ntill he had finished it. He thought. At last he got up and went back\ninto the large verandah which was where they always sat. Violet was\nstill huddled in the chair in which he had left her. Her eyes were\nclosed, but she opened them when she heard him come. He took a light\nchair and sat down in front of her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What <i>was</i> Knobby to you, Violet?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave a slight start. She turned away her eyes, but did not speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't quite make out why you should have been so frightfully upset by\nthe news of his death.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was an awful shock.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course. But it seems very strange that anyone should go simply all\nto pieces over the death of a friend.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't understand what you mean,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe could hardly speak the words and he saw that her lips were\ntrembling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've never heard you call him Hal. Even his wife called him Knobby.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe did not say anything. Her eyes, heavy with grief, were fixed on\nvacancy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look at me, Violet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe turned her head slightly and listlessly gazed at him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Was he your lover?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe closed her eyes and tears flowed from them. Her mouth was strangely\ntwisted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Haven't you got anything to say at all?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shook her head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must answer me, Violet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not fit to talk to you now,\" she moaned. \"How can you be so\nheartless?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I don't feel very sympathetic at the moment. We must get\nthis straight now. Would you like a drink of water?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want anything.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then answer my question.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You have no right to ask it. It's insulting.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you ask me to believe that a woman like you who hears of the death\nof someone she knew is going to faint dead away and then, when she comes\nto, is going to cry like that? Why, one wouldn't be so upset over the\ndeath of one's only child. When we heard of your mother's death you\ncried of course, anyone would, and I know you were utterly miserable,\nbut you came to me for comfort and you said you didn't know what you'd\nhave done without me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This was so frightfully sudden.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your mother's death was sudden, too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Naturally I was very fond of Knobby.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How fond? So fond that when you heard he was dead you didn't know and\nyou didn't care what you said? Why did you say it wasn't fair? Why did\nyou say, 'What's going to become of me now?'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe sighed deeply. She turned her head this way and that like a sheep\ntrying to avoid the hands of the butcher.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You mustn't take me for an utter fool, Violet. I tell you it's\nimpossible that you should be so shattered by the blow if there hadn't\nbeen something between you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if you think that, why do you torture me with questions?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear, it's no good shilly-shallying. We can't go on like this. What\nd'you think I'm feeling?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him when he said this. She hadn't thought of him at all.\nShe had been too much absorbed in her own misery to be concerned with\nhis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm so tired,\" she sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe leaned forward and roughly seized her wrist.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Speak,\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're hurting me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what about me? D'you think you're not hurting me? How can you have\nthe heart to let me suffer like this?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe let go of her arm and sprang to his feet. He walked to the end of the\nroom and back again. It looked as though the movement had suddenly\nroused him to fury. He caught her by the shoulders and dragged her to\nher feet. He shook her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you don't tell me the truth I'll kill you,\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish you would,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was your lover?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You swine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith one hand still on her shoulder so that she could not move he swung\nback his other arm and with a flat palm struck her repeatedly, with all\nhis strength, on the side of her face. She quivered under the blows, but\ndid not flinch or cry out. He struck her again and again. All at once he\nfelt her strangely inert, he let go of her and she sank unconscious to\nthe floor. Fear seized him. He bent down and touched her, calling her\nname. She did not move. He lifted her up and put her back into the chair\nfrom which a little while before he had pulled her. The brandy that had\nbeen brought when first she fainted was still in the room and he fetched\nit and tried to force it down her throat. She choked and it spilt over\nher chin and neck. One side of her pale face was livid from the blows of\nhis heavy hand. She sighed a little and opened her eyes. He held the\nglass again to her lips, supporting her head, and she sipped a little of\nthe neat spirit. He looked at her with penitent, anxious eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry, Violet. I didn't mean to do that. I'm dreadfully ashamed of\nmyself. I never thought I could sink so low as to hit a woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThough she was feeling very weak and her face was hurting, the flicker\nof a smile crossed her lips. Poor Tom. He did say things like that. He\nfelt like that. And how scandalised he would be if you asked him why a\nman shouldn't hit a woman. But Saffary, seeing the wan smile, put it\ndown to her indomitable courage. By God, she's a plucky little woman, he\nthought. Game isn't the word.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give me a cigarette,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took one out of his case and put it in her mouth. He made two or\nthree ineffectual attempts to strike his lighter. It would not work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hadn't you better get a match?\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor the moment she had forgotten her heart-rending grief and was faintly\namused at the situation. He took a box from the table and held the\nlighted match to her cigarette. She inhaled the first puff with a sense\nof infinite relief.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't tell you how ashamed I am, Violet,\" he said. \"I'm disgusted\nwith myself. I don't know what came over me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, that's all right. It was very natural. Why don't you have a drink?\nIt'll do you good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWithout a word, his shoulders all hunched up as though the burden that\noppressed him were material, he helped himself to a brandy and soda.\nThen, still silent, he sat down. She watched the blue smoke curl into\nthe air.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do?\" she said at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave a weary gesture of despair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'll talk about that to-morrow. You're not in a fit state to-night. As\nsoon as you've finished your cigarette you'd better go to bed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know so much, you'd better know everything.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not now, Violet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe began to speak. He heard her words, but could hardly make sense of\nthem. He felt like a man who has built himself a house with loving care\nand thought to live in it all his life, and then, he does not understand\nwhy, sees the housebreakers come and with their picks and heavy hammers\ndestroy it room by room, till what was a fair dwelling-place is only a\nheap of rubble. What made it so awful was that it was Knobby Clarke who\nhad done this thing. They had come out to the F.M.S. on the same ship\nand had worked at first on the same estate. They call the young planter\na creeper and you can tell him in the streets of Singapore by his double\nfelt hat and his khaki coat turned up at the wrists. Callow youths who\nsaunter about staring and are inveigled by wily Chinese into buying\nworthless truck from Birmingham which they send home as Eastern curios,\nsit in the lounges of cheap hotels drinking innumerable stengahs, and\nafter an evening at the pictures get into rickshaws and finish the night\nin the Chinese quarter. Tom and Knobby were inseparable. Tom, a big,\npowerful fellow, simple, very honest, hard-working; and Knobby,\nungainly, but curiously attractive, with his deep-set eyes, hollow\ncheeks and large humorous mouth. It was Knobby who made the jokes and\nTom who laughed at them. Tom married first. He met Violet when he went\non leave. The daughter of a doctor killed in the war, she was governess\nin the house of some people who lived in the same place as his father.\nHe fell in love with her because she was alone in the world, and his\ntender heart was touched by the thought of the drab life that lay before\nher. But Knobby married because Tom had and he felt lost without him, a\ngirl who had come East to spend the winter with relations. Enid Clarke\nhad been very pretty then in her blonde way, and full-face she was\npretty still, though her skin, once so clear and fresh, was already\nfaded; but she had a very weak, small, insignificant chin and in profile\nreminded you of a sheep. She had pretty flaxen hair, straight, because\nin the heat it would not keep its wave, and china-blue eyes. Though but\ntwenty-six, she had already a tired look. A year after marriage she had\na baby, but it died when only two years old. It was after this that Tom\nSaffary managed to get Knobby the post of manager of the estate next his\nown. The two men pleasantly resumed their old familiarity, and their\nwives, who till then had not known one another very well, soon made\nfriends. They copied one another's frocks and lent one another servants\nand crockery when they gave a party. The four of them met every day.\nThey went everywhere together. Tom Saffary thought it grand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe strange thing was that Violet and Knobby Clarke lived on these terms\nof close intimacy for three years before they fell in love with one\nanother. Neither saw love approaching. Neither suspected that in the\npleasure each took in the other's company there was anything more than\nthe casual friendship of two persons thrown together by the\ncircumstances of life. To be together gave them no particular happiness,\nbut merely a quiet sense of comfort. If by chance a day passed without\ntheir meeting they felt unaccountably bored. That seemed very natural.\nThey played games together. They danced together. They chaffed one\nanother. The revelation came to them by what looked like pure accident.\nThey had all been to a dance at the club and were driving home in\nSaffary's car. The Clarkes' estate was on the way and he was dropping\nthem at their bungalow. Violet and Knobby sat in the back. He had had a\ngood deal to drink, but was not drunk; their hands touched by chance,\nand he took hers and held it. They did not speak. They were all tired.\nBut suddenly the exhilaration of the champagne left him and he was cold\nsober. They knew in a flash that they were madly in love with one\nanother and at the same moment they realised that they had never been in\nlove before. When they reached the Clarkes's Tom said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd better hop in beside me, Violet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm too exhausted to move,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer legs seemed so weak that she thought she would never be able to\nstand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen they met next day neither referred to what had happened, but each\nknew that something inevitable had passed. They behaved to one another\nas they had always done, they continued to behave so for weeks, but they\nfelt that everything was different. At last flesh and blood could stand\nit no longer and they became lovers. But the physical tie seemed to them\nthe least important element in their relation, and indeed their way of\nliving made it impossible for them, except very seldom, to enjoy any\nintimate connection. It was enough that they saw one another, though in\nthe company of others, every day; a glance, a touch of the hand, assured\nthem of their love, and that was all that mattered. The sexual act was\nno more than an affirmation of the union of their souls.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey very seldom talked of Tom or Enid. If sometimes they laughed\ntogether at their foibles it was not unkindly. It might have seemed odd\nto them to realise how completely these two people whom they saw so\nconstantly had ceased to matter to them if they had given them enough\nthought to consider the matter. Their relations with them fell into the\nroutine of life that nobody notices, like shaving oneself, dressing and\neating three meals a day. They felt tenderly towards them. They even\ntook pains to please them, as you would with a bed-ridden invalid,\nbecause their own happiness was so great that in charity they must do\nwhat they could for others less fortunate. They had no scruples. They\nwere too much absorbed in one another to be touched even for a moment by\nremorse. Beauty now excitingly kindled the pleasant humdrum life they\nhad led so long.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut then an event took place that filled them with consternation. The\ncompany for which Tom worked entered into negotiations to buy extensive\nrubber plantations in British North Borneo and invited Tom to manage\nthem. It was a better job than his present one, with a higher salary,\nand since he would have assistants under him he would not have to work\nso hard. Saffary welcomed the offer. Both Clarke and Saffary were due\nfor leave and the two couples had arranged to travel home together. They\nhad already booked their passages. This changed everything. Tom would\nnot be able to get away for at least a year. By the time the Clarkes\ncame back the Saffarys would be settled in Borneo. It did not take\nViolet and Knobby long to decide that there was only one thing to do.\nThey had been willing enough to go on as they were, notwithstanding the\nhindrances to the enjoyment of their love, when they were certain of\nseeing one another continually; they felt that they had endless time\nbefore them and the future was coloured with a happiness that seemed to\nhave no limit; but neither could suffer for an instant the thought of\nseparation. They made up their minds to run away together, and then it\nseemed to them on a sudden that every day that passed before they could\nbe together always and all the time was a day lost. Their love took\nanother guise. It flamed into a devouring passion that left them no\nemotion to waste on others. They cared little for the pain they must\ncause Tom and Enid. It was unfortunate, but inevitable. They made their\nplans deliberately. Knobby on the pretence of business would go to\nSingapore and Violet, telling Tom that she was going to spend a week\nwith friends on an estate down the line, would join him there. They\nwould go over to Java and thence take ship to Sydney. In Sydney Knobby\nwould look for a job. When Violet told Tom that the Mackenzies had asked\nher to spend a few days with them, he was pleased.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's grand. I think you want a change, darling,\" he said. \"I've\nfancied you've been looking a bit peaked lately.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe stroked her cheek affectionately. The gesture stabbed her heart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've always been awfully good to me, Tom,\" she said, her eyes\nsuddenly filled with tears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, that's the least I could be. You're the best little woman in the\nworld.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you been happy with me these eight years?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Frightfully.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, that's something, isn't it? No one can ever take that away from\nyou.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe had told herself that he was the kind of man who would soon console\nhimself. He liked women for themselves and it would not be long after he\nhad regained his freedom before he found someone that he would wish to\nmarry. And he would be just as happy with his new wife as he had been\nwith her. Perhaps he would marry Enid. Enid was one of those dependent\nlittle things that somewhat exasperated her and she did not think her\ncapable of deep feeling. Her vanity would be hurt; her heart would not\nbe broken. But now that the die was cast, everything settled and the day\nfixed, she had a qualm. Remorse beset her. She wished that it had been\npossible not to cause those two people such fearful distress. She\nfaltered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We've had a very good time here, Tom,\" she said. \"I wonder if it's wise\nto leave it all. We're giving up a certainty for we don't know what.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear child, it's a chance in a million and much better money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Money isn't everything. There's happiness.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know that, but there's no reason why we shouldn't be just as happy in\nB.N.B. And besides, there was no alternative. I'm not my own master. The\ndirectors want me to go and I must, and that's all there is to it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe sighed. There was no alternative for her either. She shrugged her\nshoulders. It was hateful to cause others pain; sometimes you couldn't\nhelp yourself. Tom meant no more to her than the casual man on the\nvoyage out who was civil to you: it was absurd that she should be asked\nto sacrifice her life for him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Clarkes were due to sail for England in a fortnight and this\ndetermined the date of their elopement. The days passed. Violet was\nrestless and excited. She looked forward with a joy that was almost\npainful to the peace that she anticipated when they were once on board\nthe ship and could begin the life which she was sure would give her at\nlast perfect happiness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe began to pack. The friends she was supposed to be going to stay with\nentertained a good deal and this gave her an excuse to take quite a lot\nof luggage. She was starting next day. It was eleven o'clock in the\nmorning and Tom was making his round of the estate. One of the boys came\nto her room and told her that Mrs. Clarke was there and at the same\nmoment she heard Enid calling her. Quickly closing the lid of her trunk,\nshe went out on to the verandah. To her astonishment Enid came up to\nher, flung her arms round her neck and kissed her eagerly. She looked at\nEnid and saw that her cheeks, usually pale, were flushed and that her\neyes were shining. Enid burst into tears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What on earth's the matter, darling?\" she cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor one moment she was afraid that Enid knew everything. But Enid was\nflushed with delight and not with jealousy or anger.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've just seen Dr. Harrow,\" she said. \"I didn't want to say anything\nabout it. I've had two or three false alarms, but this time he says it's\nall right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA sudden coldness pierced Violet's heart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean? You're not going to...\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at Enid and Enid nodded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, he says there's no doubt about it at all. He thinks I'm at least\nthree months gone. Oh, my dear, I'm so wildly happy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe flung herself again into Violet's arms and clung to her, weeping.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, darling, don't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nViolet felt herself grow pale as death and knew that if she didn't keep\na tight hold of herself she would faint.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does Knobby know?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I didn't say a word. He was so disappointed before. He was so\nfrightfully cut up when baby died. He's wanted me to have another so\nbadly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nViolet forced herself to say the things that were expected of her, but\nEnid was not listening. She wanted to tell the whole story of her hopes\nand fears, of her symptoms, and then of her interview with the doctor.\nShe went on and on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When are you going to tell Knobby?\" Violet asked at last. \"Now, when he\ngets in?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, no, he's tired and hungry when he gets back from his round. I shall\nwait till to-night after dinner.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nViolet repressed a movement of exasperation; Enid was going to make a\nscene of it and was choosing her moment; but after all, it was only\nnatural. It was lucky, for it would give her the chance to see Knobby\nfirst. As soon as she was rid of her she rang him up. She knew that he\nalways looked in at his office on his way home, and she left a message\nasking him to call her. She was only afraid that he would not do so till\nTom was back, but she had to take her chance of that. The bell rang and\nTom had not yet come in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hal?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you be at the hut at three?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. Has anything happened?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll tell you when I see you. Don't worry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe rang off. The hut was a little shelter on Knobby's estate which she\ncould get to without difficulty and where they occasionally met. The\ncoolies passed it while they worked and it had no privacy; but it was a\nconvenient place for them without exciting comment to exchange a few\nminutes' conversation. At three Enid would be resting and Tom at work in\nhis office.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Violet walked up Knobby was already there. He gave a gasp.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Violet, how white you are.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him her hand. They did not know what eyes might be watching\nthem and their behaviour here was always such as anyone could observe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Enid came to see me this morning. She's going to tell you to-night. I\nthought you ought to be warned. She's going to have a baby.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Violet!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at her aghast. She began to cry. They had never talked of the\nrelations they had, he with his wife and she with her husband. They\nignored the subject because it was to each horribly painful. Violet knew\nwhat her own life was; she satisfied her husband's appetite, but, with a\nwoman's strange nonchalance, because to do so gave her no pleasure,\nattached no importance to it; but somehow she had persuaded herself that\nwith Hal it was different. He felt now instinctively how bitterly what\nshe had learned wounded her. He tried to excuse himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Darling, I couldn't help myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe cried silently and he watched her with miserable eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know it seems beastly,\" he said, \"but what could I do? It wasn't as\nif I had any reason to...\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe interrupted him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't blame you. It was inevitable. It's only because I'm stupid that\nit gives me such a frightful pain in my heart.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Darling!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We ought to have gone away together two years ago. It was madness to\nthink we could go on like this.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you sure Enid's right? She thought she was in the family way three\nor four years ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, yes, she's right. She's frightfully happy. She says you wanted a\nchild so badly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's come as such an awful surprise. I don't seem able to realise it\nyet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at him. He was staring at the leaf-strewn earth with harassed\neyes. She smiled a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor Hal.\" She sighed deeply. \"There's nothing to be done about it.\nIt's the end of us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean?\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my dear, you can't very well leave her now, can you? It was all\nright before. She would have been unhappy, but she would have got over\nit. But now it's different. It's not a very nice time for a woman\nanyhow. For months she feels more or less ill. She wants affection. She\nwants to be taken care of. It would be frightful to leave her to bear it\nall alone. We couldn't be such beasts.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean to say you want me to go back to England with her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe nodded gravely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's lucky you're going. It'll be easier when you get away and we don't\nsee one another every day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I can't live without you now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, yes, you can. You must. I can. And it'll be worse for me, because I\nstay behind and I shall have nothing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Violet, it's impossible.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear, it's no good arguing. The moment she told me I saw it meant\nthat. That's why I wanted to see you first. I thought the shock might\nlead you to blurt out the whole truth. You know I love you more than\nanything in the world. She's never done me any harm. I couldn't take you\naway from her now. It's bad luck on both of us, but there it is, I\nsimply wouldn't dare to do a filthy thing like that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish I were dead,\" he moaned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That wouldn't do her any good, or me either,\" she smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What about the future? Have we got to sacrifice our whole lives?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid so. It sounds rather grim, darling, but I suppose sooner or\nlater we shall get over it. One gets over everything.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe looked at her wrist-watch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I ought to be getting back. Tom will be in soon. We're all meeting at\nthe club at five.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tom and I are supposed to be playing tennis.\" He gave her a pitiful\nlook. \"Oh, Violet, I'm so frightfully unhappy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know. So am I. But we shan't do any good by talking about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him her hand, but he took her in his arms and kissed her, and\nwhen she released herself her cheeks were wet with his tears. But she\nwas so desperate she could not cry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTen days later the Clarkes sailed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhile George Moon was listening to as much of this story as Tom Saffary\nwas able to tell him, he reflected in his cool, detached way how odd it\nwas that these commonplace people, leading lives so monotonous, should\nhave been convulsed by such a tragedy. Who would have thought that\nViolet Saffary, so neat and demure, sitting in the club reading the\nillustrated papers or chatting with her friends over a lemon squash,\nshould have been eating her heart out for love of that ordinary man?\nGeorge Moon remembered seeing Knobby at the club the evening before he\nsailed. He seemed in great spirits. Fellows envied him because he was\ngoing home. Those who had recently come back told him by no means to\nmiss the show at the Pavilion. Drink flowed freely. The Resident had not\nbeen asked to the farewell party the Saffarys gave for the Clarkes, but\nhe knew very well what it had been like, the good cheer, the cordiality,\nthe chaff, and then after dinner the gramophone turned on and everyone\ndancing. He wondered what Violet and Clarke had felt as they danced\ntogether. It gave him an odd sensation of dismay to think of the despair\nthat must have filled their hearts while they pretended to be so gay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd with another part of his mind George Moon thought of his own past.\nVery few knew that story. After all, it had happened twenty-five years\nago.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do now, Saffary?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, that's what I wanted you to advise me about. Now that Knobby's\ndead I don't know what's going to happen to Violet if I divorce her. I\nwas wondering if I oughtn't to let her divorce me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, you want to divorce?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I must.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Moon lit another cigarette and watched for a moment the smoke\nthat curled away into the air.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you ever know that I'd been married?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I think I'd heard. You're a widower, aren't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I divorced my wife. I have a son of twenty-seven. He's farming in\nNew Zealand. I saw my wife the last time I was home on leave. We met at\na play. At first we didn't recognise one another. She spoke to me. I\nasked her to lunch at the Berkeley.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Moon chuckled to himself. He was alone. It was a musical comedy.\nHe found himself sitting next to a large fat dark woman whom he vaguely\nthought he had seen before, but the play was just starting and he did\nnot give her a second look. When the curtain fell after the first act\nshe looked at him with bright eyes and spoke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How are you, George?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was his wife. She had a bold, friendly manner and was very much at\nher ease.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a long time since we met,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How has life been treating you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you're a Resident now. You're still in the Service, aren't\nyou?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. I'm retiring soon, worse luck.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why? You look very fit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm reaching the age limit. I'm supposed to be an old buffer and no\ngood any more.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're lucky to have kept so thin. I'm terrible, aren't I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't look as though you were wasting away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know. I'm stout and I'm growing stouter all the time. I can't help it\nand I love food. I can't resist cream and bread and potatoes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Moon laughed, but not at what she said; at his own thoughts. In\nyears gone by it had sometimes occurred to him that he might meet her,\nbut he had never thought that the meeting would take this turn. When the\nplay was ended and with a smile she bade him good-night, he said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you wouldn't lunch with me one day?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Any day you like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey arranged a date and duly met. He knew that she had married the man\non whose account he had divorced her, and he judged by her clothes that\nshe was in comfortable circumstances. They drank a cocktail. She ate the\n<i>hors-d'oeuvres</i> with gusto. She was fifty if she was a day, but she\ncarried her years with spirit. There was something jolly and careless\nabout her, she was quick on the uptake, chatty, and she had the hearty,\ninfectious laugh of the fat woman who has let herself go. If he had not\nknown that her family had for a century been in the Indian Civil Service\nhe would have thought that she had been a chorus girl. She was not\nflashy, but she had a sort of flamboyance of nature that suggested the\nstage. She was not in the least embarrassed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You never married again, did you?\" she asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pity. Because it wasn't a success the first time there's no reason why\nit shouldn't have been the second.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no need for me to ask if you've been happy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got nothing to complain of. I think I've got a happy nature. Jim's\nalways been very good to me; he's retired now, you know, and we live in\nthe country, and I adore Betty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who's Betty?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, she's my daughter. She got married two years ago. I'm expecting to\nbe a grandmother almost any day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That ages us a bit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave a laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Betty's twenty-two. It was nice of you to ask me to lunch, George.\nAfter all, it would be silly to have any feelings about something that\nhappened so long ago as all that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Idiotic.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We weren't fitted to one another and it's lucky we found it out before\nit was too late. Of course I was foolish, but then I was very young.\nHave you been happy too?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I can say I've been a success.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, well, that's probably all the happiness you were capable of.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe smiled in appreciation of her shrewdness. And then, putting the whole\nmatter aside easily, she began to talk of other things. Though the\ncourts had given him custody of their son, he, unable to look after him,\nhad allowed his mother to have him. The boy had emigrated at eighteen\nand was now married. He was a stranger to George Moon, and he was aware\nthat if he met him in the street he would not recognise him. He was too\nsincere to pretend that he took much interest in him. They talked of\nhim, however, for a while, and then they talked of actors and plays.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well,\" she said at last, \"I must be running away. I've had a lovely\nlunch. It's been fun meeting you, George. Thanks so much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put her into a taxi and taking off his hat walked down Piccadilly by\nhimself. He thought her quite a pleasant, amusing woman: he laughed to\nthink that he had ever been madly in love with her. There was a smile on\nhis lips when he spoke again to Tom Saffary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was a damned good-looking girl when I married her. That was the\ntrouble. Though, of course, if she hadn't been I'd never have married\nher. They were all after her like flies round a honeypot. We used to\nhave awful rows. And at last I caught her out. Of course I divorced\nher.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, but I know I was a damned fool to do it.\" He leaned forward. \"My\ndear Saffary, I know now that if I'd had any sense I'd have shut my\neyes. She'd have settled down and made me an excellent wife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe wished he were able to explain to his visitor how grotesque it had\nseemed to him when he sat and talked with that jolly, comfortable and\ngood-humoured woman that he should have made so much fuss about what now\nseemed to him to matter so little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But one has one's honour to think of,\" said Saffary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Honour be damned. One has one's happiness to think of. Is one's honour\nreally concerned because one's wife hops into bed with another man?\nWe're not crusaders, you and I, or Spanish grandees. I <i>liked</i> my wife.\nI don't say I haven't had other women. I have. But she had just that\nsomething that none of the others could give me. What a fool I was to\nthrow away what I wanted more than anything in the world because I\ncouldn't enjoy exclusive possession of it!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're the last man I should ever have expected to hear speak like\nthat.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Moon smiled thinly at the embarrassment that was so clearly\nexpressed on Saffary's fat troubled face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm probably the first man you've heard speak the naked truth,\" he\nretorted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean to say that if it were all to do over again you would act\ndifferently?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If I were twenty-seven again I suppose I should be as big a fool as I\nwas then. But if I had the sense I have now I'll tell you what I'd do if\nI found my wife had been unfaithful to me. I'd do just what you did last\nnight: I'd give her a damned good hiding and let it go at that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you asking me to forgive Violet?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Resident shook his head slowly and smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. You've forgiven her already. I'm merely advising you not to cut off\nyour nose to spite your face.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSaffary gave him a worried look. It disconcerted him to know that this\ncold precise man should see in his heart emotions which seemed so\nunnatural to himself that he thrust them out of his consciousness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't know the circumstances,\" he said. \"Knobby and I were almost\nlike brothers. I got him this job. He owed everything to me. And except\nfor me Violet might have gone on being a governess for the rest of her\nlife. It seemed such a waste; I couldn't help feeling sorry for her. If\nyou know what I mean, it was pity that first made me take any notice of\nher. Don't you think it's a bit thick that when you've been thoroughly\ndecent with people they should go out of their way to do the dirty on\nyou? It's such awful ingratitude.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my dear boy, one mustn't expect gratitude. It's a thing that no one\nhas a right to. After all, you do good because it gives you pleasure.\nIt's the purest form of happiness there is. To expect thanks for it is\nreally asking too much. If you get it, well, it's like a bonus on shares\non which you've already received a dividend; it's grand, but you mustn't\nlook upon it as your due.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSaffary frowned. He was perplexed. He could not quite make it out that\nGeorge Moon should think so oddly about things that it had always seemed\nto him there were no two ways of thinking about. After all there were\nlimits. I mean, if you had any sense of decency you had to behave like a\ntuan. There was your own self-respect to think of. It was funny that\nGeorge Moon should give reasons that looked so damned plausible for\ndoing something that, well, damn it, you had to admit you'd be only too\nglad to do if you could see your way to it. Of course George Moon was\nqueer. No one ever quite understood him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Knobby Clarke is dead, Saffary. You can't be jealous of him any more.\nNo one knows a thing except you and me and your wife, and to-morrow I'm\ngoing away for ever. Why don't you let bygones be bygones?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Violet would only despise me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Moon smiled and, unexpectedly on that prim, fastidious face, his\nsmile had a singular sweetness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know her very little. I always thought her a very nice woman. Is she\nas detestable as that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSaffary gave a start and reddened to his ears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, she's an angel of goodness. It's me who's detestable for saying\nthat of her.\" His voice broke and he gave a little sob. \"God knows I\nonly want to do the right thing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The right thing is the kind thing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSaffary covered his face with his hands. He could not curb the emotion\nthat shook him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I seem to be giving, giving all the time, and no one does a God-damned\nthing for me. It doesn't matter if my heart is broken, I must just go\non.\" He drew the back of his hand across his eyes and sighed deeply.\n\"I'll forgive her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Moon looked at him reflectively for a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't make too much of a song and dance about it, if I were you,\"\nhe said. \"You'll have to walk warily. She'll have a lot to forgive too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Because I hit her, you mean? I know, that was awful of me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not a bit. It did her a power of good. I didn't mean that. You're\nbehaving very generously, old boy, and, you know, one needs a devil of a\nlot of tact to get people to forgive one one's generosity. Fortunately\nwomen are frivolous and they very quickly forget the benefits conferred\nupon them. Otherwise, of course, there'd be no living with them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSaffary looked at him open-mouthed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Upon my word you're a rum 'un, Moon,\" he said. \"Sometimes you seem as\nhard as nails and then you talk so that one thinks you're almost human,\nand then, just as one thinks one's misjudged you and you have a heart\nafter all, you come out with something that just shocks one. I suppose\nthat's what they call a cynic.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't deeply considered the matter,\" smiled George Moon, \"but if to\nlook truth in the face and not resent it when it's unpalatable, and take\nhuman nature as you find it, smiling when it's absurd and grieved\nwithout exaggeration when it's pitiful, is to be cynical, then I suppose\nI'm a cynic. Mostly human nature is both absurd and pitiful, but if life\nhas taught you tolerance you find in it more to smile at than to weep.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Tom Saffary left the room the Resident lit himself with\ndeliberation the last cigarette he meant to smoke before tiffin. It was\na new rôle for him to reconcile an angry husband with an erring wife and\nit caused him a discreet amusement. He continued to reflect upon human\nnature. A wintry smile hovered upon his thin and pallid lips. He\nrecalled with what interest in the dry creeks of certain places along\nthe coast he had often stood and watched the Jumping Johnnies. There\nwere hundreds of them sometimes, from little things of a couple of\ninches long to great fat fellows as long as your foot. They were the\ncolour of the mud they lived in. They sat and looked at you with large\nround eyes and then with a sudden dash buried themselves in their holes.\nIt was extraordinary to see them scudding on their flappers over the\nsurface of the mud. It teemed with them. They gave you a fearful feeling\nthat the mud itself was mysteriously become alive and an atavistic\nterror froze your heart when you remembered that such creatures, but\ngigantic and terrible, were once the only inhabitants of the earth.\nThere was something uncanny about them, but something amusing too. They\nreminded you very much of human beings. It was quite entertaining to\nstand there for half an hour and observe their gambols.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge Moon took his topee off the peg and not displeased with life\nstepped out into the sunshine.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn lay on her long chair and lazily watched the passengers come\nalong the gangway. The ship had reached Singapore in the night, and\nsince dawn had been taking on cargo; the winches had been grinding away\nall day, but by now her ears were accustomed to their insistent clamour.\nShe had lunched at the Europe, and for lack of anything better to do had\ndriven in a rickshaw through the gay, multitudinous streets of the city.\nSingapore is the meeting-place of many races. The Malays, though natives\nof the soil, dwell uneasily in towns, and are few; and it is the\nChinese, supple, alert and industrious, who throng the streets; the\ndark-skinned Tamils walk on their silent, naked feet, as though they\nwere but brief sojourners in a strange land, but the Bengalis, sleek and\nprosperous, are easy in their surroundings, and self-assured; the sly\nand obsequious Japanese seem busy with pressing and secret affairs; and\nthe English in their topees and white ducks, speeding past in motor-cars\nor at leisure in their rickshaws, wear a nonchalant and careless air.\nThe rulers of these teeming peoples take their authority with a smiling\nunconcern. And now, tired and hot, Mrs. Hamlyn waited for the ship to\nset out again on her long journey across the Indian Ocean.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe waved a rather large hand, for she was a big woman, to the doctor\nand Mrs. Linsell as they came on board. She had been on the ship since\nshe left Yokohama, and had watched with acid amusement the intimacy\nwhich had sprung up between the two. Linsell was a naval officer who had\nbeen attached to the British Embassy at Tokio, and she had wondered at\nthe indifference with which he took the attentions that the doctor paid\nhis wife. Two men came along the gangway, new passengers, and she amused\nherself by trying to discover from their demeanour whether they were\nsingle or married. Close by, a group of men were sitting together on\nrattan chairs, planters she judged by their khaki suits and wide-brimmed\ndouble felt hats, and they kept the deck-steward busy with their orders.\nThey were talking loudly and laughing, for they had all drunk enough to\nmake them somewhat foolishly hilarious, and they were evidently giving\none of their number a send-off; but Mrs. Hamlyn could not tell which it\nwas that was to be a fellow-passenger. The time was growing short. More\npassengers arrived, and then Mr. Jephson with dignity strolled up the\ngangway. He was a consul and was going home on leave. He had joined the\nship at Shanghai and had immediately set about making himself agreeable\nto Mrs. Hamlyn. But just then she was disinclined for anything in the\nnature of a flirtation. She frowned as she thought of the reason which\nwas taking her back to England. She would be spending Christmas at sea,\nfar from anyone who cared two straws about her, and for a moment she\nfelt a little twist at her heartstrings; it vexed her that a subject\nwhich she was so resolute to put away from her should so constantly\nintrude on her unwilling mind.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut a warning bell clanged loudly, and there was a general movement\namong the men who sat beside her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if we don't want to be taken on we'd better be toddling,\" said\none of them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey rose and walked towards the gangway. Now that they were all shaking\nhands she saw who it was that they had come to see the last of. There\nwas nothing very interesting about the man on whom Mrs. Hamlyn's eyes\nrested, but because she had nothing better to do she gave him more than\na casual glance. He was a big fellow, well over six feet high, broad and\nstout; he was dressed in a bedraggled suit of khaki drill and his hat\nwas battered and shabby. His friends left him, but they bandied chaff\nfrom the quay, and Mrs. Hamlyn noticed that he had a strong Irish\nbrogue; his voice was full, loud and hearty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Linsell had gone below and the doctor came and sat down beside Mrs.\nHamlyn. They told one another their small adventures of the day. The\nbell sounded again and presently the ship slid away from the wharf. The\nIrishman waved a last farewell to his friends, and then sauntered\ntowards the chair on which he had left papers and magazines. He nodded\nto the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is that someone you know?\" asked Mrs. Hamlyn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was introduced to him at the club before tiffin. His name is\nGallagher. He's a planter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter the hubbub of the port and the noisy bustle of departure, the\nsilence of the ship was marked and grateful. They steamed slowly past\ngreen-clad, rocky cliffs (the P. &amp; O. anchorage was in a charming and\nsecluded cove), and came out into the main harbour. Ships of all nations\nlay at anchor, a great multitude, passenger boats, tugs, lighters,\ntramps; and beyond, behind the breakwater, you saw the crowded masts, a\nbare straight forest, of the native junks. In the soft light of the\nevening the busy scene was strangely touched with mystery, and you felt\nthat all those vessels, their activity for the moment suspended, waited\nfor some event of a peculiar significance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn was a bad sleeper and when the dawn broke she was in the\nhabit of going on deck. It rested her troubled heart to watch the last\nfaint stars fade before the encroaching day, and at that early hour the\nglassy sea had often an immobility which seemed to make all earthly\nsorrows of little consequence. The light was wan, and there was a\npleasant shiver in the air. But next morning, when she went to the end\nof the promenade deck, she found that someone was up before her. It was\nMr. Gallagher. He was watching the low coast of Sumatra which the\nsunrise like a magician seemed to call forth from the dark sea. She was\nstartled and a little vexed, but before she could turn away he had seen\nher and nodded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Up early,\" he said. \"Have a cigarette?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was in pyjamas and slippers. He took his case from his coat pocket\nand handed it to her. She hesitated. She had on nothing but a\ndressing-gown and a little lace cap which she had put over her tousled\nhair, and she knew that she must look a sight; but she had her reasons\nfor scourging her soul.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose a woman of forty has no right to mind how she looks,\" she\nsmiled, as though he must know what vain thoughts occupied her. She took\nthe cigarette. \"But you're up early too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm a planter. I've had to get up at five in the morning for so many\nyears that I don't know how I'm going to get out of the habit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll not find it will make you very popular at home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe saw his face better now that it was not shadowed by a hat. It was\nagreeable without being handsome. He was of course much too fat, and his\nfeatures, which must have been good enough when he was a young man, were\nthickened. His skin was red and bloated. But his dark eyes were merry;\nand though he could not have been less than five and forty his hair was\nblack and thick. He gave you an impression of great strength. He was a\nheavy, ungraceful, commonplace man, and Mrs. Hamlyn, except for the\npromiscuity of ship-board, would never have thought it worth while to\ntalk to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you going home on leave?\" she hazarded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I'm going home for good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis black eyes twinkled. He was of a communicative turn, and before it\nwas time for Mrs. Hamlyn to go below in order to have her bath he had\ntold her a good deal about himself. He had been in the Federated Malay\nStates for twenty-five years, and for the last ten had managed an estate\nin Selantan. It was a hundred miles from anything that could be\ndescribed as civilisation and the life had been lonely; but he had made\nmoney; during the rubber boom he had done very well, and with an\nastuteness which was unexpected in a man who looked so happy-go-lucky he\nhad invested his savings in government stock. Now that the slump had\ncome he was prepared to retire.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What part of Ireland do you come from?\" asked Mrs. Hamlyn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Galway.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn had once motored through Ireland and she had a vague\nrecollection of a sad and moody town with great stone warehouses,\ndeserted and crumbling, which faced the melancholy sea. She had a\nsensation of greenness and of soft rain, of silence and of resignation.\nWas it here that Mr. Gallagher meant to spend the rest of his life? He\nspoke of it with boyish eagerness. The thought of his vitality in that\ngrey world of shadows was so incongruous that Mrs. Hamlyn was intrigued.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does your family live there?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got no family. My mother and father are dead. So far as I know I\nhaven't a relation in the world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had made all his plans, he had been making them for twenty-five\nyears, and he was pleased to have someone to talk to of all these things\nthat he had been obliged for so long only to talk to himself about. He\nmeant to buy a house and he would keep a motor-car. He was going to\nbreed horses. He didn't much care about shooting; he had shot a lot of\nbig game during his first years in the F.M.S.; but now he had lost his\nzest. He didn't see why the beasts of the jungle should be killed; he\nhad lived in the jungle so long. But he could hunt.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think I'm too heavy?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn, smiling, looked him up and down with appraising eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must weigh a ton,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe laughed. The Irish horses were the best in the world, and he'd always\nkept pretty fit. You had a devil of a lot of walking exercise on a\nrubber estate and he'd played a good deal of tennis. He'd soon get thin\nin Ireland. Then he'd marry. Mrs. Hamlyn looked silently at the sea\ncoloured now with the tenderness of the sunrise. She sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Was it easy to drag up all your roots? Is there no one you regret\nleaving behind? I should have thought after so many years, however much\nyou'd looked forward to going home, when the time came at last to go it\nmust have given you a pang.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was glad to get out. I was fed up. I never want to see the country\nagain or anyone in it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne or two early passengers now began to walk round the deck and Mrs.\nHamlyn, remembering that she was scantily clad, went below.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDuring the next day or two she saw little of Mr. Gallagher, who passed\nhis time in the smoking-room. Owing to a strike the ship was not\ntouching at Colombo and the passengers settled down to a pleasant voyage\nacross the Indian Ocean. They played deck games, they gossiped about one\nanother, they flirted. The approach of Christmas gave them an\noccupation, for someone had suggested that there should be a fancy-dress\ndance on Christmas Day, and the ladies set about making their dresses. A\nmeeting was held of the first-class passengers to decide whether the\nsecond-class passengers should be invited, and notwithstanding the heat\nthe discussion was animated. The ladies said that the second-class\npassengers would only feel ill-at-ease. On Christmas Day it was to be\nexpected that they would drink more than was good for them and\nunpleasantness might ensue. Everyone who spoke insisted that there was\nin his (or her) mind no idea of class distinction, no one would be so\nsnobbish as to think there was any difference between first and\nsecond-class passengers as far as that went, but it would really be\nkinder to the second-class passengers not to put them in a false\nposition. They would enjoy themselves much more if they had a party of\ntheir own in the second-class cabin. On the other hand, no one wanted to\nhurt their feelings, and of course one had to be more democratic\nnowadays (this was in reply to the wife of a missionary in China who\nsaid she had travelled on the P. &amp; O. for thirty-five years and she had\nnever heard of the second-class passengers being invited to a dance in\nthe first-class saloon) and even though they wouldn't enjoy it, they\nmight like to come. Mr. Gallagher, dragged unwillingly from the\ncard-table, because it had been foreseen that the voting would be close,\nwas asked his opinion by the consul. He was taking home in the\nsecond-class a man who had been employed on his estate. He raised his\nmassive bulk from the couch on which he sat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As far as I'm concerned I've only got this to say: I've got the man who\nwas looking after our engines with me. He's a rattling good fellow, and\nhe's just as fit to come to your party as I am. But he won't come\nbecause I'm going to make him so drunk on Christmas Day that by six\no'clock he'll be fit for nothing but to be put to bed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Jephson, the consul, gave a distorted smile. On account of his\nofficial position, he had been chosen to preside at the meeting and he\nwished the matter to be taken seriously. He was a man who often said\nthat if a thing was worth doing it was worth doing well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I gather from your observations,\" he said, not without acidity, \"that\nthe question before the meeting does not seem to you of great\nimportance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think it matters a tinker's curse,\" said Gallagher, with\ntwinkling eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn laughed. The scheme was at last devised to invite the\nsecond-class passengers, but to go to the captain privily and point out\nto him the advisability of withholding his consent to their coming into\nthe first-class saloon. It was on the evening of the day on which this\nhappened that Mrs. Hamlyn, having dressed for dinner, came on deck at\nthe same time as Mr. Gallagher.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Just in time for a cocktail, Mrs. Hamlyn,\" he said jovially.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd like one. To tell you the truth I need cheering up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why?\" he smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn thought his smile attractive, but she did not want to answer\nhis question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I told you the other morning,\" she answered cheerfully. \"I'm forty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never met a woman who insisted on the fact so much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey went into the lounge and the Irishman ordered a dry Martini for her\nand a gin pahit for himself. He had lived too long in the East to drink\nanything else.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got hiccups,\" said Mrs. Hamlyn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I've had them all the afternoon,\" he answered carelessly. \"It's\nrather funny, they came on just as we got out of sight of land.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I daresay they'll pass off after dinner.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey drank, the second bell rang, and they went into the dining-saloon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't play bridge?\" he said, as they parted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn did not notice that she saw nothing of Gallagher for two or\nthree days. She was occupied with her own thoughts. They crowded upon\nher when she was sewing; they came between her and the novel with which\nshe sought to cheat their insistence. She had hoped that as the ship\ntook her further away from the scene of her unhappiness, the torment of\nher mind would be eased; but contrariwise, each day that brought her\nnearer England increased her distress. She looked forward with dismay to\nthe bleak emptiness of the life that awaited her; and then, turning her\nexhausted wits from a prospect that made her flinch, she considered, as\nshe had done she knew not how many times before, the situation from\nwhich she had fled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe had been married for twenty years. It was a long time and of course\nshe could not expect her husband to be still madly in love with her; she\nwas not madly in love with him; but they were good friends and they\nunderstood one another. Their marriage, as marriages go, might very well\nhave been looked upon as a success. Suddenly she discovered that he had\nfallen in love. She would not have objected to a flirtation, he had had\nthose before, and she had chaffed him about them; he had not minded\nthat, it somewhat flattered him, and they had laughed together at an\ninclination which was neither deep nor serious. But this was different.\nHe was in love as passionately as a boy of eighteen. He was fifty-two.\nIt was ridiculous. It was indecent. And he loved without sense or\nprudence: by the time the hideous fact was forced upon her all the\nforeigners in Yokohama knew it. After the first shock of astonished\nanger, for he was the last man from whom such a folly might have been\nexpected, she tried to persuade herself that she could have understood,\nand so have forgiven, if he had fallen in love with a girl. Middle-aged\nmen often make fools of themselves with flappers, and after twenty years\nin the Far East she knew that the fifties were the dangerous age for\nmen. But he had no excuse. He was in love with a woman eight years older\nthan herself. It was grotesque, and it made her, his wife, perfectly\nabsurd. Dorothy Lacom was hard on fifty. He had known her for eighteen\nyears, for Lacom, like her own husband, was a silk merchant in Yokohama.\nYear in, year out, they had seen one another three or four times a week,\nand once, when they happened to be in England together, had shared a\nhouse at the seaside. But nothing! Not till a year ago had there been\nanything between them but a chaffing friendship. It was incredible. Of\ncourse Dorothy was a handsome woman; she had a good figure,\nover-developed, perhaps, but still comely; with bold black eyes and a\nred mouth and lovely hair; but all that she had had years before. She\nwas forty-eight. Forty-eight!\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn tackled her husband at once. At first he swore that there\nwas not a word of truth in what she accused him of, but she had her\nproofs; he grew sulky; and at last he admitted what he could no longer\ndeny. Then he said an astonishing thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why should you care?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt maddened her. She answered him with angry scorn. She was voluble,\nfinding in the bitterness of her heart wounding things to say. He\nlistened to her quietly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've not been such a bad husband to you for the twenty years we've been\nmarried. For a long time now we've only been friends. I have a great\naffection for you, and this hasn't altered it in the very smallest\ndegree. I'm giving Dorothy nothing that I take away from you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what have you to complain of in me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing. No man could want a better wife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How can you say that when you have the heart to treat me so cruelly?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want to be cruel to you. I can't help myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what on earth made you fall in love with her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How can I tell? You don't think I wanted to, do you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Couldn't you have resisted?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I tried. I think we both tried.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You talk as though you were twenty. Why, you're both middle-aged\npeople. She's eight years older than I am. It makes me look such a\nperfect fool.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not answer. She did not know what emotions seethed in her heart.\nWas it jealousy that seemed to clutch at her throat, anger, or was it\nmerely wounded pride?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not going to let it go on. If only you and she were concerned I\nwould divorce you, but there's her husband, and then there are the\nchildren. Good heavens, does it occur to you that if they were girls\ninstead of boys she might be a grandmother by now?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Easily.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a mercy that we have no children!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put out an affectionate hand as though to caress her, but she drew\nback with horror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've made me the laughing-stock of all my friends. For all our sakes\nI'm willing to hold my tongue, but only on the condition that everything\nstops now, at once, and for ever.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked down and played reflectively with a Japanese knick-knack that\nwas on the table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll tell Dorothy what you say,\" he replied at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a little bow, silently, and walked past him out of the\nroom. She was too angry to observe that she was somewhat melodramatic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe waited for him to tell her the result of his interview with Dorothy\nLacom, but he made no further reference to the scene. He was quiet,\npolite and silent; and at last she was obliged to ask him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you forgotten what I said to you the other day?\" she inquired,\nfrigidly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. I talked to Dorothy. She wished me to tell you that she is\ndesperately sorry that she has caused you so much pain. She would like\nto come and see you, but she is afraid you wouldn't like it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What decision have you come to?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe hesitated. He was very grave, but his voice trembled a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid there's no use in our making a promise we shouldn't be able\nto keep.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That settles it then,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I should tell you that if you brought an action for divorce we\nshould have to contest it. You would find it impossible to get the\nnecessary evidence and you would lose your case.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wasn't thinking of doing that. I shall go back to England and consult\na lawyer. Nowadays these things can be managed fairly easily, and I\nshall throw myself on your generosity. I dare say you will enable me to\nget my freedom without bringing Dorothy Lacom into the matter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's an awful muddle, isn't it? I don't want you to divorce me, but of\ncourse I'll do anything I can to meet your wishes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What on earth do you expect me to do?\" she cried, her anger rising\nagain. \"Do you expect me to sit still and be made a damned fool of?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm awfully sorry to put you in a humiliating position.\" He looked at\nher with harassed eyes. \"I'm quite sure we didn't want to fall in love\nwith one another. We're both of us very conscious of our age. Dorothy,\nas you say, is old enough to be a grandmother and I'm a baldish,\nstoutish gentleman of fifty-two. When you fall in love at twenty you\nthink your love will last for ever, but at fifty you know so much, about\nlife and about love, and you know that it will last so short a time.\"\nHis voice was low and rueful. It was as though before his mind's eye he\nsaw the sadness of autumn and the leaves falling from the trees. He\nlooked at her gravely. \"And at that age you feel that you can't afford\nto throw away the chance of happiness which a freakish destiny has given\nyou. In five years it will certainly be over, and perhaps in six months.\nLife is rather drab and grey, and happiness is so rare. We shall be dead\nso long.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt gave Mrs. Hamlyn a bitter sensation of pain to hear her husband, a\nmatter-of-fact and practical man, speak in a strain which was quite new\nto her. He had gained on a sudden a wistful and tragic personality of\nwhich she knew nothing. The twenty years during which they had lived\ntogether had no power over him and she was helpless in face of his\ndetermination. She could do nothing but go, and now, resentfully\ndetermined to get the divorce with which she had threatened him, she was\non her way to England.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe smooth sea, upon which the sun beat down so that it shone like a\nsheet of glass, was as empty and hostile as life in which there was no\nplace for her. For three days no other craft had broken in upon the\nsolitariness of that expanse. Now and again its even surface was\nscattered for the twinkling of an eye by the scurry of flying fish. The\nheat was so great that even the most energetic of passengers had given\nup deck games, and now (it was after luncheon) such as were not resting\nin their cabins lay about on chairs. Linsell strolled towards her and\nsat down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where's Mrs. Linsell?\" asked Mrs. Hamlyn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I don't know. She's about somewhere.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis indifference exasperated her. Was it possible that he did not see\nthat his wife and the surgeon were falling in love with one another?\nYet, not so very long ago, he must have cared. Their marriage had been\nromantic. They had become engaged when Mrs. Linsell was still at school\nand he little more than a boy. They must have been a charming, handsome\npair, and their youth and their mutual love must have been touching. And\nnow, after so short a time, they were tired of one another. It was\nheartbreaking. What had her husband said?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you're going to live in London when you get home?\" asked\nLinsell lazily, for something to say.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Hamlyn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was hard to reconcile herself to the fact that she had nowhere to go,\nand where she lived mattered not in the least to anyone alive. Some\nassociation of ideas made her think of Gallagher. She envied the\neagerness with which he was returning to his native land, and she was\ntouched, and at the same time amused, when she remembered the exuberant\nimagination he showed in describing the house he meant to live in and\nthe wife he meant to marry. Her friends in Yokohama, apprised in\nconfidence of her determination to divorce her husband, had assured her\nthat she would marry again. She did not much want to enter a second time\nupon a state which had once so disappointed her, and besides, most men\nwould think twice before they suggested marriage to a woman of forty.\nMr. Gallagher wanted a buxom young person.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where is Mr. Gallagher?\" she asked the submissive Linsell. \"I haven't\nseen him for the last day or two.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Didn't you know? He's ill.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor thing. What's the matter with him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's got hiccups.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hiccups don't make one ill, do they?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The surgeon is rather worried. He's tried all sorts of things, but he\ncan't stop them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How very odd.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe thought no more about it, but next morning, chancing upon the\nsurgeon, she asked him how Mr. Gallagher was. She was surprised to see\nhis boyish, cheerful face darken and grow perplexed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid he's very bad, poor chap.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"With hiccups?\" she cried in amazement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a disorder that really it was impossible to take seriously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see, he can't keep any food down. He can't sleep. He's fearfully\nexhausted. I've tried everything I can think of.\" He hesitated. \"Unless\nI can stop them soon--I don't quite know what'll happen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn was startled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But he's so strong. He seemed so full of vitality.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish you could see him now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would he like me to go and see him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come along.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGallagher had been moved from his cabin into the ship's hospital, and as\nthey approached it they heard a loud hiccup. The sound, perhaps owing to\nits connection with insobriety, had in it something ludicrous. But\nGallagher's appearance gave Mrs. Hamlyn a shock. He had lost flesh and\nthe skin hung about his neck in loose folds; under the sunburn his face\nwas pale. His eyes, before, full of fun and laughter, were haggard and\ntormented. His great body was shaken incessantly by the hiccups and now\nthere was nothing ludicrous in the sound; to Mrs. Hamlyn, for no reason\nthat she knew, it seemed strangely terrifying. He smiled when she came\nin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry to see you like this,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shan't die of it, you know,\" he gasped. \"I shall reach the green\nshores of Erin all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a man sitting beside him and he rose as they entered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is Mr. Pryce,\" said the surgeon. \"He was in charge of the\nmachinery on Mr. Gallagher's estate.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn nodded. This was the second-class passenger to whom\nGallagher had referred when they had discussed the party which was to be\ngiven on Christmas Day. He was a very small man, but sturdy, with a\npleasantly impudent countenance and an air of self-assurance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you glad to be going home?\" asked Mrs. Hamlyn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You bet I am, lady,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe intonation of the few words told Mrs. Hamlyn that he was a cockney\nand, recognising the cheerful, sensible, good-humoured and careless\ntype, her heart warmed to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not Irish?\" she smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not me, miss. London's my 'ome and I shan't be sorry to see it again, I\ncan tell you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn never thought it offensive to be called miss.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, sir, I'll be getting along,\" he said to Gallagher, with the\nbeginning of a gesture as though he were going to touch a cap which he\nhadn't got on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn asked the sick man whether she could do anything for him and\nin a minute or two left him with the doctor. The little cockney was\nwaiting outside the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can I speak to you a minute or two, miss?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe hospital cabin was aft and they stood, leaning against the rail, and\nlooked down on the well-deck where lascars and stewards off duty were\nlounging about on the covered hatches.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know exactly 'ow to begin,\" said Pryce, uncertainly, a serious\nlook strangely changing his lively, puckered face. \"I've been with Mr.\nGallagher for four years now and a better gentleman you wouldn't find in\na week of Sundays.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe hesitated again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't like it and that's the truth.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What don't you like?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if you ask me 'e's for it, and the doctor don't know it. I told\n'im, but 'e won't listen to a word I say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You mustn't be too depressed, Mr. Pryce. Of course the doctor's young,\nbut I think he's quite clever, and people don't die of hiccups, you\nknow. I'm sure Mr. Gallagher will be all right in a day or two.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know when it come on? Just as we was out of sight of land. She said\n'e'd never see 'is 'ome.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn turned and faced him. She stood a good three inches taller\nthan he.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My belief is, it's a spell been put on 'im, if you understand what I\nmean. Medicine's going to do 'im no good. You don't know them Malay\nwomen like what I do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a moment Mrs. Hamlyn was startled, and because she was startled she\nshrugged her shoulders and laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Mr. Pryce, that's nonsense.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's what the doctor said when I told 'im. But you mark my words,\n'e'll die before we see land again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe man was so serious that Mrs. Hamlyn, vaguely uneasy, was against her\nwill impressed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why should anyone cast a spell on Mr. Gallagher?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it's a bit awkward speakin' of it to a lady.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Please tell me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPryce was so embarrassed that at another time Mrs. Hamlyn would have had\ndifficulty in concealing her amusement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Gallagher's lived a long time up-country, if you understand what I\nmean, and of course it's lonely, and you know what men are, miss.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've been married for twenty years,\" she replied, smiling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I beg your pardon, ma'am. The fact is he had a Malay girl living with\nhim. I don't know 'ow long, ten or twelve years, I think. Well, when 'e\nmade up 'is mind to come 'ome for good she didn't say nothing. She just\nsat there. He thought she'd carry on no end, but she didn't. Of course\n'e provided for 'er all right, 'e gave 'er a little 'ouse for herself,\nan' 'e fixed it up so as so much should be paid 'er every month. 'E\nwasn't mean, I will say that for 'im, an' she knew all along as 'e'd be\ngoing some time. She didn't cry or anything. When 'e packed up all 'is\nthings and sent them off, she just sat there an' watched 'em go. And\nwhen 'e sold 'is furniture to the Chinks she never said a word. He'd\ngive 'er all she wanted. And when it was time for 'im to go so as to\ncatch the boat she just kep' on sitting on the steps of the bungalow,\nyou know, and she just looked an' said nothing. He wanted to say\ngood-bye to 'er, same as anyone would, an', would you believe it? she\nnever even moved. 'Aren't you going to say good-bye to me,' he says. A\nrare funny look come over 'er face. And do you know what she says? 'You\ngo,' she says; they 'ave a funny way of talking, them natives, not like\nwe 'ave, 'you go,' she says, 'but I tell you that you will never come to\nyour own country. When the land sinks into the sea, death will come upon\nyou, an' before them as goes with you sees the land again, death will\nhave took you.' It gave me quite a turn.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did Mr. Gallagher say?\" asked Mrs. Hamlyn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, well, you know what 'e is. He just laughed. 'Always merry and\nbright,' 'e says and 'e jumps into the motor, an' off we go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn saw the bright and sunny road that ran through the rubber\nestates, with their trim green trees, carefully spaced, and their\nsilence, and then wound its way up hill and down through the tangled\njungle. The car raced on, driven by a reckless Malay, with its white\npassengers, past Malay houses that stood away from the road among the\ncoconut trees, sequestered and taciturn, and through busy villages where\nthe market-place was crowded with dark-skinned little people in gay\nsarongs. Then towards evening it reached the trim, modern town, with its\nclubs and its golf links, its well-ordered rest-house, its white people,\nand its railway-station, from which the two men could take the train to\nSingapore. And the woman sat on the steps of the bungalow, empty till\nthe new manager moved in, and watched the road down which the car had\npanted, watched the car as it sped on, and watched till at last it was\nlost in the shadow of the night.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What was she like?\" Mrs. Hamlyn asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, well, to my way of thinking them Malay women are all very much\nalike, you know,\" Pryce answered. \"Of course she wasn't so young any\nmore, and you know what they are, them natives, they run to fat\nsomething terrible.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fat?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe thought, absurdly enough, filled Mrs. Hamlyn with dismay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Gallagher was always one to do himself well, if you understand what\nI mean.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe idea of corpulence at once brought Mrs. Hamlyn back to common sense.\nShe was impatient with herself because for an instant she had seemed to\naccept the little cockney's suggestion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's perfectly absurd, Mr. Pryce. Fat women can't throw spells on\npeople at a distance of a thousand miles. In fact life is very difficult\nfor a fat woman anyway.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can laugh, miss, but unless something's done, you mark my words,\nthe governor's for it. And medicine ain't goin' to save him, not white\nman's medicine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pull yourself together, Mr. Pryce. This fat lady had no particular\ngrievance against Mr. Gallagher. As these things are done in the East he\nseems to have treated her very well. Why should she wish him any harm?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We don't know 'ow they look at things. Why, a man can live there for\ntwenty years with one them natives, and d'you think 'e knows what's\ngoin' on in that black heart of hers? Not 'im!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe could not smile at his melodramatic language, for his intensity was\nimpressive. And she knew, if anyone did, that the hearts of men, whether\ntheir skins are yellow or white or brown, are incalculable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But even if she felt angry with him, even if she hated him and wanted\nto kill him, what could she do?\" It was strange that Mrs. Hamlyn with\nher questions was trying now, unconsciously, to reassure herself.\n\"There's no poison that could start working after six or seven days.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never said it was poison.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry, Mr. Pryce,\" she smiled, \"but I'm not going to believe in a\nmagic spell, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've lived in the East?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Off and on for twenty years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if you can say what they can do and what they can't, it's more\nthan I can.\" He clenched his fist and beat it on the rail with sudden,\nangry violence. \"I'm fed up with the bloody country. It's got on my\nnerves, that's what it is. We're no match for them, us white men, and\nthat's a fact. If you'll excuse me I think I'll go an' 'ave a tiddley.\nI've got the jumps.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe nodded abruptly and left her. Mrs. Hamlyn watched him, a sturdy,\nshuffling little man in shabby khaki, slither down the companion into\nthe waist of the ship, walk across it with bent head, and disappear into\nthe second-class saloon. She did not know why he left with her a vague\nuneasiness. She could not get out of her mind that picture of a stout\nwoman, no longer young, in a sarong, a coloured jacket and gold\nornaments, who sat on the steps of a bungalow looking at an empty road.\nHer heavy face was painted, but in her large, tearless eyes there was no\nexpression. The men who drove in the car were like schoolboys going home\nfor the holidays. Gallagher gave a sigh of relief. In the early morning,\nunder the bright sky, his spirits bubbled. The future was like a sunny\nroad that wandered through a wide-flung, wooded plain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLater in the day Mrs. Hamlyn asked the doctor how his patient did. The\ndoctor shook his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm done. I'm at the end of my tether.\" He frowned unhappily. \"It's\nrotten luck, striking a case like this. It would be bad enough at home,\nbut on board ship...\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was an Edinburgh man, but recently qualified, and he was taking this\nvoyage as a holiday before settling down to practice. He felt himself\naggrieved. He wanted to have a good time and, faced with this mysterious\nillness, he was worried to death. Of course he was inexperienced, but he\nwas doing everything that could be done and it exasperated him to\nsuspect that the passengers thought him an ignorant fool.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you heard what Mr. Pryce thinks?\" asked Mrs. Hamlyn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never heard such rot. I told the captain and he's right up in the\nair. He doesn't want it talked about. He thinks it'll upset the\npassengers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll be as silent as the grave.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe surgeon looked at her sharply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course you don't believe that there can be any truth in nonsense of\nthat sort?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course not.\" She looked out at the sea, which shone, blue and oily\nand still, all round them. \"I've lived in the East a long time,\" she\nadded. \"Strange things happen there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is getting on my nerves,\" said the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNear them two little Japanese gentlemen were playing deck quoits. They\nwere trim and neat in their tennis shirts, white trousers and buckram\nshoes. They looked very European, they even called the score to one\nanother in English, and yet somehow to look at them filled Mrs. Hamlyn\nat that moment with a vague disquiet. Because they seemed to wear so\neasily a disguise there was about them something sinister. Her nerves\ntoo were on edge.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd presently, no one quite knew how, the notion spread through the ship\nthat Gallagher was bewitched. While the ladies sat about on their\ndeck-chairs, stitching away at the costumes they were making for the\nfancy-dress party on Christmas Day, they gossiped about it in\nundertones, and the men in the smoking-room talked of it over their\ncocktails. A good many of the passengers had lived long in the East and\nfrom the recesses of their memory they produced strange and inexplicable\nstories. Of course it was absurd to think seriously that Gallagher was\nsuffering from a malignant spell, such things were impossible, and yet\nthis and that was a fact and no one had been able to explain it. The\ndoctor had to confess that he could suggest no cause for Gallagher's\ncondition, he was able to give a physiological explanation, but why\nthese terrible spasms should have suddenly assailed him he did not say.\nFeeling vaguely to blame, he tried to defend himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, it's the sort of case you might never come across in the whole of\nyour practice,\" he said. \"It's rotten luck.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was in wireless communication with passing ships, and suggestions for\ntreatment came from here and there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've tried everything they tell me,\" he said irritably. \"The doctor of\nthe Japanese boat advised adrenalin. How the devil does he expect me to\nhave adrenalin in the middle of the Indian Ocean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was something impressive in the thought of this ship speeding\nthrough a deserted sea, while to her from all parts came unseen\nmessages. She seemed at that moment strangely alone and yet the centre\nof the world. In the lazaret the sick man, shaken by the cruel spasms,\ngasped for life. Then the passengers became conscious that the ship's\ncourse was altered, and they heard that the captain had made up his mind\nto put in at Aden. Gallagher was to be landed there and taken to the\nhospital, where he could have attention which on board was impossible.\nThe chief engineer received orders to force his engines. The ship was an\nold one and she throbbed with the greater effort. The passengers had\ngrown used to the sound and feel of her engines, and now the greater\nvibration shook their nerves with a new sensation. It would not pass\ninto each one's unconsciousness, but beat on their sensibilities so that\neach felt a personal concern. And still the wide sea was empty of\ntraffic, so that they seemed to traverse an empty world. And now the\nuneasiness which had descended upon the ship, but which no one had been\nwilling to acknowledge, became a definite malaise. The passengers grew\nirritable, and people quarrelled over trifles which at another time\nwould have seemed insignificant. Mr. Jephson made his hackneyed jokes,\nbut no one any longer repaid him with a smile. The Linsells had an\naltercation, and Mrs. Linsell was heard late at night walking round the\ndeck with her husband and uttering in a low, tense voice a stream of\nvehement reproaches. There was a violent scene in the smoking-room one\nnight over a game of bridge, and the reconciliation which followed it\nwas attended with general intoxication. People talked little of\nGallagher, but he was seldom absent from their thoughts. They examined\nthe route map. The doctor said now that Gallagher could not live more\nthan three or four days, and they discussed acrimoniously what was the\nshortest time in which Aden could be reached. What happened to him after\nhe was landed was no affair of theirs; they did not want him to die on\nboard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn saw Gallagher every day. With the suddenness with which\nafter tropical rain in the spring you seem to see the herbage grow\nbefore your very eyes, she saw him go to pieces. Already his skin hung\nloosely on his bones, and his double chin was like the wrinkled wattle\nof a turkey-cock. His cheeks were sunken. You saw now how large his\nframe was, and through the sheet under which he lay his bony structure\nwas like the skeleton of a prehistoric giant. For the most part he lay\nwith his eyes closed, torpid with morphia, but shaken still with\nterrible spasms, and when now and again he opened his eyes they were\npreternaturally large; they looked at you vaguely, perplexed and\ntroubled, from the depths of their bony sockets. But when, emerging from\nhis stupor, he recognised Mrs. Hamlyn, he forced a gallant smile to his\nlips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How are you, Mr. Gallagher?\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Getting along, getting along. I shall be all right when we get out of\nthis confounded heat. Lord, how I look forward to a dip in the Atlantic.\nI'd give anything for a good long swim. I want to feel the cold grey sea\nof Galway beating against my chest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen the hiccup shook him from the crown of his head to the sole of his\nfoot. Mr. Pryce and the stewardess shared the care of him. The little\ncockney's face wore no longer its look of impudent gaiety, but instead\nwas sullen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The captain sent for me yesterday,\" he told Mrs. Hamlyn when they were\nalone. \"He gave me a rare talking to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What about?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He said 'e wouldn't 'ave all this hoodoo stuff. He said it was\nfrightening the passengers and I'd better keep a watch on me tongue or\nI'd 'ave 'im to reckon with. It's not my doing. I never said a word\nexcept to you and the doctor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's all over the ship.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know it is. D'you think it's only me that's saying it? All them\nLascars and the Chinese, they all know what's the matter with him. You\ndon't think you can teach them much, do you? They know it ain't a\nnatural illness.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn was silent. She knew through the amahs of some of the\npassengers that there was no one on the ship, except the whites, who\ndoubted that the woman whom Gallagher had left in distant Selantan was\nkilling him with her magic. All were convinced that as they sighted the\nbarren rocks of Arabia his soul would be parted from his body.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The captain says if he hears of me trying any hanky-panky he'll confine\nme to my cabin for the rest of the voyage,\" said Pryce, suddenly, a\nsurly frown on his puckered face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean by hanky-panky?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at her for a moment fiercely as though she too were an object\nof the anger he felt against the captain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The doctor's tried every damned thing he knows, and he's wirelessed all\nover the place, and what good 'as 'e done? Tell me that. Can't 'e see\nthe man's dying? There's only one way to save him now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's magic what's killing 'im, and it's only magic what'll save him.\nOh, don't you say it can't be done. I've seen it with me own eyes.\" His\nvoice rose, irritable and shrill. \"I've seen a man dragged from the jaws\nof death, as you might say, when they got in a <i>pawang</i>, what we call a\nwitch-doctor, an' 'e did 'is little tricks. I seen it with me own eyes,\nI tell you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn did not speak. Pryce gave her a searching look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One of them Lascars on board, he's a witch-doctor, same as the <i>pawang</i>\nthat we 'ave in the F.M.S. An' 'e says he'll do it. Only he must 'ave a\nlive animal. A cock would do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you want a live animal for?\" Mrs. Hamlyn asked, frowning a\nlittle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe cockney looked at her with quick suspicion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you take my advice you won't know anything about it. But I tell you\nwhat, I'm going to leave no stone unturned to save my governor. An' if\nthe captain 'ears of it and shuts me up in me cabin, well, let 'im.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment Mrs. Linsell came up and Pryce with his quaint gesture of\nsalute left them. Mrs. Linsell wanted Mrs. Hamlyn to fit the dress she\nhad been making herself for the fancy-dress ball, and on the way down to\nthe cabin she spoke to her anxiously of the possibility that Mr.\nGallagher might die on Christmas Day. They could not possibly have the\ndance if he did. She had told the doctor that she would never speak to\nhim again if this happened, and the doctor had promised her faithfully\nthat he would keep the man alive over Christmas Day somehow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be nice for him, too,\" said Mrs. Linsell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For whom?\" asked Mrs. Hamlyn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For poor Mr. Gallagher. Naturally no one likes to die on Christmas Day.\nDo they?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't really know,\" said Mrs. Hamlyn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat night, after she had been asleep a little while, she awoke weeping.\nIt dismayed her that she should cry in her sleep. It was as though then\nthe weakness of the flesh mastered her, and, her will broken, she were\ndefenceless against a natural sorrow. She turned over in her mind, as so\noften before, the details of the disaster which had so profoundly\naffected her; she repeated the conversations with her husband, wishing\nshe had said this and blaming herself because she had said the other.\nShe wished with all her heart that she had remained in comfortable\nignorance of her husband's infatuation, and asked herself whether she\nwould not have been wiser to pocket her pride and shut her eyes to the\nunwelcome truth. She was a woman of the world, and she knew too well how\nmuch more she lost in separating herself from her husband than his love;\nshe lost the settled establishment and the assured position, the ample\nmeans and the support of a recognised background. She had known of many\nseparated wives, living equivocally on smallish incomes, and knew how\nquickly their friends found them tiresome. And she was lonely. She was\nas lonely as the ship that throbbed her hasting way through an unpeopled\nsea, and lonely as the friendless man who lay dying in the ship's\nlazaret. Mrs. Hamlyn knew that her thoughts had got the better of her\nnow and that she would not easily sleep again. It was very hot in her\ncabin. She looked at the time; it was between four and half-past; she\nmust pass two mortal hours before broke the reassuring day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe slipped into a kimono and went on deck. The night was sombre and\nalthough the sky was unclouded no stars were visible. Panting and\nshaking, the old ship under full steam lumbered through the darkness.\nThe silence was uncanny. Mrs. Hamlyn with bare feet groped her way\nslowly along the deserted deck.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was so black that she could see nothing. She came to the end of the\npromenade deck and leaned against the rail. Suddenly she started and her\nattention was fixed, for on the lower deck she caught a fitful glow. She\nleaned forward cautiously. It was a little fire, and she saw only the\nglow because the naked backs of men, crouched round, hid the flame. At\nthe edge of the circle she divined, rather than saw, a stocky figure in\npyjamas. The rest were natives, but this was a European. It must be\nPryce and she guessed immediately that some dark ceremony of exorcism\nwas in progress. Straining her ears she heard a low voice muttering a\nstring of secret words. She began to tremble. She was aware that they\nwere too intent upon their business to think that anyone was watching\nthem, but she dared not move. Suddenly, rending the sultry silence of\nthe night like a piece of silk violently torn in two, came the crowing\nof a cock. Mrs. Hamlyn almost shrieked. Mr. Pryce was trying to save the\nlife of his friend and master by a sacrifice to the strange gods of the\nEast. The voice went on, low and insistent. Then in the dark circle\nthere was a movement, something was happening, she knew not what; there\nwas a cluck-cluck from the cock, angry and frightened, and then a\nstrange, indescribable sound; the magician was cutting the cock's\nthroat; then silence; there were vague doings that she could not follow,\nand in a little while it looked as though someone were stamping out the\nfire. The figures she had dimly seen were dissolved in the night and all\nonce more was still. She heard again the regular throbbing of the\nengines.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn stood still for a little while, strangely shaken, and then\nwalked slowly along the deck. She found a chair and lay down in it. She\nwas trembling still. She could only guess what had happened. She did not\nknow how long she lay there, but at last she felt that the dawn was\napproaching. It was not yet day, and it was no longer night. Against the\ndarkness of the sky she could now see the ship's rail. Then she saw a\nfigure come towards her. It was a man in pyjamas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who's that?\" she cried nervously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Only the doctor,\" came a friendly voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh! What are you doing here at this time of night?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've been with Gallagher.\" He sat down beside her and lit a cigarette.\n\"I've given him a good strong hypodermic and he's quiet now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Has he been very ill?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought he was going to pass out. I was watching him, and suddenly he\nstarted up on his bed and began to talk Malay. Of course I couldn't\nunderstand a thing. He kept on saying one word over and over again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps it was a name, a woman's name.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He wanted to get out of bed. He's a damned powerful man even now. By\nGeorge, I had a struggle with him. I was afraid he'd throw himself\noverboard. He seemed to think someone was calling him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When was that?\" asked Mrs. Hamlyn, slowly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Between four and half-past. Why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shuddered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLater in the morning when the ship's life was set upon its daily round,\nMrs. Hamlyn passed Pryce on the deck, but he gave her a brief greeting\nand walked on with quickly averted gaze. He looked tired and\noverwrought. Mrs. Hamlyn thought again of that fat woman, with golden\nornaments in her thick, black hair, who sat on the steps of the deserted\nbungalow and looked at the road which ran through the trim lines of the\nrubber trees.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was fearfully hot. She knew now why the night had been so dark. The\nsky was no longer blue, but a dead, level white; its surface was too\neven to give the effect of cloud; it was as though in the upper air the\nheat hung like a pall. There was no breeze and the sea, as colourless as\nthe sky, was smooth and shining like the dye in a dyer's vat. The\npassengers were listless; when they walked round the deck they panted,\nand beads of sweat broke out on their foreheads. They spoke in\nundertones. Something uncanny and disquieting brooded over the ship, and\nthey could not bring themselves to laugh. A feeling of resentment arose\nin their hearts; they were alive and well, and it exasperated them that,\nso near, a man should be dying and by the fact (which was after all no\nconcern of theirs) so mysteriously affect them. A planter in the\nsmoking-room over a gin-sling said brutally what most of them felt,\nthough none had confessed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if he's going to peg out,\" he said, \"I wish he'd hurry up and get\nit over. It gives me the creeps.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe day was interminable. Mrs. Hamlyn was thankful when the dinner hour\narrived. So much time, at all events, was passed. She sat at the\ndoctor's table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When do we reach Aden?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Some time to-morrow. The captain says we shall sight land between five\nand six in the morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a sharp look. He stared at her for a moment, then dropped\nhis eyes and reddened. He remembered that the woman, the fat woman\nsitting on the bungalow steps, had said that Gallagher would never see\nthe land. Mrs. Hamlyn wondered whether he, the sceptical, matter-of-fact\nyoung doctor, was wavering at last. He frowned a little and then, as\nthough he sought to pull himself together, looked at her once more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shan't be sorry to hand over my patient to the hospital people at\nAden, I can tell you,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext day was Christmas Eve. When Mrs. Hamlyn awoke from a troubled sleep\nthe dawn was breaking. She looked out of her port-hole and saw that the\nsky was clear and silvery; during the night the haze had melted, and the\nmorning was brilliant. With a lighter heart she went on deck. She walked\nas far forward as she could go. A late star twinkled palely close to the\nhorizon. There was a shimmer on the sea as though a loitering breeze\npassed playful fingers over its surface. The light was wonderfully soft,\ntenuous like a budding wood in spring, and crystalline so that it\nreminded you of the bubbling of water in a mountain brook. She turned to\nlook at the sun rising rosy in the east, and saw coming towards her the\ndoctor. He wore his uniform; he had not been to bed all night; he was\ndishevelled and he walked, with bowed shoulders, as though he were\ndog-tired. She knew at once that Gallagher was dead. When he came up to\nher she saw that he was crying. He looked so young then that her heart\nwent out to him. She took his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You poor dear,\" she said. \"You're tired out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I did all I could,\" he said. \"I wanted so awfully to save him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis voice shook and she saw that he was almost hysterical.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When did he die?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe closed his eyes, trying to control himself, and his lips trembled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A few minutes ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn sighed. She found nothing to say. Her gaze wandered across\nthe calm, dispassionate and ageless sea. It stretched on all sides of\nthem as infinite as human sorrow. But on a sudden her eyes were held,\nfor there, ahead of them, on the horizon was something which looked like\na precipitous and massy cloud. But its outline was too sharp to be a\ncloud's. She touched the doctor on the arm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at it for a moment and under his sunburn she saw him grow\nwhite.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Land.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOnce more Mrs. Hamlyn thought of the fat Malay woman who sat silent on\nthe steps of Gallagher's bungalow. Did she know?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey buried him when the sun was high in the heavens. They stood on the\nlower deck and on the hatches, the first- and second-class passengers,\nthe white stewards and the European officers. The missionary read the\nburial service.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full\nof misery. He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower; he fleeth as it\nwere a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPryce looked down at the deck with knit brows. His teeth were tight\nclenched. He did not grieve, for his heart was hot with anger. The\ndoctor and the consul stood side by side. The consul bore to a nicety\nthe expression of an official regret, but the doctor, clean-shaven now,\nin his neat fresh uniform and his gold braid, was pale and harassed.\nFrom him Mrs. Hamlyn's eyes wandered to Mrs. Linsell. She was pressed\nagainst her husband, weeping, and he was holding her hand tenderly. Mrs.\nHamlyn did not know why this sight singularly affected her. At that\nmoment of grief, her nerves distraught, the little woman went by\ninstinct to the protection and support of her husband. But then Mrs.\nHamlyn felt a little shudder pass through her and she fixed her eyes on\nthe seams in the deck, for she did not want to see what was toward.\nThere was a pause in the reading. There were various movements. One of\nthe officers gave an order. The missionary's voice continued.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Forasmuch as it has pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take\nunto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed: we therefore\ncommend his body to the deep, to be turned into corruption, looking for\nthe resurrection of the body when the sea shall give up its dead.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Hamlyn felt the hot tears flow down her cheeks. There was a dull\nsplash. The missionary's voice went on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen the service was finished the passengers scattered; the second-class\npassengers returned to their quarters and a bell rang to summon them to\nluncheon. But the first-class passengers sauntered aimlessly about the\npromenade deck. Most of the men made for the smoking-room and sought to\ncheer themselves with whiskies and sodas and with gin slings. But the\nconsul put up a notice on the board outside the dining-saloon summoning\nthe passengers to a meeting. Most of them had an idea for what purpose\nit was called, and at the appointed hour they assembled. They were more\ncheerful than they had been for a week and they chattered with a gaiety\nwhich was only subdued by a mannerly reserve. The consul, an eyeglass in\nhis eye, said that he had gathered them together to discuss the question\nof the fancy-dress dance on the following day. He knew they all had the\ndeepest sympathy for Mr. Gallagher and he would have proposed that they\nshould combine to send an appropriate message to the deceased's\nrelatives; but his papers had been examined by the purser and no trace\ncould be found of any relative or friend with whom it was possible to\ncommunicate. The late Mr. Gallagher appeared to be quite alone in the\nworld. Meanwhile he (the consul) ventured to offer his sincere sympathy\nto the doctor, who, he was quite sure, had done everything that was\npossible in the circumstances.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hear, hear,\" said the passengers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey had all passed through a very trying time, proceeded the consul,\nand to some it might seem that it would be more respectful to the\ndeceased's memory if the fancy-dress ball were postponed till New Year's\nEve. This, however, he told them frankly was not his view, and he was\nconvinced that Mr. Gallagher himself would not have wished it. Of course\nit was a question for the majority to decide. The doctor got up and\nthanked the consul and the passengers for the kind things that had been\nsaid of him, it had of course been a very trying time, but he was\nauthorised by the captain to say that the captain expressly wished all\nthe festivities to be carried out on Christmas Day as though nothing had\nhappened. He (the doctor) told them in confidence that the captain felt\nthe passengers had got into a rather morbid state, and thought it would\ndo them all good if they had a jolly good time on Christmas Day. Then\nthe missionary's wife rose and said they mustn't think only of\nthemselves; it had been arranged by the Entertainment Committee that\nthere should be a Christmas Tree for the children, immediately after the\nfirst-class passengers' dinner, and the children had been looking\nforward to seeing everyone in fancy-dress; it would be too bad to\ndisappoint them; she yielded to no one in her respect for the dead, and\nshe sympathised with anyone who felt too sad to think of dancing just\nthen, her own heart was very heavy, but she did feel it would be merely\nselfish to give way to a feeling which could do no good to anyone. Let\nthem think of the little ones. This very much impressed the passengers.\nThey wanted to forget the brooding terror which had hung over the boat\nfor so many days, they were alive and they wanted to enjoy themselves;\nbut they had an uneasy notion that it would be decent to exhibit a\ncertain grief. It was quite another matter if they could do as they\nwished from altruistic motives. When the consul called for a show of\nhands everyone, but Mrs. Hamlyn and one old lady who was rheumatic, held\nup an eager arm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The ayes have it,\" said the consul. \"And I venture to congratulate the\nmeeting on a very sensible decision.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was just going to break up when one of the planters got on his feet\nand said he wished to offer a suggestion. Under the circumstances didn't\nthey all think it would be as well to invite the second-class\npassengers? They had all come to the funeral that morning. The\nmissionary jumped up and seconded the motion. The events of the last few\ndays had drawn them all together, he said, and in the presence of death\nall men were equal. The consul again addressed them. This matter had\nbeen discussed at a previous meeting, and the conclusion had been\nreached that it would be pleasanter for the second-class passengers to\nhave their own party, but circumstances alter cases, and he was\ndistinctly of opinion that their previous decision should be reversed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hear, hear,\" said the passengers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA wave of democratic feeling swept over them and the motion was carried\nby acclamation. They separated light-heartedly, they felt charitable and\nkindly. Everyone stood everyone else drinks in the smoking-room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd so, on the following evening, Mrs. Hamlyn put on her fancy-dress.\nShe had no heart for the gaiety before her, and for a moment had thought\nof feigning illness, but she knew no one would believe her, and was\nafraid to be thought affected. She was dressed as Carmen and she could\nnot resist the vanity of making herself as attractive as possible. She\ndarkened her eyelashes and rouged her cheeks. The costume suited her.\nWhen the bugle sounded and she went into the saloon she was received\nwith flattering surprise. The consul (always a humorist) was dressed as\na ballet-girl and was greeted with shouts of delighted laughter. The\nmissionary and his wife, self-conscious but pleased with themselves,\nwere very grand as Manchus. Mrs. Linsell, as Columbine, showed all that\nwas possible of her very pretty legs. Her husband was an Arab sheik and\nthe doctor was a Malay sultan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA subscription had been collected to provide champagne at dinner and the\nmeal was hilarious. The company had provided crackers in which were\npaper hats of various shapes and these the passengers put on. There were\npaper streamers too which they threw at one another and little balloons\nwhich they beat from one to the other across the room. They laughed and\nshouted. They were very gay. No one could say that they were not having\na good time. As soon as dinner was finished they went into the saloon,\nwhere the Christmas Tree, with candles lit, was ready, and the children\nwere brought in, shrieking with delight, and given presents. Then the\ndance began. The second-class passengers stood about shyly round the\npart of the deck reserved for dancing and occasionally danced with one\nanother.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm glad we had them,\" said the consul, dancing with Mrs. Hamlyn. \"I'm\nall for democracy, and I think they're very sensible to keep themselves\nto themselves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut she noticed that Pryce was not to be seen, and when an opportunity\npresented asked one of the second-class passengers where he was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Blind to the world,\" was the answer. \"We put him to bed in the\nafternoon and locked him up in his cabin.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe consul claimed her for another dance. He was very facetious.\nSuddenly Mrs. Hamlyn felt that she could not bear it any more, the noise\nof the amateur band, the consul's jokes, the gaiety of the dancers. She\nknew not why, but the merriment of those people passing on their ship\nthrough the night and the solitary sea affected her on a sudden with\nhorror. When the consul released her she slipped away and, with a look\nto see that no one had noticed her, ascended the companion to the boat\ndeck. Here everything was in darkness. She walked softly to a spot where\nshe knew she would be safe from all intrusion. But she heard a faint\nlaugh and she caught sight in a hidden corner of a Columbine and a Malay\nsultan. Mrs. Linsell and the doctor had resumed already the flirtation\nwhich the death of Gallagher had interrupted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlready all those people had put out of their minds with a kind of\nferocity the thought of that poor lonely man who had so strangely died\nin their midst. They felt no compassion for him, but resentment rather,\nbecause on his account they had been ill-at-ease. They seized upon life\navidly. They made their jokes, they flirted, they gossiped. Mrs. Hamlyn\nremembered what the consul had said, that among Mr. Gallagher's papers\nno letters could be found, not the name of a single friend to whom the\nnews of his death might be sent, and she knew not why this seemed to her\nunbearably tragic. There was something mysterious in a man who could\npass through the world in such solitariness. When she remembered how he\nhad come on deck in Singapore, so short a while since, in such rude\nhealth, full of vitality, and his arrogant plans for the future, she was\nseized with dismay. Those words of the burial service filled her with a\nsolemn awe: <i>Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live,\nand is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower</i>...\nYear in, year out, he had made his plans for the future, he wanted\nto live so much and he had so much to live for, and then just when he\nstretched out his hand--oh, it was pitiful; it made all the other\ndistresses of the world of small account. Death with its mystery was the\nonly thing that really mattered. Mrs. Hamlyn leaned over the rail and\nlooked at the starry sky. Why did people make themselves unhappy? Let\nthem weep for the death of those they loved, death was terrible always,\nbut for the rest, was it worth while to be wretched, to harbour malice,\nto be vain and uncharitable? She thought again of herself and her\nhusband and the woman he so strangely loved. He too had said that we\nlive to be happy so short a time and we are so long dead. She pondered\nlong and intently, and suddenly, as summer lightning flashes across the\ndarkness of the night, she made a discovery which filled her with\ntremulous surprise; for she found that in her heart was no longer anger\nwith her husband nor jealousy of her rival. A notion dawned on some\nremote horizon of her consciousness and like the morning sun suffused\nher soul with a tender, blissful glow. Out of the tragedy of that\nunknown Irishman's death she gathered elatedly the courage for a\ndesperate resolution. Her heart beat quickly, she was impatient to carry\nit into effect. A passion for self-sacrifice seized her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe music had stopped, the ball was over; most of the passengers would\nhave gone to bed and the rest would be in the smoking-room. She went\ndown to her cabin and met no one on the way. She took her writing pad\nand wrote a letter to her husband:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n    <i>My dear. It is Christmas Day and I want to tell you that my\n    heart is filled with kindly thoughts towards both of you. I have\n    been foolish and unreasonable. I think we should allow those we\n    care for to be happy in their own way, and we should care for\n    them enough not to let it make us unhappy. I want you to know\n    that I grudge you none of the joy that has so strangely come\n    into your life. I am no longer jealous, nor hurt, nor\n    vindictive. Do not think I shall be unhappy or lonely. If ever\n    you feel that you need me, come to me, and I will welcome you\n    with a cheerful spirit and without reproach or ill-will. I am\n    most grateful for all the years of happiness and of tenderness\n    that you gave me, and in return I wish to offer you an affection\n    which makes no claim on you and is, I hope, utterly\n    disinterested. Think kindly of me and be happy, happy, happy.</i>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nShe signed her name and put the letter into an envelope. Though it would\nnot go till they reached Port Said she wanted to place it at once in the\nletter-box. When she had done this, beginning to undress, she looked at\nherself in the glass. Her eyes were shining and under her rouge her\ncolour was bright. The future was no longer desolate, but bright with a\nfair hope. She slipped into bed and fell at once into a sound and\ndreamless sleep.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nIt was quite a small party, because our hostess liked general\nconversation; we never sat down to dinner more than eight, and generally\nonly six, and after dinner when we went up to the drawing-room the\nchairs were so arranged that it was impossible for two persons to go\ninto a huddle in a corner and so break things up. I was glad on arriving\nto find that I knew everyone. There were two nice clever women besides\nour hostess and two men besides myself. One was my friend Ned Preston.\nOur hostess made it a point never to ask wives with their husbands,\nbecause she said each cramped the other's style and if they didn't like\nto come separately they needn't come at all. But since her food and her\nwine were good and the talk almost always entertaining they generally\ncame. People sometimes accused her of asking husbands more often than\nwives, but she defended herself by saying that she couldn't possibly\nhelp it because more men were husbands than women were wives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNed Preston was a Scot, a good-humoured, merry soul, with a gift for\ntelling a story, sometimes too lengthily, for he was uncommonly\nloquacious, but with dramatic intensity. He was a bachelor with a small\nincome which sufficed for his modest needs, and in this he was lucky\nsince he suffered from that form of chronic tuberculosis which may last\nfor years without killing you, but which prevents you from working for\nyour living. Now and then he would be ill enough to stay in bed for two\nor three weeks, but then he would get better and be as gay, cheerful and\ntalkative as ever. I doubt whether he had enough money to live in an\nexpensive sanatorium and he certainly hadn't the temperament to suit\nhimself to its life. He was worldly. When he was well he liked to go\nout, out to lunch, out to dinner, and he liked to sit up late into the\nnight smoking his pipe and drinking a good deal of whisky. If he had\nbeen content to live the life of an invalid he might have been alive\nnow, but he wasn't; and who can blame him? He died at the age of\nfifty-five of a hæmorrhage which he had one night after coming home from\nsome house where, he may well have flattered himself, he was the success\nof the party.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had that febrile vitality that some consumptives have, and was always\nlooking for an occupation to satisfy his desire for activity. I don't\nknow how he heard that at Wormwood Scrubs they were in want of prison\nvisitors, but the idea took his fancy so he went to the Home Office and\nsaw the official in charge of prisons to offer his services. The job is\nunpaid, and though a number of persons are willing to undertake it,\neither from compassion or curiosity, they are apt to grow tired of it,\nor find it takes up too much time, and the prisoners whose problems,\ninterests and future they have been concerned with are left somewhat in\nthe lurch. The Home Office people consequently are wary of taking on\nanyone who does not look as if he would persevere, and they make careful\ninquiries into the applicant's antecedents, character and general\nsuitability. Then he is given a trial, is discreetly watched, and if the\nimpression is unfavourable is politely thanked and told that his\nservices are no longer required. But Ned Preston satisfied the dour and\nshrewd official who interviewed him that he was in every way reliable,\nand from the beginning he got on well with the governor, the warders and\nthe prisoners. He was entirely lacking in class-consciousness, so\nprisoners, whatever their station in life, felt at ease with him. He\nneither preached nor moralised. He had never done a criminal, or even a\nmean, thing in his life, but he treated the crime of the prisoners he\nhad to deal with as though it were an illness like his own tuberculosis\nwhich was a nuisance you had to put up with, but which it did no good to\ntalk about.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWormwood Scrubs is a first offenders' prison and it is a building, grim\nand cold, of forbidding appearance. Ned took me over it once and I had\ngoose-flesh as the gates were unlocked for us and we went in. We passed\nthrough the halls in which the men were working.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you see any pals of yours take no notice of them,\" Ned said to me.\n\"They don't like it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Am I likely to see any pals of mine?\" I asked dryly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You never can tell. I shouldn't be surprised if you had had friends\nwho'd passed bad cheques once too often or were caught in a compromising\nsituation in one of the parks. You'd be surprised how often I run across\nchaps I've met out at dinner.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne of Ned's duties was to see prisoners through the first difficult\ndays of their confinement. They were often badly shaken by their trial\nand sentence; and when, after the preliminary proceedings they had to go\nthrough on entering the jail, the stripping, the bath, the medical\nexamination and the questioning, the getting into prison clothes, they\nwere led into a cell and locked up, they were apt to break down.\nSometimes they cried hysterically; sometimes they could neither eat nor\nsleep. Ned's business then was to cheer them, and his breezy manner, his\nnatural kindliness, often worked wonders. If they were anxious about\ntheir wives and children he would go to see them and if they were\ndestitute provide them with money. He brought them news so that they\nmight get over the awful feeling that they were shut away from the\ncommon interests of their fellow-men. He read the sporting papers to be\nable to tell them what horse had won an important race or whether the\nchampion had won his fight. He would advise them about their future, and\nwhen the time approached for their release see what jobs they were\nfitted for and then persuade employers to give them a chance to make\ngood.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSince everyone is interested in crime it was inevitable that sooner or\nlater, with Ned there, the conversation should turn upon it. It was\nafter dinner and we were sitting comfortably in the drawing-room with\ndrinks in our hands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Had any interesting cases at the Scrubs lately, Ned?\" I asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, nothing much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had a high, rasping voice and his laugh was a raucous cackle. He\nbroke into it now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I went to see an old girl to-day who was a packet of fun. Her husband's\na burglar. The police have known about him for years, but they've never\nbeen able to get him till just now. Before he did a job he and his wife\nconcocted an alibi, and though he's been arrested three or four times\nand sent up for trial, the police have never been able to break it and\nhe's always got off. Well, he was arrested again a little while ago, but\nhe wasn't upset, the alibi he and his wife had made up was perfect and\nhe expected to be acquitted as he'd been before. His wife went into the\nwitness-box and to his utter amazement she didn't give the alibi and he\nwas convicted. I went to see him. He wasn't so much worried at being in\ngaol as puzzled by his wife not having spoken up, and he asked me to go\nand see her and ask what the game was. Well I went, and d'you know what\nshe said to me? She said: 'Well, sir, it's like this; it was such a\nbeautiful alibi I just couldn't bear to waste it.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course we all laughed. The story-teller likes an appreciative\naudience, and Ned Preston was never disinclined to hold the floor. He\nnarrated two or three more anecdotes. They tended to prove a point he\nwas fond of making, that in what till we all got democratic in England\nwere called the lower orders there was more passion, more romance, more\ndisregard of consequences than could ever be found in the well-to-do and\npresumably educated classes, whom prudence has made timid and convention\ninhibited.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Because the working man doesn't read much,\" he said, \"because he has no\ngreat gift for expressing himself, you think he has no imagination.\nYou're wrong. He's extravagantly imaginative. Because he's a great husky\nbrute you think he has no nerves. You're wrong again. He's a bundle of\nnerves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he told us a story which I shall tell as best I can in my own\nwords.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFred Manson was a good-looking fellow, tall, well-made, with blue eyes,\ngood features and a friendly, agreeable smile, but what made him\nremarkable so that people turned round in the streets to stare at him\nwas that he had a thick head of hair, with a great wave in it, of a deep\nrich red. It was really a great beauty. Perhaps it was this that gave\nhim so sensual a look. His maleness was like a heady perfume. His\neyebrows were thick, only a little lighter than his hair, and he was\nlucky enough not to have the ugly skin that so often disfigures\nred-heads. His was a smooth olive. His eyes were bold, and when he\nsmiled or laughed, which in the healthy vitality of his youth he did\nconstantly, his expression was wonderfully alluring. He was twenty-two\nand he gave you the rather pleasant impression of just loving to be\nalive. It was inevitable that with such looks and above all with that\ntroubling sexuality he should have success with women. He was charming,\ntender and passionate, but immensely promiscuous. He was not exactly\ncallous or brazen, he had a kindly nature, but somehow or other he made\nit quite clear to the objects of his passing fancy that all he wanted\nwas a little bit of fun and that it was impossible for him to remain\nfaithful to anyone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFred was a postman. He worked in Brixton. It is a densely populated part\nof London, and has the curious reputation of harbouring more criminals\nthan any other suburb because trams run to it from across the river all\nnight long, so that when a man has done a job of housebreaking in the\nWest End he can be sure of getting home without difficulty. Fred liked\nhis job. Brixton is a district of innumerable streets lined with little\nhouses inhabited by the people who work in the neighbourhood and also by\nclerks, shop-assistants, skilled workers of one sort or another whose\njobs take them every day across the river. He was strong and healthy and\nit was a pleasure to him to walk from street to street delivering the\nletters. Sometimes there would be a postal packet to hand in or a\nregistered letter that had to be signed for, and then he would have the\nopportunity of seeing people. He was a sociable creature. It was never\nlong before he was well known on whatever round he was assigned to.\nAfter a time his job was changed. His duty then was to go to the red\npillar-boxes into which the letters were put, empty them, and take the\ncontents to the main post-office of the district. His bag would be\npretty heavy sometimes by the time he was through, but he was proud of\nhis strength and the weight only made him laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne day he was emptying a box in one of the better streets, a street of\nsemi-detached houses, and had just closed his bag when a girl came\nrunning along.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Postman,\" she cried, \"take this letter, will you. I want it to go by\nthis post most particularly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave her his good-natured smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never mind obliging a lady,\" he said, putting down his bag and\nopening it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't trouble you, only it's urgent,\" she said as she handed him\nthe letter she had in her hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is it to--a feller?\" he grinned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"None of your business.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right, be haughty. But I tell you this, he's no good. Don't you\ntrust him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've got a nerve,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So they tell me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took off his cap and ran his hand through his mop of curling red\nhair. The sight of it made her gasp.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where d'you get your perm?\" she asked with a giggle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll show you one of these days if you like.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was looking down at her with his amused eyes, and there was something\nabout him that gave her a funny little feeling in the pit of her\nstomach.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I must be on my way,\" he said. \"If I don't get on with the job\npretty damn quick I don't know what'll happen to the country.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not detaining you,\" she said coolly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's where you make a mistake,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave her a look that made her heart beat nineteen to the dozen and\nshe felt herself blushing all over. She turned away and ran back to the\nhouse. Fred noticed it was four doors away from the pillar-box. He had\nto pass it and as he did so he looked up. He saw the net curtains twitch\nand knew she was watching. He felt pleased with himself. During the next\nfew days he looked at the house whenever he passed it, but never caught\na glimpse of the girl. One afternoon he ran across her by chance just as\nhe was entering the street in which she lived.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa,\" he said, stopping.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe blushed scarlet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Haven't seen you about lately.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You haven't missed much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's what you think.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was prettier than he remembered, dark-haired, dark-eyed, rather\ntall, slight, with a good figure, a pale skin and very white teeth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What about coming to the pictures with me one evening?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Taking a lot for granted, aren't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It pays,\" he said with his impudent, charming grin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe couldn't help laughing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not with me, it doesn't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, come on. One's only young once.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was something so attractive in him that she couldn't bring herself\nto give him a saucy answer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I couldn't really. My people wouldn't like me going out with a fellow I\ndon't know. You see, I'm the only one they have and they think a rare\nlot of me. Why, I don't even know your name.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I can tell you, can't I? Fred. Fred Manson. Can't you say you're\ngoing to the pictures with a girl friend?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe had never felt before what she was feeling then. She didn't know if\nit was pain or pleasure. She was strangely breathless.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose I could do that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey fixed the night, the time and the place. Fred was waiting for her\nand they went in, but when the picture started and he put his arm round\nher waist, without a word, her eyes fixed on the screen, she quietly\ntook it away. He took hold of her hand, but she withdrew it. He was\nsurprised. That wasn't the way girls usually behaved. He didn't know\nwhat one went to the pictures for if it wasn't to have a bit of a\ncuddle. He walked home with her after the show. She told him her name.\nGrace Carter. Her father had a shop of his own in the Brixton Road, he\nwas a draper and he had four assistants.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He must be doing well,\" said Fred.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He doesn't complain.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGracie was a student at London University. When she got her degree she\nwas going to be a school teacher.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What d'you want to do that for when there's a good business waiting for\nyou?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pa doesn't want me to have anything to do with the shop--not after the\neducation he's given me. He wants me to better myself, if you know what\nI mean.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer father had started life as an errand boy, then become a draper's\nassistant and because he was hard-working, honest and intelligent was\nnow owner of a prosperous little business. Success had given him grand\nideas for his only child. He didn't want her to have anything to do with\ntrade. He hoped she'd marry a professional man perhaps, or at least\nsomeone in the City. Then he'd sell the business and retire, and Gracie\nwould be quite the lady.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen they reached the corner of her street Gracie held out her hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd better not come to the door,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Aren't you going to kiss me good-night?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Because I don't want to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll come to the pictures again, won't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I'd better not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, come on.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was such a warm urgency in his voice that she felt as though her\nknees would give way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you behave if I do?\" He nodded. \"Promise?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Swop me bob.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe scratched his head when he left her. Funny girl. He'd never met\nanyone quite like her. Superior, there was no doubt about that. There\nwas something in her voice that got you. It was warm and soft. He tried\nto think what it was like. It was like as if the words kissed you.\nSounded silly, that did, but that's just what it was like.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFrom then on they went to the pictures once or twice a week. After a\nwhile she allowed him to put his arm round her waist and to hold her\nhand, but she never let him go farther than that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you ever been kissed by a fellow?\" he asked her once.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I haven't,\" she said simply. \"My ma's funny, she says you've got to\nkeep a man's respect.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd give anything in the world just to kiss you, Gracie.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be so silly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Won't you let me just once?\" She shook her head. \"Why not?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Because I like you too much,\" she said hoarsely, and then walked\nquickly away from him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt gave him quite a turn. He wanted her as he'd never wanted a woman\nbefore. What she'd said finished him. He'd been thinking of her a lot,\nand he'd looked forward to the evenings they spent together as he'd\nnever looked forward to anything in his life. For the first time he was\nuncertain of himself. She was above him in every way, what with her\nfather making money hand over fist and her education and everything, and\nhim only a postman. They had made a date for the following Friday night\nand he was in a fever of anxiety lest she shouldn't come. He repeated to\nhimself over and over again what she'd said: perhaps it meant that she'd\nmade up her mind to drop him. When at last he saw her walking along the\nstreet he almost sobbed with relief. That evening he neither put his arm\nround her nor took her hand and when he walked her home he never said a\nword.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're very quiet to-night, Fred,\" she said at last. \"What's the matter\nwith you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe walked a few steps before he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't like to tell you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe stopped suddenly and looked up at him. There was terror on her face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell me whatever it is,\" she said unsteadily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm gone, I can't help myself, I'm so stuck on you I can't see\nstraight. I didn't know what it was to love like I love you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, is that all? You gave me such a fright. I thought you were going to\nsay you were going to be married.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Me? Who d'you take me for? It's you I want to marry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what's to prevent you, silly?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gracie! D'you mean it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe flung his arms round her and kissed her full on the mouth. She didn't\nresist. She returned his kiss and he felt in her a passion as eager as\nhis own.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey arranged that Gracie should tell her parents that she was engaged\nto him and that on the Sunday he should come and be introduced to them.\nSince the shop stayed open late on Saturday and by the time Mr. Carter\ngot home he was tired out, it was not till after dinner on Sunday that\nGracie broke her news. George Carter was a brisk, not very tall man, but\nsturdy, with a high colour, who with increasing prosperity had put on\nweight. He was more than rather bald and he had a bristle of grey\nmoustache. Like many another employer who has risen from the working\nclass he was a slave-driver and he got as much work out of his\nassistants for as little money as was possible. He had an eye for\neverything and he wouldn't put up with any nonsense, but he was\nreasonable and even kindly, so that they did not dislike him. Mrs.\nCarter was a quiet, nice woman, with a pleasant face and the remains of\ngood looks. They were both in the early fifties, for they had married\nlate after \"walking out\" for nearly ten years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were very much surprised when Gracie told them what she had to\ntell, but not displeased.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are a sly one,\" said her father. \"Why, I never suspected for a\nminute you'd taken up with anyone. Well, I suppose it had to come sooner\nor later. What's his name?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fred Manson.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A fellow you met at college?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. You must have seen him about. He clears our pillar-box. He's a\npostman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Gracie,\" cried Mrs. Carter, \"you can't mean it. You can't marry a\ncommon postman, not after all the education we've given you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor an instant Mr. Carter was speechless. He got redder in the face than\never.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your ma's right, my girl,\" he burst out now. \"You can't throw yourself\naway like that. Why, it's ridiculous.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not throwing myself away. You wait till you see him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Carter began to cry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's such a come-down. It's such a humiliation. I shall never be able\nto hold up my head again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Ma, don't talk like that. He's a nice fellow and he's got a good\njob.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't understand,\" she moaned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How d'you get to know him?\" Mr. Carter interrupted. \"What sort of a\nfamily's he got?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"His pa drives one of the post-office vans,\" Gracie answered defiantly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Working-class people.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what of it? His pa's worked twenty-four years for the post-office\nand they think a lot of him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Carter was biting the corner of her handkerchief.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gracie, I want to tell you something. Before your pa and me got married\nI was in domestic service. He wouldn't ever let me tell you because he\ndidn't want you to be ashamed of me. That's why we was engaged all those\nyears. The lady I was with said she'd leave me something in her will if\nI stayed with her till she passed away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was that money that gave me my start,\" Mr. Carter broke in. \"Except\nfor that I'd never have been where I am to-day. And I don't mind telling\nyou your ma's the best wife a man ever had.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never had a proper education,\" Mrs. Carter went on, \"but I always was\nambitious. The proudest moment of my life was when your pa said we could\nafford a girl to help me and he said then: 'The time'll come when you\nhave a cook and a house-maid,' and he's been as good as his word, and\nnow you're going back to what I come from. I'd set my heart on your\nmarrying a gentleman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe began crying again. Gracie loved her parents and couldn't bear to\nsee them so distressed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry, Ma, I knew it would be a disappointment to you, but I can't\nhelp it, I can't really. I love him so, I love him so terribly. I'm sure\nyou'll like him when you see him. We're going for a walk on the Common\nthis afternoon. Can't I bring him back to supper?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Carter gave her husband a harassed look. He sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't like it and it's no good pretending I do, but I suppose we'd\nbetter have a look at him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSupper passed off better than might have been expected. Fred wasn't shy,\nand he talked to Gracie's parents as though he had known them all his\nlife. If to be waited on by a maid, if to sup in a dining-room furnished\nin solid mahogany and afterwards to sit in a drawing-room that had a\ngrand piano in it was new to him, he showed no embarrassment. After he\nhad gone and they were alone in their bedroom Mr. and Mrs. Carter talked\nhim over.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He is handsome, you can't deny that,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Handsome is as handsome does. D'you think he's after her money?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, he must know that you've got a tidy little bit tucked away\nsomewhere, but he's in love with her all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, what makes you think that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, you've only got to see the way he looks at her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, that's something at all events.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the end the Carters withdrew their opposition on the condition that\nthe young things shouldn't marry until Gracie had taken her degree. That\nwould give them a year, and at the back of their minds was the hope that\nby then she would have changed her mind. They saw a good deal of Fred\nafter that. He spent every Sunday with them. Little by little they began\nquite to like him. He was so easy, so gay, so full of high spirits, and\nabove all so obviously head over ears in love with Gracie, that Mrs.\nCarter soon succumbed to his charm, and after a while even Mr. Carter\nwas prepared to admit that he didn't seem a bad fellow. Fred and Gracie\nwere happy. She went to London every day to attend lectures and worked\nhard. They spent blissful evenings together. He gave her a very nice\nengagement ring and often took her out to dinner in the West End and to\na play. On fine Sundays he drove her out into the country in a car that\nhe said a friend had lent him. When she asked him if he could afford all\nthe money he spent on her he laughed, and said a chap had given him a\ntip on an outsider and he'd made a packet. They talked interminably of\nthe little flat they would have when they were married and the fun it\nwould be to furnish it. They were more in love with one another than\never.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen the blow fell. Fred was arrested for stealing money from the\nletters he collected. Many people, to save themselves the trouble of\nbuying postal orders, put notes in their envelopes, and it wasn't\ndifficult to tell that they were there. Fred went up for trial, pleaded\nguilty, and was sentenced to two years' hard labour. Gracie went to the\ntrial. Up to the last moment she had hoped that he would be able to\nprove his innocence. It was a dreadful shock to her when he pleaded\nguilty. She was not allowed to see him. He went straight from the dock\nto the prison van. She went home and, locking herself up in her bedroom,\nthrew herself on the bed and wept. When Mr. Carter came back from the\nshop Gracie's mother went up to her room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gracie, you're to come downstairs,\" she said. \"Your father wants to\nspeak to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGracie got up and went down. She did not trouble to dry her eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Seen the paper?\" he said, holding out to her the <i>Evening News</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe didn't answer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, that's the end of that young man,\" he went on harshly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey too, Gracie's parents, had been shocked when Fred was arrested, but\nshe was so distressed, she was so convinced that everything could be\nexplained, that they hadn't had the heart to tell her that she must have\nnothing more to do with him. But now they felt it time to have things\nout with her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So that's where the money came from for those dinners and theatres. And\nthe car. I thought it funny he should have a friend who'd lend him a car\non Sundays when he'd be wanting it himself. He hired it, didn't he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose so,\" she answered miserably. \"I just believed what he told\nme.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've had a lucky escape, my girl, that's all I can say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He only did it because he wanted to give me a good time. He didn't want\nme to think I couldn't have everything as nice when I was with him as\nwhat I've been used to at home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not going to make excuses for him, I hope. He's a thief, that's\nwhat he is.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't care,\" she said sullenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't care? What d'you mean by that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Exactly what I say. I'm going to wait for him and the moment he comes\nout I'm going to marry him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Carter gave a gasp of horror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gracie, you can't do a thing like that,\" she cried. \"Think of the\ndisgrace. And what about us? We've always held our heads high. He's a\nthief, and once a thief always a thief.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't go on calling him a thief,\" Gracie shrieked, stamping her foot\nwith rage. \"What he did he did just because he loved me. I don't care if\nhe is a thief. I love him more than ever I loved him. You don't know\nwhat love is. You waited ten years to marry Pa just so as an old woman\nshould leave you some money. D'you call that love?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You leave your ma out of this,\" Mr. Carter shouted. Then an idea\noccurred to him and he gave her a piercing glance. \"Have you got to\nmarry the feller?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGracie blushed furiously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. There's never been anything of that sort. And not through any fault\nof mine either. He loved me too much. He didn't want to do anything\nperhaps he'd regret afterwards.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOften on summer evenings in the country when they'd been lying in a\nfield in one another's arms, mouth to mouth, her desire had been as\nintense as his. She knew how much he wanted her and she was ready to\ngive him what he asked. But when things got too desperate he'd suddenly\njump up and say:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come on, let's walk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe'd drag her to her feet. She knew what was in his mind. He wanted to\nwait till they were married. His love had given him a delicacy of\nsentiment that he'd never known before. He couldn't make it out himself,\nbut he had a funny sort of feeling about her, he felt that if he had her\nbefore marriage it would spoil things. Because she guessed what was in\nhis heart she loved him all the more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what's come over you,\" moaned Mrs. Carter. \"You was always\nsuch a good girl. You've never given us a day's uneasiness.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Stop it, Ma,\" said Mr. Carter violently. \"We've got to get this\nstraight once and for all. You've got to give up this man, see? I've got\nme own position to think of and if you think I'm going to have a\ngaol-bird for a son-in-law you'd better think again. I've had enough of\nthis nonsense. You've got to promise me that you'll have nothing more to\ndo with the feller ever.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you think I'm going to give him up now? How often d'you want me to\ntell you I'm going to marry him the moment he gets out?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right, then you can get out of my house and get out pretty damn\nquick. And stay out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pa!\" cried Mrs. Carter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shut up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll be glad to go,\" said Gracie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, will you? And how d'you think you're going to live?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can work, can't I? I can get a job at Payne & Perkins. They'll be\nglad to have me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Gracie, you couldn't go and work in a shop. You can't demean\nyourself like that,\" said Mrs. Carter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you shut up, Ma,\" shouted Mr. Carter, beside himself now with\nrage. \"Work, will you? You that's never done a stroke of work in your\nlife except that tomfoolery at the college. Bright idea it was of your\nma's to give you an education. Fat lot of good it'll be to you when\nyou've got to stand on your feet for hours and got to be civil and\npleasant to a lot of old trouts who just try and give you all the\ntrouble they can just to show how superior they are. I bet you'll like\nit when you're bawled out by the manageress because you're not bright\nand snappy. All right, marry your gaol-bird. I suppose you know you'll\nhave to keep him too. You don't think anyone's going to give him a job,\ndo you, not with his record. Get out, get out, get out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had worked himself up to such a pitch of fury that he sank panting\ninto a chair. Mrs. Carter, frightened, poured out a glass of water and\ngave him some to drink. Gracie slipped out of the room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext day, when her father had gone to work and her mother was out\nshopping, she left the house with such effects as she could get into a\nsuit-case. Payne & Perkins was a large department store in the Brixton\nRoad, and with her good appearance and pleasant manner she found no\ndifficulty in getting taken on. She was put in the ladies' lingerie. For\na few days she stayed at the Y.W.C.A. and then arranged to share a room\nwith one of the girls who worked with her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNed Preston saw Fred in the evening of the day he went to gaol. He found\nhim shattered, but only because of Gracie. He took his thieving very\nlightly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I had to do the right thing by her, didn't I? Her people, they didn't\nthink I was good enough for her; I wanted to show them I was just as\ngood as they were. When we went up to the West End I couldn't give her a\nsandwich and half of bitter in a pub, why, she's never been in a pub in\nher life, I <i>had</i> to take her to a restaurant. If people are such fools\nas to put money in letters, well, they're just asking for it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he was frightened. He wasn't sure that Gracie would see it like\nthat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got to know what she's going to do. If she chucks me now--well,\nit's the end of everything for me, see? I'll find some way of doing\nmeself in, I swear to God I will.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe told Ned the whole story of his love for Gracie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I could have had her over and over again if I'd wanted to. And I did\nwant to and so did she. I knew that. But I respected her, see? She's not\nlike other girls. She's one in a thousand, I tell you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe talked and talked. He stormed, he wept. From that confused torrent of\nwords emerged one thing very clearly. A passionate, a frenzied love. Ned\npromised that he would see the girl.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell her I love her, tell her that what I did I just did because I\nwanted her to have the best of everything, and tell her I just can't\nlive without her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs soon as he could find time Ned Preston went to the Carters' house,\nbut when he asked for Gracie the maid who opened the door told him that\nshe didn't live there any more. Then he asked to see her mother.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll go and see if she's in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave the maid his card, thinking the name of his club engraved in the\ncorner would impress Mrs. Carter enough to make her willing to see him.\nThe maid left him at the door, but in a minute or two asked him to come\nin. He was shown into the stiff and little-used sitting-room. Mrs.\nCarter kept him waiting for some time and when she came in, holding his\ncard in the tips of her fingers, he guessed it was because she had\nthought fit to change her dress. The black silk she wore was evidently a\ndress for occasions. He told her his connection with Wormwood Scrubs and\nsaid that he had to do with a man named Frederick Manson. The moment he\nmentioned the name Mrs. Carter assumed a hostile attitude.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't speak to me of that man,\" she cried. \"A thief, that's what he is.\nThe trouble he's caused us. They ought to have given him five years,\nthey ought.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry he's caused you trouble,\" said Ned mildly. \"Perhaps if you'd\ngive me a few facts I might help to straighten things out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNed Preston certainly had a way with him. Perhaps Mrs. Carter was\nimpressed because he was a gentleman. \"Class he is,\" she probably said\nto herself. Anyhow it was not long before she was telling him the whole\nstory. She grew upset as she told it and began to cry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And now she's gone and left us. Run away. I don't know how she could\nbring herself to do a thing like that. God knows, we love her. She's all\nwe've got and we done everything in the world for her. Her pa never\nmeant it when he told her to get out of the house. Only she was so\nobstinate. He got in a temper, he always was a quick-tempered man, he\nwas just as upset as I was when we found she'd gone. And d'you know\nwhat's she's been and gone and done? Got herself a job at Payne &\nPerkins. Mr. Carter can't abide them. Cutting prices all the time they\nare. Unfair competition, he calls it. And to think of our Gracie working\nwith a lot of shop-girls--oh, it's so humiliating.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNed made a mental note of the store's name. He hadn't been at all sure\nof getting Gracie's address out of Mrs. Carter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you seen her since she left you?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I have. I knew they'd jump at her at Payne & Perkins, a\nsuperior girl like that, and I went there, and there she was, sure\nenough--in the ladies' lingerie. I waited outside till closing time and\nthen I spoke to her. I asked her to come home. I said her pa was willing\nto let bygones be bygones. And d'you know what she said? She said she'd\ncome home if we never said a word against Fred and if we was prepared to\nhave her marry him as soon as ever he got out. Of course I had to tell\nher pa. I never saw him in such a state, I thought he was going to have\na fit, he said he'd rather see her dead at his feet than married to that\ngaol-bird.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Carter again burst into tears and as soon as he could Ned Preston\nleft her. He went to the department store, up to the ladies' lingerie,\nand asked for Grace Carter. She was pointed out to him and he went up to\nher.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can I speak to you for a minute? I've come from Fred Manson.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe went deathly white. For a moment it seemed that she could not utter\na word.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Follow me, please.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe took him into a passage smelling of disinfectants which seemed to\nlead to the lavatories. They were alone. She stared at him anxiously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He sends you his love. He's worried about you. He's afraid you're\nawfully unhappy. What he wants to know really is if you're going to\nchuck him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Me?\" Her eyes filled with tears, but on her face was a look of ecstasy.\n\"Tell him that nothing matters to me as long as he loves me. Tell him\nI'd wait twenty years for him if I had to. Tell him I'm counting the\ndays till he gets out so as we can get married.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor fear of the manageress she couldn't stay away from her work for more\nthan a minute or two. She gave Ned all the loving messages she could get\ninto the time to give Fred Manson. Ned didn't get to the Scrubs till\nnearly six. The prisoners are allowed to put down their tools at\nfive-thirty and Fred had just put his down. When Ned entered the cell he\nturned pale and sank on to the bed as though his anxiety was such that\nhe didn't trust his legs. But when Ned told him his news he gave a gasp\nof relief. For a while he couldn't trust himself to speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I knew you'd seen her the moment you came in. I smelt her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sniffed as though the smell of her body were strong in his nostrils,\nand his face was as it were a mask of desire. His features on a sudden\nseemed strangely blurred.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, it made me feel quite uncomfortable so that I had to look the\nother way,\" said Ned Preston when he told us this, with a cackle of his\nshrill laughter. \"It was sex in its nakedness all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFred was an exemplary prisoner. He worked well, he gave no trouble. Ned\nsuggested books for him to read and he took them out of the library, but\nthat was about as far as he got.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't get on well with them somehow,\" he said. \"I start reading and\nthen I begin thinking of Gracie. You know, when she kisses you\nordinary-like--oh, it's so sweet, but when she kisses you really, my\nGod, it's lovely.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFred was allowed to see Gracie once a month, but their meetings, with a\nglass screen between, under the eyes of a warder, were so painful that\nafter several visits they agreed it would be better if she didn't come\nany more. A year passed. Owing to his good behaviour he could count on a\nremittance of his sentence and so would be free in another six months.\nGracie had saved every penny she could out of her wages and now as the\ntime approached for Fred's release she set about getting a home ready\nfor him. She took two rooms in a house and furnished them on the hire\npurchase system. One room of course was to be their bedroom and the\nother the living-room and kitchen. There was an old-fashioned range in\nit and this she had taken out and replaced by a gas-stove. She wanted\neverything to be nice and new and clean and comfortable. She took pains\nto make the two little rooms bright and pretty. To do all this she had\nto go without all but the barest necessities of existence and she grew\nthin and pale. Ned suspected that she was starving herself and when he\nwent to see her took a box of chocolates or a cake so that she should\nhave at least something to eat. He brought the prisoner news of what\nGracie was doing and she made him promise to give him accurate accounts\nof every article she bought. He took fond, more than fond, passionate\nmessages from one to the other. He was convinced that Fred would go\nstraight in future and he got him a job as commissionaire from a firm\nthat had a chain of restaurants in London. The wages were good and by\ncalling taxis or fetching cars he would be able to make money on the\nside. He was to start work as soon as he came out of gaol. Gracie took\nthe necessary steps so that they could get married at once. The eighteen\nmonths of Fred's imprisonment were drawing to an end. Gracie was in a\nfever of excitement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt happened then that Ned Preston had one of his periodical bouts of\nillness and was unable to go to the prison for three weeks. It bothered\nhim, for he didn't like to abandon his prisoners, so as soon as he could\nget out of bed he went to the Scrubs. The chief warder told him that\nManson had been asking for him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think you'd better go and see him. I don't know what's the matter\nwith him. He's been acting rather funny since you've been away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was just a fortnight before Fred was due to be released. Ned Preston\nwent to his cell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Fred, how are you?\" he asked. \"Sorry I haven't been able to come\nand see you. I've been ill, and I haven't been able to see Gracie\neither. She must be all of a dither by now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I want you to go and see her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis manner was so surly that Ned was taken aback. It was unlike him to\nbe anything but pleasant and civil.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course I will.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want you to tell her that I'm not going to marry her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNed was so astounded that for a minute he could only stare blankly at\nFred Manson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What on earth d'you mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Exactly what I say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't let her down now. Her people have thrown her out. She's been\nworking all this time to get a home ready for you. She's got the licence\nand everything.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't care. I'm not going to marry her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But why, why, why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNed was flabbergasted. Fred Manson was silent for a bit. His face was\ndark and sullen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll tell you. I've thought about her night and day for eighteen months\nand now I'm sick to death of her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ned Preston reached this point of his story our hostess and our\nfellow guests broke into loud laughter. He was plainly taken aback.\nThere was some little talk after that and the party broke up. Ned and I,\nhaving to go in the same direction, walked along Piccadilly together.\nFor a time we walked in silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I noticed you didn't laugh with the others,\" he said abruptly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't think it funny.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What d'you make of it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I can see his point, you know. Imagination's an odd thing, it\ndries up; I suppose, thinking of her incessantly all that time he'd\nexhausted every emotion she could give him, and I think it was quite\nliterally true, he'd just got sick to death of her. He'd squeezed the\nlemon dry and there was nothing to do but throw away the rind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't think it funny either. That's why I didn't tell them the rest\nof the story. I wouldn't accept it at first. I thought it was just\nhysteria or something. I went to see him two or three days running. I\nargued with him. I really did my damnedest. I thought if he'd only see\nher it would be all right, but he wouldn't even do that. He said he\nhated the sight of her. I couldn't move him. At last I had to go and\ntell her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe walked on a little longer in silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I saw her in that beastly, stinking corridor. She saw at once there was\nsomething the matter and she went awfully white. She wasn't a girl to\nshow much emotion. There was something gracious and rather noble about\nher face. Tranquil. Her lips quivered a bit when I told her and she\ndidn't say anything for a minute. When she spoke it was quite calmly, as\nthough--well, as though she'd just missed a bus and would have to wait\nfor another. As though it was a nuisance, you know, but nothing to make\na song and dance about. 'There's nothing for me to do now but put my\nhead in the gas-oven,' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And she did.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI know this is an odd story. I don't understand it myself and if I set\nit down in black and white it is only with a faint hope that when I have\nwritten it I may get a clearer view of it, or rather with the hope that\nsome reader, better acquainted with the complications of human nature\nthan I am, may offer me an explanation that will make it comprehensible\nto me. Of course the first thing that occurs to me is that there is\nsomething Freudian about it. Now, I have read a good deal of Freud, and\nsome books by his followers, and intending to write this story I have\nrecently flipped through again the volume published by the Modern\nLibrary which contains his basic writings. It was something of a task,\nfor he is a dull and verbose writer, and the acrimony with which he\nclaims to have originated such and such a theory shows a vanity and a\njealousy of others working in the same field which somewhat ill become\nthe man of science. I believe, however, that he was a kindly and benign\nold party. As we know, there is often a great difference between the man\nand the writer. The writer may be bitter, harsh and brutal, while the\nman may be so meek and mild that he wouldn't say boo to a goose. But\nthat is neither here nor there. I found nothing in my re-reading of\nFreud's works that cast any light on the subject I had in mind. I can\nonly relate the facts and leave it at that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFirst of all I must make it plain that it is not my story and that I\nknew none of the persons with whom it is concerned. It was told me one\nevening by my friend Ned Preston, and he told it me because he didn't\nknow how to deal with the circumstances and he thought, quite wrongly as\nit happened, that I might be able to give him some advice that would\nhelp him. In a previous story I have related what I thought the reader\nshould know about Ned Preston, and so now I need only remind him that my\nfriend was a prison visitor at Wormwood Scrubs. He took his duties very\nseriously and made the prisoners' troubles his own. We had been dining\ntogether at the Café Royal in that long, low room with its absurd and\ncharming decoration which is all that remains of the old Café Royal that\npainters have loved to paint; and we were sitting over our coffee and\nliqueurs and, so far as Ned was concerned against his doctor's orders,\nsmoking very long and very good Havanas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've got a funny chap to deal with at the Scrubs just now,\" he said,\nafter a pause, \"and I'm blowed if I know how to deal with him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's he in for?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He left his wife and the court ordered him to pay so much a week in\nalimony and he's absolutely refused to pay it. I've argued with him till\nI was blue in the face. I've told him he's only cutting off his nose to\nspite his face. He says he'll stay in jail all his life rather than pay\nher a penny. I tell him he can't let her starve, and all he says is:\n'Why not?' He's perfectly well-behaved, he's no trouble, he works well,\nhe seems quite happy, he's just getting a lot of fun out of thinking\nwhat a devil of a time his wife is having.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's he got against her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She smashed his kite.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She did what?\" I cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Exactly that. She smashed his kite. He says he'll never forgive her for\nthat till his dying day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He must be crazy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, he isn't, he's a perfectly reasonable, quite intelligent, decent\nfellow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHerbert Sunbury was his name, and his mother, who was very refined,\nnever allowed him to be called Herb or Bertie, but always Herbert, just\nas she never called her husband Sam but only Samuel. Mrs. Sunbury's\nfirst name was Beatrice, and when she got engaged to Mr. Sunbury and he\nventured to call her Bea she put her foot down firmly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Beatrice I was christened,\" she said, \"and Beatrice I always have been\nand always shall be, to you and to my nearest and dearest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was a little woman, but strong, active and wiry, with a sallow skin,\nsharp, regular features and small, beady eyes. Her hair, suspiciously\nblack for her age, was always very neat, and she wore it in the style of\nQueen Victoria's daughters, which she had adopted as soon as she was old\nenough to put it up and had never thought fit to change. The possibility\nthat she did something to keep her hair its original colour was, if such\nwas the case, her only concession to frivolity, for, far from using\nrouge or lipstick, she had never in her life so much as passed a\npowder-puff over her nose. She never wore anything but black dresses of\ngood material, but made (by a little woman round the corner) regardless\nof fashion after a pattern that was both serviceable and decorous. Her\nonly ornament was a thin gold chain from which hung a small gold cross.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSamuel Sunbury was a little man too. He was as thin and spare as his\nwife, but he had sandy hair, gone very thin now so that he had to wear\nit very long on one side and brush it carefully over the large bald\npatch. He had pale blue eyes and his complexion was pasty. He was a\nclerk in a lawyer's office and had worked his way up from office boy to\na respectable position. His employer called him Mr. Sunbury and\nsometimes asked him to see an unimportant client. Every morning for\ntwenty-four years Samuel Sunbury had taken the same train to the City,\nexcept of course on Sundays and during his fortnight's holiday at the\nseaside, and every evening he had taken the same train back to the\nsuburb in which he lived. He was neat in his dress; he went to work in\nquiet grey trousers, a black coat and a bowler hat, and when he came\nhome he put on his slippers and a black coat which was too old and shiny\nto wear at the office; but on Sundays when he went to the chapel he and\nMrs. Sunbury attended he wore a morning coat with his bowler. Thus he\nshowed his respect for the day of rest and at the same time registered a\nprotest against the ungodly who went bicycling or lounged about the\nstreets until the pubs opened. On principle the Sunburys were total\nabstainers, but on Sundays, when to make up for the frugal lunch,\nconsisting of a scone and butter with a glass of milk, which Samuel had\nduring the week, Beatrice gave him a good dinner of roast beef and\nYorkshire pudding, for his health's sake she liked him to have a glass\nof beer. Since she wouldn't for the world have kept liquor in the house,\nhe sneaked out with a jug after morning service and got a quart from the\npub round the corner; but nothing would induce him to drink alone, so,\njust to be sociable-like, she had a glass too.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHerbert was the only child the Lord had vouchsafed to them, and this\ncertainly through no precaution on their part. It just happened that\nway. They doted on him. He was a pretty baby and then a good-looking\nchild. Mrs. Sunbury brought him up carefully. She taught him to sit up\nat table and not put his elbows on it, and she taught him how to use his\nknife and fork like a little gentleman. She taught him to stretch out\nhis little finger when he took his tea-cup to drink out of it and when\nhe asked why, she said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never you mind. That's how it's done. It shows you know what's what.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn due course Herbert grew old enough to go to school. Mrs. Sunbury was\nanxious because she had never let him play with the children in the\nstreet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Evil communications corrupt good manners,\" she said. \"I always have\nkept myself to myself and I always shall keep myself to myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlthough they had lived in the same house ever since they were married\nshe had taken care to keep her neighbours at a distance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You never know who people are in London,\" she said. \"One thing leads to\nanother, and before you know where you are you're mixed up with a lot of\nriff-raff and you can't get rid of them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe didn't like the idea of Herbert being thrown into contact with a lot\nof rough boys at the County Council school and she said to him:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now, Herbert, do what I do; keep yourself to yourself and don't have\nanything more to do with them than you can help.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Herbert got on very well at school. He was a good worker and far\nfrom stupid. His reports were excellent. It turned out that he had a\ngood head for figures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If that's a fact,\" said Samuel Sunbury, \"he'd better be an accountant.\nThere's always a good job waiting for a good accountant.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo it was settled there and then that this was what Herbert was to be.\nHe grew tall.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, Herbert,\" said his mother, \"soon you'll be as tall as your dad.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBy the time he left school he was two inches taller, and by the time he\nstopped growing he was five feet ten.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Just the right height,\" said his mother. \"Not too tall and not too\nshort.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was a nice-looking boy, with his mother's regular features and dark\nhair, but he had inherited his father's blue eyes, and though he was\nrather pale his skin was smooth and clear. Samuel Sunbury had got him\ninto the office of the accountants who came twice a year to do the\naccounts of his own firm and by the time he was twenty-one he was able\nto bring back to his mother every week quite a nice little sun. She gave\nhim back three half-crowns for his lunches and ten shillings for\npocket-money, and the rest she put in the Savings Bank for him against a\nrainy day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Sunbury went to bed on the night of Herbert's\ntwenty-first birthday, and in passing I may say that Mrs. Sunbury never\nwent to bed, she retired, but Mr. Sunbury, who was not quite so refined\nas his wife, always said: \"Me for Bedford,\"--when then Mr. and Mrs.\nSunbury went to bed, Mrs. Sunbury said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Some people don't know how lucky they are; thank the Lord, I do. No\none's ever had a better son than our Herbert. Hardly a day's illness in\nhis life and he's never given me a moment's worry. It just shows if you\nbring up somebody right they'll be a credit to you. Fancy him being\ntwenty-one, I can hardly believe it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I suppose before we know where we are he'll be marrying and\nleaving us.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What should he want to do that for?\" asked Mrs. Sunbury with asperity.\n\"He's got a good home here, hasn't he? Don't you go putting silly ideas\ninto his head, Samuel, or you and me'll have words and you know that's\nthe last thing I want. Marry indeed! He's got more sense than that. He\nknows when he's well off. He's got sense, Herbert has.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Sunbury was silent. He had long ago learnt that it didn't get him\nanywhere with Beatrice to answer back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't hold with a man marrying till he knows his own mind,\" she went\non. \"And a man doesn't know his own mind till he's thirty or\nthirty-five.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was pleased with his presents,\" said Mr. Sunbury to change the\nconversation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And so he ought to be,\" said Mrs. Sunbury still upset.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey had in fact been handsome. Mr. Sunbury had given him a silver\nwrist-watch, with hands that you could see in the dark, and Mrs. Sunbury\nhad given him a kite. It wasn't by any means the first one she had given\nhim. That was when he was seven years old, and it happened this way.\nThere was a large common near where they lived and on Saturday\nafternoons when it was fine Mrs. Sunbury took her husband and son for a\nwalk there. She said it was good for Samuel to get a breath of fresh air\nafter being cooped up in a stuffy office all the week. There were always\na lot of people on the common, but Mrs. Sunbury who liked to keep\nherself to herself kept out of their way as much as possible.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look at them kites, Mum,\" said Herbert suddenly one day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a fresh breeze blowing and a number of kites, small and large,\nwere sailing through the air.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Those</i>, Herbert, not them,\" said Mrs. Sunbury.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would you like to go and see where they start, Herbert?\" asked his\nfather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, yes, Dad.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a slight elevation in the middle of the common and as they\napproached it they saw boys and girls and some men racing down it to\ngive their kites a start and catch the wind. Sometimes they didn't and\nfell to the ground, but when they did they would rise, and as the owner\nunravelled his string go higher and higher. Herbert looked with\nravishment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mum, can I have a kite?\" he cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had already learnt that when he wanted anything it was better to ask\nhis mother first.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Whatever for?\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To fly it, Mum.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you're so sharp you'll cut yourself,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. and Mrs. Sunbury exchanged a smile over the little boy's head. Fancy\nhim wanting a kite. Growing quite a little man he was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you're a good boy and wash your teeth regular every morning without\nme telling you I shouldn't be surprised if Santa Claus didn't bring you\na kite on Christmas Day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nChristmas wasn't far off and Santa Claus brought Herbert his first kite.\nAt the beginning he wasn't very clever at managing it, and Mr. Sunbury\nhad to run down the hill himself and start it for him. It was a very\nsmall kite, but when Herbert saw it swim through the air and felt the\nlittle tug it gave his hand he was thrilled; and then every Saturday\nafternoon, when his father got back from the City, he would pester his\nparents to hurry over to the common. He quickly learnt how to fly it,\nand Mr. and Mrs. Sunbury, their hearts swelling with pride, would watch\nhim from the top of the knoll while he ran down and as the kite caught\nthe breeze lengthened the cord in his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt became a passion with Herbert, and as he grew older and bigger his\nmother bought him larger and larger kites. He grew very clever at\ngauging the winds and could do things with his kite you wouldn't have\nthought possible. There were other kite-flyers on the common, not only\nchildren, but men, and since nothing brings people together so naturally\nas a hobby they share it was not long before Mrs. Sunbury,\nnotwithstanding her exclusiveness, found that she, her Samuel and her\nson were on speaking terms with all and sundry. They would compare their\nrespective kites and boast of their accomplishments. Sometimes Herbert,\na big boy of sixteen now, would challenge another kite-flyer. Then he\nwould manoeuvre his kite to windward of the other fellow's, allow his\ncord to drift against his, and by a sudden jerk bring the enemy kite\ndown. But long before this Mr. Sunbury had succumbed to his son's\nenthusiasm and he would often ask to have a go himself. It must have\nbeen a funny sight to see him running down the hill in his striped\ntrousers, black coat and bowler hat. Mrs. Sunbury would trot sedately\nbehind him and when the kite was sailing free would take the cord from\nhim and watch it as it soared. Saturday afternoon became the great day\nof the week for them, and when Mr. Sunbury and Herbert left the house in\nthe morning to catch their train to the City the first thing they did\nwas to look up at the sky to see if it was flying weather. They liked\nbest of all a gusty day, with uncertain winds, for that gave them the\nbest chance to exercise their skill. All through the week, in the\nevenings, they talked about it. They were contemptuous of smaller kites\nthan theirs and envious of bigger ones. They discussed the performances\nof other flyers as hotly, and as scornfully, as boxers or\nfootball-players discuss their rivals. Their ambition was to have a\nbigger kite than anyone else and a kite that would go higher. They had\nlong given up a cord, for the kite they gave Herbert on his twenty-first\nbirthday was seven feet high, and they used piano wire wound round a\ndrum. But that did not satisfy Herbert. Somehow or other he had heard of\na box-kite which had been invented by somebody, and the idea appealed to\nhim at once. He thought he could devise something of the sort himself\nand since he could draw a little he set about making designs of it. He\ngot a small model made and tried it out one afternoon, but it wasn't a\nsuccess. He was a stubborn boy and he wasn't going to be beaten.\nSomething was wrong, and it was up to him to put it right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen an unfortunate thing happened. Herbert began to go out after\nsupper. Mrs. Sunbury didn't like it much, but Mr. Sunbury reasoned with\nher. After all, the boy was twenty-two, and it must be dull for him to\nstay home all the time. If he wanted to go for a walk or see a movie\nthere was no great harm. Herbert had fallen in love. One Saturday\nevening, after they'd had a wonderful time on the common, while they\nwere at supper, out of a clear sky he said suddenly:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mum, I've asked a young lady to come in to tea to-morrow. Is that all\nright?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You done what?\" said Mrs. Sunbury, for a moment forgetting her grammar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You heard, Mum.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And may I ask who she is and how you got to know her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Her name's Bevan, Betty Bevan, and I met her first at the pictures one\nSaturday afternoon when it was raining. It was an accident-like. She was\nsitting next me and she dropped her bag and I picked it up and she said\nthank you and so naturally we got talking.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And d'you mean to tell me you fell for an old trick like that? Dropped\nher bag indeed!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're making a mistake, Mum, she's a nice girl, she is really and well\neducated too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And when did all this happen?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"About three months ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, you met her three months ago and you've asked her to come to tea\nto-morrow?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I've seen her since of course. That first day, after the show, I\nasked her if she'd come to the pictures with me on the Tuesday evening,\nand she said she didn't know, perhaps she would and perhaps she\nwouldn't. But she came all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She would. I could have told you that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And we've been going to the pictures about twice a week ever since.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So that's why you've taken to going out so often?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's right. But, look, I don't want to force her on you, if you don't\nwant her to come to tea I'll say you've got a headache and take her\nout.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your mum will have her to tea all right,\" said Mr. Sunbury. \"Won't you,\ndear? It's only that your mum can't abide strangers. She never has liked\nthem.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I keep myself to myself,\" said Mrs. Sunbury gloomily. \"What does she\ndo?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She works in a typewriting office in the City and she lives at home, if\nyou call it home; you see, her mum died and her dad married again, and\nthey've got three kids and she doesn't get on with her step-ma. Nag,\nnag, nag all the time, she says.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Sunbury arranged the tea very stylishly. She took the knick-knacks\noff a little table in the sitting-room, which they never used, and put a\ntea-cloth on it. She got out the tea-service and the plated tea-kettle\nwhich they never used either, and she made scones, baked a cake, and cut\nthin bread-and-butter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want her to see that we're not just nobody,\" she told her Samuel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHerbert went to fetch Miss Bevan, and Mr. Sunbury intercepted them at\nthe door in case Herbert should take her into the dining-room where\nnormally they ate and sat. Herbert gave the tea-table a glance of\nsurprise as he ushered the young woman into the sitting-room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is Betty, Mum,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Miss Bevan, I presume,\" said Mrs. Sunbury.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's right, but call me Betty, won't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps the acquaintance is a bit short for that,\" said Mrs. Sunbury\nwith a gracious smile. \"Won't you sit down, Miss Bevan?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nStrangely enough, or perhaps not strangely at all, Betty Bevan looked\nvery much as Mrs. Sunbury must have looked at her age. She had the same\nsharp features and the same rather small beady eyes, but her lips were\nscarlet with paint, her cheeks lightly rouged and her short black hair\npermanently waved. Mrs. Sunbury took in all this at a glance, and she\nreckoned to a penny how much her smart rayon dress had cost, her\nextravagantly high-heeled shoes and the saucy hat on her head. Her frock\nwas very short and she showed a good deal of flesh-coloured stocking.\nMrs. Sunbury, disapproving of her make-up and of her apparel, took an\ninstant dislike to her, but she had made up her mind to behave like a\nlady, and if she didn't know how to behave like a lady nobody did, so\nthat at first things went well. She poured out tea and asked Herbert to\ngive a cup to his lady friend.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ask Miss Bevan if she'll have some bread-and-butter or a scone, Samuel,\nmy dear.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have both,\" said Samuel, handing round the two plates, in his coarse\nway. \"I like to see people eat hearty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBetty insecurely perched a piece of bread-and-butter and a scone on her\nsaucer and Mrs. Sunbury talked affably about the weather. She had the\nsatisfaction of seeing that Betty was getting more and more ill-at-ease.\nThen she cut the cake and pressed a large piece on her guest. Betty took\na bite at it and when she put it in her saucer it fell to the ground.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I am sorry,\" said the girl, as she picked it up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It doesn't matter at all, I'll cut you another piece,\" said Mrs.\nSunbury.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, don't bother, I'm not particular. The floor's clean.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope so,\" said Mrs. Sunbury with an acid smile, \"but I wouldn't dream\nof letting you eat a piece of cake that's been on the floor. Bring it\nhere, Herbert, and I'll give Miss Bevan some more.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't want any more, Mrs. Sunbury, I don't really.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry you don't like my cake. I made it specially for you.\" She\ntook a bit. \"It tastes all right to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not that, Mrs. Sunbury, it's a beautiful cake, it's only that I'm\nnot hungry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe refused to have more tea and Mrs. Sunbury saw she was glad to get\nrid of the cup. \"I expect they have their meals in the kitchen,\" she\nsaid to herself. Then Herbert lit a cigarette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give us a fag, Herb,\" said Betty. \"I'm simply dying for a smoke.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Sunbury didn't approve of women smoking, but she only raised her\neyebrows slightly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We prefer to call him Herbert, Miss Bevan,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBetty wasn't such a fool as not to see that Mrs. Sunbury had been doing\nall she could to make her uncomfortable, and now she saw a chance to get\nback on her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know,\" she said. \"When he told me his name was Herbert I nearly burst\nout laughing. Fancy calling anyone Herbert. A scream, I call it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry you don't like the name my son was given at his baptism. I\nthink it's a very nice name. But I suppose it all depends on what sort\nof class of people one is.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHerbert stepped in to the rescue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At the office they call me Bertie, Mum.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then all I can say is, they're a lot of very common men.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Sunbury lapsed into a dignified silence and the conversation, such\nas it was, was maintained by Mr. Sunbury and Herbert. It was not without\nsatisfaction that Mrs. Sunbury perceived that Betty was offended. She\nalso perceived that the girl wanted to go, but didn't quite know how to\nmanage it. She was determined not to help her. Finally Herbert took the\nmatter into his own hands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Betty, I think it's about time we were getting along,\" he said.\n\"I'll walk back with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Must you go already?\" said Mrs. Sunbury, rising to her feet. \"It's been\na pleasure, I'm sure.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pretty little thing,\" said Mr. Sunbury tentatively after the young\nthings had left.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pretty my foot. All that paint and powder. You take my word for it,\nshe'd look very different with her face washed and without a perm.\nCommon, that's what she is, common as dirt.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAn hour later Herbert came back. He was angry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look here, Mum, what d'you mean by treating the poor girl like that? I\nwas simply ashamed of you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't talk to your mother like that, Herbert,\" she flared up. \"You\ndidn't ought to have brought a woman like that into my house. Common,\nshe is, common as dirt.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Mrs. Sunbury got angry not only did her grammar grow shaky, but she\nwasn't quite safe on her aitches. Herbert took no notice of what she\nsaid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She said she'd never been so insulted in her life. I had a rare job\npacifying her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, she's never coming here again, I tell you that straight.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's what you think. I'm engaged to her, so put that in your pipe and\nsmoke it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Sunbury gasped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I am. I've been thinking about it for a long time, and then she\nwas so upset to-night I felt sorry for her, so I popped the question and\nI had a rare job persuading her, I can tell you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You fool,\" screamed Mrs. Sunbury. \"You fool.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was quite a scene then. Mrs. Sunbury and her son went at it hammer\nand tongs, and when poor Samuel tried to intervene they both told him\nroughly to shut up. At last Herbert flung out of the room and out of the\nhouse and Mrs. Sunbury burst into angry tears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNo reference was made next day to what had passed. Mrs. Sunbury was\nfrigidly polite to Herbert and he was sullen and silent. After supper he\nwent out. On Saturday he told his father and mother that he was engaged\nthat afternoon and wouldn't be able to come to the common with them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say we shall be able to do without you,\" said Mrs. Sunbury\ngrimly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was getting on to the time for their usual fortnight at the seaside.\nThey always went to Herne Bay, because Mrs. Sunbury said you had a nice\nclass of people there, and for years they had taken the same lodgings.\nOne evening, in as casual a way as he could, Herbert said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, Mum, you'd better write and tell them I shan't be wanting\nmy room this year. Betty and me are getting married and we're going to\nSouthend for the honeymoon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a moment there was dead silence in the room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bit sudden-like, isn't it, Herbert?\" said Mr. Sunbury uneasily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, they're cutting down at Betty's office and she's out of a job, so\nwe thought we'd better get married at once. We've taken two rooms in\nDabney Street and we're furnishing out of my Savings Bank money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Sunbury didn't say a word. She went deathly pale and tears rolled\ndown her thin cheeks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, come on, Mum, don't take it so hard,\" said Herbert. \"A fellow has\nto marry sometime. If Dad hadn't married you, I shouldn't be here now,\nshould I?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Sunbury brushed her tears away with an impatient hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your dad didn't marry me; I married 'im. I knew he was steady and\nrespectable. I knew he'd make a good 'usband and father. I've never 'ad\ncause to regret it and no more 'as your dad. That's right, Samuel, isn't\nit?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Right as rain, Beatrice,\" he said quickly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, you'll like Betty when you get to know her. She's a nice\ngirl, she is really. I believe you'd find you had a lot in common. You\nmust give her a chance, Mum.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's never going to set foot in this house only over my dead body.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's absurd, Mum. Why, everything'll be just the same if you'll only\nbe reasonable. I mean, we can go flying on Saturday afternoons same as\nwe always did. Just this time I've been engaged it's been difficult. You\nsee, she can't see what there is in kite-flying, but she'll come round\nto it, and after I'm married it'll be different, I mean I can come and\nfly with you and Dad; that stands to reason.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's what you think. Well, let me tell you that if you marry that\nwoman you're not going to fly my kite. I never gave it you, I bought it\nout of the housekeeping money, and it's mine, see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right then, have it your own way. Betty says it's a kid's game\nanyway and I ought to be ashamed of myself, flying a kite at my age.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got up and once more stalked angrily out of the house. A fortnight\nlater he was married. Mrs. Sunbury refused to go to the wedding and\nwouldn't let Samuel go either. They went for their holiday and came\nback. They resumed their usual round. On Saturday afternoons they went\nto the common by themselves and flew their enormous kite. Mrs. Sunbury\nnever mentioned her son. She was determined not to forgive him. But Mr.\nSunbury used to meet him on the morning train they both took and they\nchatted a little when they managed to get into the same carriage. One\nmorning Mr. Sunbury looked up at the sky.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good flying weather to-day,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you and Mum still fly?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you think? She's getting as clever as I am. You should see her\nwith her skirts pinned up running down the hill. I give you my word, I\nnever knew she had it in her. Run? Why, she can run better than what I\ncan.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't make me laugh, Dad!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder you don't buy a kite of your own, Herbert. You've been always\nso keen on it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know I was. I did suggest it once, but you know what women are, Betty\nsaid: 'Be your age,' and oh, I don't know what all. I don't want a kid's\nkite, of course, and them big kites cost money. When we started to\nfurnish Betty said it was cheaper in the long run to buy the best and so\nwe went to one of them hire purchase places and what with paying them\nevery month and the rent, well, I haven't got any more money than just\nwhat we can manage on. They say it doesn't cost any more to keep two\nthan one, well, that's not my experience so far.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Isn't she working?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, no, she says after working for donkeys' years as you might say,\nnow she's married she's going to take it easy, and of course someone's\ngot to keep the place clean and do the cooking.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo it went on for six months, and then one Saturday afternoon when the\nSunburys were as usual on the common Mrs. Sunbury said to her husband:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you see what I saw, Samuel?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I saw Herbert, if that's what you mean. I didn't mention it because I\nthought it would only upset you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't speak to him. Pretend you haven't seen him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHerbert was standing among the idle lookers-on. He made no attempt to\nspeak to his parents, but it did not escape Mrs. Sunbury that he\nfollowed with all his eyes the flight of the big kite he had flown so\noften. It began to grow chilly and the Sunburys went home. Mrs.\nSunbury's face was brisk with malice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder if he'll come next Saturday,\" said Samuel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If I didn't think betting wrong I'd bet you sixpence he will, Samuel.\nI've been waiting for this all along.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You have?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I knew from the beginning he wouldn't be able to keep away from it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was right. On the following Saturday and on every Saturday after\nthat when the weather was fine Herbert turned up on the common. No\nintercourse passed. He just stood there for a while looking on and then\nstrolled away. But after things had been going on like this for several\nweeks, the Sunburys had a surprise for him. They weren't flying the big\nkite which he was used to, but a new one, a box-kite, a small one, on\nthe model for which he had made the designs himself. He saw it was\ncreating a lot of interest among the other kite-flyers; they were\nstanding round it and Mrs. Sunbury was talking volubly. The first time\nSamuel ran down the hill with it the thing didn't rise, but flopped\nmiserably on the ground, and Herbert clenched his hands and ground his\nteeth. He couldn't bear to see it fail. Mr. Sunbury climbed up the\nlittle hill again, and the second time the box-kite took the air. There\nwas a cheer among the bystanders. After a while Mr. Sunbury pulled it\ndown and walked back with it to the hill. Mrs. Sunbury went up to her\nson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Like to have a try, Herbert?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe caught his breath.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, Mum, I should.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's just a small one because they say you have to get the knack of it.\nIt's not like the old-fashioned sort. But we've got specifications for a\nbig one, and they say when you get to know about it and the wind's right\nyou can go up to two miles with it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Sunbury joined them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Samuel, Herbert wants to try the kite.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Sunbury handed it to him, a pleased smile on his face, and Herbert\ngave his mother his hat to hold. Then he raced down the hill, the kite\ntook the air beautifully, and as he watched it rise his heart was filled\nwith exultation. It was grand to see that little black thing soaring so\nsweetly, but even as he watched it he thought of the great big one they\nwere having made. They'd never be able to manage that. Two miles in the\nair, mum had said. Whew!\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why don't you come back and have a cup of tea, Herbert,\" said Mrs.\nSunbury, \"and we'll show you the designs for the new one they want to\nbuild for us. Perhaps you could make some suggestions.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe hesitated. He'd told Betty he was just going for a walk to stretch\nhis legs, she didn't know he'd been coming to the common every week, and\nshe'd be waiting for him. But the temptation was irresistible.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't mind if I do,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter tea they looked at the specifications. The kite was huge, with\ngadgets he had never seen before, and it would cost a lot of money.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll never be able to fly it by yourselves,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We can try.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose you wouldn't like me to help you just at first?\" he asked\nuncertainly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mightn't be a bad idea,\" said Mrs. Sunbury.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was late when he got home, much later than he thought, and Betty was\nvexed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wherever have you been, Herb? I thought you were dead. Supper's waiting\nand everything.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I met some fellows and got talking.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a sharp look, but didn't answer. She sulked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter supper he suggested they should go to a movie, but she refused.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You go if you want to,\" she said. \"I don't care to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn the following Saturday he went again to the common and again his\nmother let him fly the kite. They had ordered the new one and expected\nto get it in three weeks. Presently his mother said to him:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Elizabeth is here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Betty?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Spying on you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt gave him a nasty turn, but he put on a bold front.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let her spy. I don't care.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he was nervous and wouldn't go back to tea with his parents. He went\nstraight home. Betty was waiting for him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So that's the fellows you got talking to. I've been suspicious for some\ntime, you going for a walk on Saturday afternoons, and all of a sudden I\ntumbled to it. Flying a kite, you, a grown man. Contemptible I call it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't care what you call it. I like it, and if you don't like it you\ncan lump it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I won't have it and I tell you that straight. I'm not going to have you\nmake a fool of yourself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've flown a kite every Saturday afternoon ever since I was a kid, and\nI'm going to fly a kite as long as ever I want to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's that old bitch, she's just trying to get you away from me. I know\nher. If you were a man you'd never speak to her again, not after the way\nshe's treated me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I won't have you call her that. She's my mother and I've got the right\nto see her as often as ever I want to.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe quarrel went on hour after hour. Betty screamed at him and Herbert\nshouted at her. They had had trifling disagreements before, because they\nwere both obstinate, but this was the first serious row they had had.\nThey didn't speak to one another on the Sunday, and during the rest of\nthe week, though outwardly there was peace between them, their\nill-feeling rankled. It happened that the next two Saturdays it poured\nwith rain. Betty smiled to herself when she saw the downpour, but if\nHerbert was disappointed he gave no sign of it. The recollection of\ntheir quarrel grew dim. Living in two rooms as they did, sleeping in the\nsame bed, it was inevitable that they should agree to forget their\ndifferences. Betty went out of her way to be nice to her Herb, and she\nthought that now she had given him a taste of her tongue and he knew she\nwasn't going to be put upon by anyone, he'd be reasonable. He was a good\nhusband in his way, generous with his money and steady. Give her time\nand she'd manage him all right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut after a fortnight of bad weather it cleared.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Looks as if were going to have good flying weather to-morrow,\" said Mr.\nSunbury as they met on the platform to await their morning train. \"The\nnew kite's come.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It has?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your mum says of course we'd like you to come and help us with it, but\nno one's got the right to come between a man and his wife, and if you're\nafraid of Betty, her kicking up a rumpus, I mean, you'd better not come.\nThere's a young fellow we've got to know on the common who's just mad\nabout it, and he says he'll get it to fly if anybody can.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHerbert was seized with a pang of jealousy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you let any strangers touch our kite. I'll be there all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you think it over, Herbert, and if you don't come we shall quite\nunderstand.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll come,\" said Herbert.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo next day when he got back from the City he changed from his business\nclothes into slacks and an old coat. Betty came into the bedroom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you doing?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Changing,\" he answered gaily. He was so excited, he couldn't keep the\nsecret to himself. \"Their new kite's come and I'm going to fly it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh no, you're not,\" she said. \"I won't have it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be a fool, Betty. I'm going, I tell you, and if you don't like it\nyou can do the other thing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not going to let you, so that's that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe shut the door and stood in front of it. Her eyes flashed and her jaw\nwas set. She was a little thing and he was a tall strong man. He took\nhold of her two arms to push her out of the way, but she kicked him\nviolently on the shin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you want me to give you a sock on the jaw?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you go you don't come back,\" she shouted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe caught her up, though she struggled and kicked, threw her on to the\nbed and went out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIf the small box-kite had caused an excitement on the common it was\nnothing to what the new one caused. But it was difficult to manage, and\nthough they ran and panted and other enthusiastic flyers helped them\nHerbert couldn't get it up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never mind,\" he said, \"we'll get the knack of it presently. The wind's\nnot right to-day, that's all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went back to tea with his father and mother and they talked it over\njust as they had talked in the old days. He delayed going because he\ndidn't fancy the scene Betty would make him, but when Mrs. Sunbury went\ninto the kitchen to get supper ready he had to go home. Betty was\nreading the paper. She looked up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your bag's packed,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My what?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You heard what I said. I said if you went you needn't come back. I\nforgot about your things. Everything's packed. It's in the bedroom.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked at her for a moment with surprise. She pretended to be reading\nagain. He would have liked to give her a good hiding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right, have it your own way,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went into the bedroom. His clothes were packed in a suit-case, and\nthere was a brown-paper parcel in which Betty had put whatever was left\nover. He took the bag in one hand, the parcel in the other, walked\nthrough the sitting-room without a word and out of the house. He walked\nto his mother's and rang the bell. She opened the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've come home, Mum,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you, Herbert? Your room's ready for you. Put your things down and\ncome in. We were just sitting down to supper.\" They went into the\ndining-room. \"Samuel, Herbert's come home. Run out and get a quart of\nbeer.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOver supper and during the rest of the evening he told them the trouble\nhe had had with Betty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you're well out of it, Herbert,\" said Mrs. Sunbury when he had\nfinished. \"I told you she was no wife for you. Common she is, common as\ndirt, and you who's always been brought up so nice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe found it good to sleep in his own bed, the bed he'd been used to all\nhis life, and to come down to breakfast on the Sunday morning, unshaved\nand unwashed, and read the <i>News of the World</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We won't go to chapel this morning,\" said Mrs. Sunbury. \"It's been an\nupset to you, Herbert; we'll all take it easy to-day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDuring the week they talked a lot about the kite, but they also talked a\nlot about Betty. They discussed what she would do next.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She'll try and get you back,\" said Mrs. Sunbury.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A fat chance she's got of doing that,\" said Herbert.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll have to provide for her,\" said his father.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why should he do that?\" cried Mrs. Sunbury. \"She trapped him into\nmarrying her and now she's turned him out of the home he made for her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll give her what's right as long as she leaves me alone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was feeling more comfortable every day, in fact he was beginning to\nfeel as if he'd never been away, he settled in like a dog in its own\nparticular basket; it was nice having his mother to brush his clothes\nand mend his socks; she gave him the sort of things he'd always eaten\nand liked best; Betty was a scrappy sort of cook, it had been fun just\nat first, like picnicking, but it wasn't the sort of eating a man could\nget his teeth into, and he could never get over his mother's idea that\nfresh food was better than the stuff you bought in tins. He got sick of\nthe sight of tinned salmon. Then it was nice to have space to move about\nin rather than be cooped up in two small rooms, one of which had to\nserve as a kitchen as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never made a bigger mistake in my life than when I left home, Mum,\"\nhe said to her once.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know that, Herbert, but you're back now and you've got no cause ever\nto leave it again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis salary was paid on Friday and in the evening when they had just\nfinished supper the bell rang.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's her,\" they said with one voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHerbert went pale. His mother gave him a glance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You leave it to me,\" she said. \"I'll see her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe opened the door. Betty was standing on the threshold. She tried to\npush her way in, but Mrs. Sunbury prevented her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want to see Herb.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't. He's out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, he isn't. I watched him go in with his dad and he hasn't come out\nagain.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, he doesn't want to see you, and if you start making a disturbance\nI'll call the police.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want my week's money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's all you've ever wanted of him.\" She took out her purse. \"There's\nthirty-five shillings for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thirty-five shillings? The rent's twelve shillings a week.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's all you're going to get. He's got to pay his board here, hasn't\nhe?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And then there's the instalments on the furniture.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'll see about that when the time comes. D'you want the money or don't\nyou?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nConfused, unhappy, browbeaten, Betty stood irresolutely. Mrs. Sunbury\nthrust the money in her hand and slammed the door in her face. She went\nback to the dining-room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've settled her hash all right,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe bell rang again, it rang repeatedly, but they did not answer it, and\npresently it stopped. They guessed that Betty had gone way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was fine next day, with just the right velocity in the wind, and\nHerbert, after failing two or three times, found he had got the knack of\nflying the big box-kite. It soared into the air and up and up as he\nunreeled the wire.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, it's a mile up if it's a yard,\" he told his mother excitedly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had never had such a thrill in his life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSeveral weeks passed by. They concocted a letter for Herbert to write in\nwhich he told Betty that so long as she didn't molest him or members of\nhis family she would receive a postal order for thirty-five shillings\nevery Saturday morning and he would pay the instalments on the furniture\nas they came due. Mrs. Sunbury had been much against this, but Mr.\nSunbury, for once at variance with her, and Herbert agreed that it was\nthe right thing to do. Herbert by then had learnt the ways of the new\nkite and was able to do great things with it. He no longer bothered to\nhave contests with the other kite-flyers. He was out of their class.\nSaturday afternoons were his moments of glory. He revelled in the\nadmiration he aroused in the bystanders and enjoyed the envy he knew he\nexcited in the less fortunate flyers. Then one evening when he was\nwalking back from the station with his father Betty waylaid him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa, Herb,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want to talk to my husband alone, Mr. Sunbury.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's nothing you've got to say to me that my dad can't hear,\" said\nHerbert sullenly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe hesitated. Mr. Sunbury fidgeted. He didn't know whether to stay or\ngo.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right, then,\" she said. \"I want you to come back home, Herb. I\ndidn't mean it that night when I packed your bag. I only did it to\nfrighten you. I was in a temper. I'm sorry for what I did. It's all so\nsilly, quarrelling about a kite.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'm not coming back, see. When you turned me out you did me the\nbest turn you ever did me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTears began to trickle down Betty's cheeks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I love you, Herb. If you want to fly your silly old kite, you fly\nit, I don't care so long as you come back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you very much, but it's not good enough. I know when I'm well off\nand I've had enough of married life to last me a lifetime. Come on,\nDad.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey walked on quickly and Betty made no attempt to follow them. On the\nfollowing Sunday they went to chapel and after dinner Herbert went to\nthe coal-shed where they kept the kite to have a look at it. He just\ncouldn't keep away from it. He doted on it. In a minute he rushed back,\nhis face white, with a hatchet in his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's smashed it up. She did it with this.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Sunburys gave a cry of consternation and hurried to the coal-shed.\nWhat Herbert had said was true. The kite, the new, expensive kite, was\nin fragments. It had been savagely attacked with the hatchet, the\nwoodwork was all in pieces, the reel was hacked to bits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She must have done it while we were at chapel. Watched us go out,\nthat's what she did.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But how did she get in?\" asked Mr. Sunbury.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I had two keys. When I came home I noticed one was missing, but I\ndidn't think anything about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can't be sure she did it, some of them fellows on the common have\nbeen very snooty, I wouldn't put it past them to have done this.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, we'll soon find out,\" said Herbert. \"I'll go and ask her, and if\nshe did it I'll kill her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis rage was so terrible that Mrs. Sunbury was frightened.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And get yourself hung for murder? No, Herbert, I won't let you go. Let\nyour dad go, and when he comes back we'll decide what to do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's right, Herbert, let me go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey had a job to persuade him, but in the end Mr. Sunbury went. In half\nan hour he came back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She did it all right. She told me straight out. She's proud of it. I\nwon't repeat her language, it fair startled me, but the long and short\nof it was she was jealous of the kite. She said Herbert loved the kite\nmore than he loved her and so she smashed it up and if she had to do it\nagain she'd do it again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Lucky she didn't tell me that. I'd have wrung her neck even if I'd had\nto swing for it. Well, she never gets another penny out of me, that's\nall.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She'll sue you,\" said his father.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The instalment on the furniture is due next week, Herbert,\" said Mrs.\nSunbury quietly. \"In your place I wouldn't pay it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then they'll just take it away,\" said Samuel, \"and all the money he's\npaid on it so far will be wasted.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, what of it?\" she answered. \"He can afford it. He's rid of her for\ngood and all and we've got him back and that's the chief thing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't care twopence about the money,\" said Herbert. \"I can see her\nface when they come and take the furniture away. It meant a lot to her,\nit did, and the piano, she set a rare store on that piano.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo on the following Friday he did not send Betty her weekly money, and\nwhen she sent him on a letter from the furniture people to say that if\nhe didn't pay the instalment due by such and such a date they would\nremove it, he wrote back and said he wasn't in a position to continue\nthe payments and they could remove the furniture at their convenience.\nBetty took to waiting for him at the station, and when he wouldn't speak\nto her followed him down the street screaming curses at him. In the\nevenings she would come to the house and ring the bell till they thought\nthey would go mad, and Mr. and Mrs. Sunbury had the greatest difficulty\nin preventing Herbert from going out and giving her a sound thrashing.\nOnce she threw a stone and broke the sitting-room window. She wrote\nobscene and abusive postcards to him at his office. At last she went to\nthe magistrate's court and complained that her husband had left her and\nwasn't providing for her support. Herbert received a summons. They both\ntold their story and if the magistrate thought it a strange one he\ndidn't say so. He tried to effect a reconciliation between them, but\nHerbert resolutely refused to go back to his wife. The magistrate\nordered him to pay Betty twenty-five shillings a week. He said he\nwouldn't pay it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then you'll go to prison,\" said the magistrate. \"Next case.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Herbert meant what he said. On Betty's complaint he was brought once\nmore before the magistrate, who asked him what reason he had for not\nobeying the order.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I said I wouldn't pay her and I won't, not after she smashed my kite.\nAnd if you send me to prison I'll go to prison.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe magistrate was stern with him this time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're a very foolish young man,\" he said. \"I'll give you a week to pay\nthe arrears, and if I have any more nonsense from you you'll go to\nprison till you come to your senses.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHerbert didn't pay, and that is how my friend Ned Preston came to know\nhim and I heard the story.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What d'you make of it?\" asked Ned as he finished. \"You know, Betty\nisn't a bad girl. I've seen her several times, there's nothing wrong\nwith her except her insane jealousy of Herbert's kite; and he isn't a\nfool by any means. In fact he's smarter than the average. What d'you\nsuppose there is in kite-flying that makes the damned fool so mad about\nit?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know,\" I answered. I took my time to think. \"You see, I don't\nknow a thing about flying a kite. Perhaps it gives him a sense of power\nas he watches it soaring towards the clouds and of mastery over the\nelements as he seems to bend the winds of heaven to his will. It may be\nthat in some queer way he identifies himself with the kite flying so\nfree and so high above him, and it's as it were an escape from the\nmonotony of life. It may be that in some dim, confused way it represents\nan ideal of freedom and adventure. And you know, when a man once gets\nbitten with the virus of the ideal not all the King's doctors and not\nall the King's surgeons can rid him of it. But all this is very fanciful\nand I dare say it's just stuff and nonsense. I think you'd better put\nyour problem before someone who knows a lot more about the psychology of\nthe human animal than I do.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nMy friend Wyman Holt is a professor of English Literature in one of the\nsmaller universities of the Middle West, and hearing that I was speaking\nin a near-by city--near-by as distances go in the vastness of\nAmerica--he wrote to ask me if I would come and give a talk to his\nclass. He suggested that I should stay with him for a few days so that\nhe could show me something of the surrounding country. I accepted the\ninvitation, but told him that my engagements would prevent me from\nspending more than a couple of nights with him. He met me at the\nstation, drove me to his house and after we had had a drink we walked\nover to the campus. I was somewhat taken aback to find so many people in\nthe hall in which I was to speak, for I had not expected more than\ntwenty at the outside and I was not prepared to give a solemn lecture,\nbut only an informal chat. I was more than a little intimidated to see a\nnumber of middle-aged and elderly persons, some of whom I suspected were\nmembers of the faculty, and I was afraid they would find what I had to\nsay very superficial. However, there was nothing to do but to start and,\nafter Wyman had introduced me to the audience in a manner that I very\nwell knew I couldn't live up to, that is what I did. I said my say, I\nanswered as best I could a number of questions, and then I retired with\nWyman into a little room at the back of the stage from which I had\nspoken.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSeveral people came in. They said the usual kindly things to me that are\nsaid on these occasions, and I made the usual polite replies. I was\nthirsting for a drink. Then a woman came in and held out her hand to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How very nice it is to see you again,\" she said. \"It's years since we\nlast met.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo the best of my belief I'd never set eyes on her before. I forced a\ncordial smile to my tired, stiff lips, shook her proffered hand\neffusively and wondered who the devil she was. My professor must have\nseen from my face that I was trying to place her, for he said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Greene is married to a member of our faculty and she gives a\ncourse on the Renaissance and Italian literature.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Really,\" I said. \"Interesting.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was no wiser than before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Has Wyman told you that you're dining with us to-morrow night?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm very glad,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not a party. Only my husband, his brother and my sister-in-law. I\nsuppose Florence has changed a lot since then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Florence?\" I said to myself. \"Florence?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat was evidently where I'd known her. She was a woman of about fifty\nwith grey hair simply done and marcelled without exaggeration. She was a\ntrifle too stout and she was dressed neatly enough, but without\ndistinction, in a dress that I guessed had been bought ready-made at the\nlocal branch of a big store. She had rather large eyes of a pale blue\nand a poor complexion; she wore no rouge and had used a lipstick but\nsparingly. She seemed a nice creature. There was something maternal in\nher demeanour, something placid and fulfilled, which I found appealing.\nI supposed that I had run across her on one of my frequent visits to\nFlorence and because it was perhaps the only time she had been there our\nmeeting made more of an impression on her than on me. I must confess\nthat my acquaintance with the wives of members of a faculty is very\nlimited, but she was just the sort of person I should have expected the\nwife of a professor to be, and picturing her life, useful but\nuneventful, on scanty means, with its little social gatherings, its\nbickerings, its gossip, its busy dullness, I could easily imagine that\nher trip to Florence must linger with her as a thrilling and\nunforgettable experience.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn the way back to his house Wyman said to me:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll like Jasper Greene. He's clever.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's he a professor of?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's not a professor; he's an instructor. A fine scholar. He's her\nsecond husband. She was married to an Italian before.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh?\" That didn't chime in with my ideas at all. \"What was her name?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't a notion. I don't believe it was a great success.\" Wyman\nchuckled. \"That's only a deduction I draw from the fact that she hasn't\na single thing in the house to suggest that she ever spent any time in\nItaly. I should have expected her to have at least a refectory table, an\nold chest or two and an embroidered cope hanging on the wall.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI laughed. I knew those rather dreary pieces that people buy when\nthey're in Italy, the gilt wooden candlesticks, the Venetian glass\nmirrors and the high-backed, comfortless chairs. They look well enough\nwhen you see them in the crowded shops of the dealers in antiques, but\nwhen you bring them to another country they're too often a sad\ndisappointment. Even if they're genuine, which they seldom are, they\nlook ill-at-ease and out of place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Laura has money,\" Wyman went on. \"When they married she furnished the\nhouse from cellar to attic in Chicago. It's quite a show place; it's a\nlittle masterpiece of hideousness and vulgarity. I never go into the\nliving-room without marvelling at the unerring taste with which she\npicked out exactly what you'd expect to find in the bridal suite of a\nsecond-class hotel in Atlantic City.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo explain this irony I should state that Wyman's living-room was all\nchromium and glass, rough modern fabrics, with a boldly Cubist rug on\nthe floor, and on the walls Picasso prints and drawings by Tchelicheff.\nHowever, he gave me a very good dinner. We spent the evening chatting\npleasantly about things that mutually interested us and finished it with\na couple of bottles of beer. I went to bed in a room of somewhat\naggressive modernity. I read for a while and then putting out the light\ncomposed myself to sleep.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Laura?\" I said to myself. \"Laura what?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI tried to think back. I thought of all the people I knew in Florence,\nhoping that by association I might recall when and where I had come in\ncontact with Mrs. Greene. Since I was going to dine with her I wanted to\nrecall something that would prove that I had not forgotten her. People\nlook upon it as a slight if you don't remember them. I suppose we all\nattach a sort of importance to ourselves, and it is humiliating to\nrealise that we have left no impression at all upon the persons we have\nassociated with. I dozed off, but before I fell into the blessedness of\ndeep sleep, my subconscious, released from the effort of striving at\nrecollection, I suppose, grew active and I was suddenly wide awake, for\nI remembered who Laura Greene was. It was no wonder that I had forgotten\nher, for it was twenty-five years since I had seen her, and then only\nhaphazardly during a month I spent in Florence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was just after the First World War. She had been engaged to a man who\nwas killed in it and she and her mother had managed to get over to\nFrance to see his grave. They were San Francisco people. After doing\ntheir sad errand they had come down to Italy and were spending the\nwinter in Florence. At that time there was quite a large colony of\nEnglish and Americans. I had some American friends, a Colonel Harding\nand his wife, colonel because he had occupied an important position in\nthe Red Cross, who had a handsome villa in the Via Bolognese, and they\nasked me to stay with them. I spent most of my mornings sightseeing and\nmet my friends at Doney's in the Via Tornabuoni round about noon to\ndrink a cocktail. Doney's was the gathering-place of everybody one knew,\nAmericans, English and such of the Italians as frequented their society.\nThere you heard all the gossip of the town. There was generally a\nlunch-party either at a restaurant or at one or other of the villas with\ntheir fine old gardens a mile or two from the centre of the city. I had\nbeen given a card to the Florence Club, and in the afternoon Charley\nHarding and I used to go there to play bridge or a dangerous game of\npoker with a pack of thirty-two cards. In the evening there would be a\ndinner-party with more bridge perhaps and often dancing. One met the\nsame people all the time, but the group was large enough, the people\nsufficiently various, to prevent it from being tedious. Everyone was\nmore or less interested in the arts, as was only right and proper in\nFlorence, so that, idle as life seemed, it was not entirely frivolous.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLaura and her mother, Mrs. Clayton, a widow, lived in one of the better\nboarding-houses. They appeared to be comfortably off. They had come to\nFlorence with letters of introduction and soon made many friends.\nLaura's story appealed to the sympathies, and people were glad on that\naccount to do what they could for the two women, but they were in\nthemselves nice and quickly became liked for themselves. They were\nhospitable and gave frequent lunches at one or other of the restaurants\nwhere one ate macaroni and the inevitable scaloppini, and drank Chianti.\nMrs. Clayton was perhaps a little lost in this cosmopolitan society,\nwhere matters that were strange to her were seriously or gaily talked\nabout, but Laura took to it as though it were her native element. She\nengaged an Italian woman to teach her the language and soon was reading\nthe <i>Inferno</i> with her; she devoured books on the art of the Renaissance\nand on Florentine history, and I sometimes came across her, Baedeker in\nhand, at the Uffizzi or in some church studiously examining works of\nart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was twenty-four or twenty-five then and I was well over forty, so\nthat though we often met we became cordially acquainted rather than\nintimate. She was by no means beautiful, but she was comely in rather an\nunusual way; she had an oval face with bright blue eyes and very dark\nhair which she wore very simply, parted in the middle, drawn over her\nears and tied in a chignon low on the nape of her neck. She had a good\nskin and a naturally high colour; her features were good without being\nremarkable and her teeth were even, small and white; but her chief asset\nwas her easy grace of movement, and I was not surprised when they told\nme that she danced \"divinely\". Her figure was very good, somewhat fuller\nthan was the fashion of the moment; and I think what made her attractive\nwas the odd mingling in her appearance of the Madonna in an altar-piece\nby one of the later Italian painters and a suggestion of sensuality. It\ncertainly made her very alluring to the Italians who gathered at Doney's\nin the morning or were occasionally invited to lunch or dinner in the\nAmerican or English villas. She was evidently accustomed to dealing with\namorous young men, for though she was charming, gracious and friendly\nwith them she kept them at their distance. She quickly discovered that\nthey were all looking for an American heiress who would restore the\nfamily fortunes, and with a demure amusement which I found admirable\nmade them delicately understand that she was far from rich. They sighed\na little and turned their attentions at Doney's, which was their happy\nhunting-ground, to more likely objects. They continued to dance with\nher, and to keep their hand in flirted with her, but their aspirations\nceased to be matrimonial.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut there was one young man who persisted. I knew him slightly because\nhe was one of the regular poker-players at the club. I played\noccasionally. It was impossible to win and the disgruntled foreigners\nused sometimes to say that the Italians ganged up on us, but it may be\nonly that they knew the particular game they played better than we did.\nLaura's admirer, Tito di San Pietro, was a bold and even reckless player\nand would often lose sums he could ill afford. (That was not his real\nname, but I call him that since his own is famous in Florentine\nhistory.) He was a good-looking youth, neither short nor tall, with fine\nblack eyes, thick black hair brushed back from his forehead and shining\nwith oil, an olive skin, and features of classical regularity. He was\npoor and he had some vague occupation, which did not seem to interfere\nwith his amusements, but he was always beautifully dressed. No one quite\nknew where he lived, in a furnished room perhaps or in the attic of some\nrelation; and all that remained of his ancestors' great possessions was\na cinquecento villa about thirty miles from the city. I never saw it,\nbut I was told that it was of amazing beauty, with a great neglected\ngarden of cypresses and live oaks, overgrown borders of box, terraces,\nartificial grottoes and crumbling statues. His widowed father, the\ncount, lived there alone and subsisted on the wine he made from the\nvines of the small property he still owned and the oil from his olive\ntrees. He seldom came to Florence, so I never met him, but Charley\nHarding knew him fairly well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's a perfect specimen of the Tuscan nobleman of the old school,\" he\nsaid. \"He was in the diplomatic service in his youth and he knows the\nworld. He has beautiful manners and such an air, you almost feel he's\ndoing you a favour when he says how d'you do to you. He's a brilliant\ntalker. Of course he hasn't a penny, he squandered the little he\ninherited on gambling and women, but he bears his poverty with great\ndignity. He acts as though money were something beneath his notice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What sort of age is he?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fifty, I should say, but he's still the handsomest man I've ever seen\nin my life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You describe him, Bessie. When he first came here he made a pass at\nBessie. I've never been quite sure how far it went.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be a fool, Charley,\" Mrs. Harding laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him the sort of look a woman gives her husband when she has\nbeen married to him many years and is quite satisfied with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's very attractive to women and he knows it,\" she said. \"When he\ntalks to you he gives you the impression that you're the only woman in\nthe world and of course it's flattering. But it's only a game and a\nwoman would have to be a perfect fool to take him seriously. He is very\nhandsome. Tall and spare and he holds himself well. He has great dark\nliquid eyes, like the boy's; his hair is snow-white, but very thick\nstill, and the contrast with his bronzed, young face is really\nbreath-taking. He has a ravaged, rather battered look, but at the same\ntime a look of such distinction, it's really quite incredibly romantic.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He also has his great dark liquid eyes on the main chance,\" said\nCharley Harding dryly. \"And he'll never let Tito marry a girl who has no\nmore money than Laura.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She has about five thousand dollars a year of her own,\" said Bessie.\n\"And she'll get that much more when her mother dies.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Her mother can live for another thirty years, and five thousand a year\nwon't go far to keep a husband, a father and two or three children, and\nrestore a ruined villa with practically not a stick of furniture in it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think the boy's desperately in love with her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How old is he?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Twenty-six.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA few days after this Charley, on coming back to lunch, since for once\nwe were lunching by ourselves, told me that he had run across Mrs.\nClayton in the Via Tornabuoni and she had said that she and Laura were\ndriving out that afternoon with Tito to meet his father and see the\nvilla.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What d'you suppose that means?\" asked Bessie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My guess is that Tito is taking Laura to be inspected by his old man,\nand if he approves he's going to ask her to marry him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And will he approve?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not on your life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Charley was wrong. After the two women had been shown over the house\nthey were taken for a walk round the garden. Without exactly knowing how\nit had happened Mrs. Clayton found herself alone in an alley with the\nold count. She spoke no Italian, but he had been an attaché in London\nand his English was tolerable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your daughter is charming, Mrs. Clayton,\" he said. \"I am not surprised\nthat my Tito has fallen in love with her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Clayton was no fool and it may be that she too had guessed why the\nyoung man had asked them to go and see the ancestral villa.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Young Italians are very impressionable. Laura is sensible enough not to\ntake their attentions too seriously.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was hoping she was not quite indifferent to the boy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have no reason to believe that she likes him any more than any other\nof the young men who dance with her,\" Mrs. Clayton answered somewhat\ncoldly. \"I think I should tell you at once that my daughter has a very\nmoderate income and she will have no more till I die.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will be frank with you. I have nothing in the world but this house\nand the few acres that surround it. My son could not afford to marry a\npenniless girl, but he is not a fortune-hunter and he loves your\ndaughter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe count had not only the grand manner, but a great deal of charm and\nMrs. Clayton was not insensible to it. She softened a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All that is neither here nor there. We don't arrange our children's\nmarriages in America. If Tito wants to marry her, let him ask her, and\nif she's prepared to marry him she'll presumably say so.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Unless I am greatly mistaken that is just what he is doing now. I hope\nwith all my heart that he will be successful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey strolled on and presently saw walking towards them the two young\npeople hand in hand. It was not difficult to guess what had passed. Tito\nkissed Mrs. Clayton's hand and his father on both cheeks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Clayton, Papa, Laura has consented to be my wife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe engagement made something of a stir in Florentine society and a\nnumber of parties were given for the young couple. It was quite evident\nthat Tito was very much in love, but less so that Laura was. He was\ngood-looking, adoring, high-spirited and gay; it was likely enough that\nshe loved him; but she was a girl who did not display emotion and she\nremained what she had always been, somewhat placid, amiable, serious but\nfriendly, and easy to talk to. I wondered to what extent she had been\ninfluenced to accept Tito's offer by his great name, with its historical\nassociations, and the sight of that beautiful house with its lovely view\nand the romantic garden.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Anyhow there's no doubt about its being a love match on his side,\" said\nBessie Harding, when we were talking it over. \"Mrs. Clayton tells me\nthat neither Tito nor his father has shown any desire to know how much\nLaura has.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd bet a million dollars that they know to the last cent what she's\ngot and they've calculated exactly how much it comes to in <i>lire</i>,\" said\nHarding with a grunt.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're a beastly old man, darling,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave another grunt.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShortly after that I left Florence. The marriage took place from the\nHardings' house and a vast crowd came to it, ate their food and drank\ntheir champagne. Tito and his wife took an apartment on the Lungarno and\nthe old count returned to his lonely villa in the hills. I did not go to\nFlorence again for three years and then only for a week. I was staying\nonce more with the Hardings. I asked about my old friends and then\nremembered Laura and her mother.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Clayton went back to San Francisco,\" said Bessie, \"and Laura and\nTito live at the villa with the count. They're very happy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Any babies?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go on,\" said Harding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBessie gave her husband a look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I cannot imagine why I've lived thirty years with a man I dislike so\nmuch,\" she said. \"They gave up the apartment on the Lungarno. Laura\nspent a good deal of money doing things to the villa, there wasn't a\nbathroom in it, she put in central heating, and she had to buy a lot of\nfurniture to make it habitable, and then Tito lost a small fortune\nplaying poker and poor Laura had to pay up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hadn't he got a job?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It didn't amount to anything and it came to an end.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What Bessie means by that is that he was fired,\" Harding put in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, to cut a long story short, they thought it would be more\neconomical to live at the villa and Laura had the idea that it would\nkeep Tito out of mischief. She loves the garden and she's made it\nlovely. Tito simply worships her and the old count's taken quite a fancy\nto her. So really it's all turned out very well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It may interest you to know that Tito was in last Thursday,\" said\nHarding. \"He played like a madman and I don't know how much he lost.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, Charley. He promised Laura he'd never play again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As if a gambler ever kept a promise like that. It'll be like last time.\nHe'll burst into tears and say he loves her and it's a debt of honour\nand unless he can get the money he'll blow his brains out. And Laura\nwill pay as she paid before.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's weak, poor dear, but that's his only fault. Unlike most Italian\nhusbands he's absolutely faithful to her and he's kindness itself.\" She\nlooked at Harding with a sort of humorous grimness. \"I've yet to find a\nhusband who was perfect.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd better start looking around pretty soon, dear, or it'll be too\nlate,\" he retorted with a grin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI left the Hardings and returned to London. Charley Harding and I\ncorresponded in a desultory sort of way, and about a year later I got a\nletter from him. He told me as usual what he had been doing in the\ninterval, and mentioned that he had been to Montecatini for the baths\nand had gone with Bessie to visit friends in Rome; he spoke of the\nvarious people I knew in Florence, So and So had just bought a Bellini\nand Mrs. Such and Such had gone to America to divorce her husband. Then\nhe went on: \"I suppose you've heard about the San Pietros. It's shaken\nus all and we can talk of nothing else. Laura's terribly upset, poor\nthing, and she's going to have a baby. The police keep on questioning\nher and that doesn't make it any easier for her. Of course we brought\nher to stay here. Tito comes up for trial in another month.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI hadn't the faintest notion what all this was about. So I wrote at once\nto Harding asking him what it meant. He answered with a long letter.\nWhat he had to tell me was terrible. I will relate the bare and brutal\nfacts as shortly as I can. I learned them partly from Harding's letter\nand partly from what he and Bessie told me when two years later I was\nwith them once more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe count and Laura took to one another at once and Tito was pleased to\nsee how quickly they had formed an affectionate friendship, for he was\nas devoted to his father as he was in love with his wife. He was glad\nthat the count began to come more often to Florence than he had been\nused to. They had a spare room in the apartment and on occasion he spent\ntwo or three nights with them. He and Laura would go bargain-hunting in\nthe antique shops and buy old pieces to put in the villa. He had tact\nand knowledge and little by little the house, with its spacious rooms\nand marble floors, lost its forlorn air and became a friendly place to\nlive in. Laura had a passion for gardening and she and the count spent\nlong hours together planning and then supervising the workmen who were\nrestoring the gardens to their ancient, rather stately, beauty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLaura made light of it when Tito's financial difficulties forced them to\ngive up the apartment in Florence; she had had enough of Florentine\nsociety by then and was not displeased to live altogether in the grand\nhouse that had belonged to his ancestors. Tito liked city life and the\nprospect dismayed him, but he could not complain since it was his own\nfolly that had made it necessary for them to cut down expenses. They\nstill had the car and he amused himself by taking long drives while his\nfather and Laura were busy, and if they knew that now and then he went\ninto Florence to have a flutter at the club they shut their eyes to it.\nSo a year passed. Then, he hardly knew why, he was seized with a vague\nmisgiving. He couldn't put his finger on anything; he had an uneasy\nfeeling that perhaps Laura didn't care for him so much as she had at\nfirst; sometimes it seemed to him that his father was inclined to be\nimpatient with him; they appeared to have a great deal to say to one\nanother, but he got the impression that he was being edged out of their\nconversation, as though he were a child who was expected to sit still\nand not interrupt while his elders talked of things over his head; he\nhad a notion that often his presence was unwelcome to them and that they\nwere more at their ease when he was not there. He knew his father, and\nhis reputation, but the suspicion that arose in him was so horrible that\nhe refused to entertain it. And yet sometimes he caught a look passing\nbetween them that disconcerted him, there was a tender possessiveness in\nhis father's eyes, a sensual complacency in Laura's, which, if he had\nseen it in others, would have convinced him that they were lovers. But\nhe couldn't, he wouldn't, believe that there was anything between them.\nThe count couldn't help making love to a woman and it was likely enough\nthat Laura felt his extraordinary fascination, but it was shameful to\nsuppose for a moment that they, these two people he loved, had formed a\ncriminal, almost an incestuous, connection. He was sure that Laura had\nno idea that there was anything more in her feeling than the natural\naffection of a young, happily-married woman for her father-in-law.\nNotwithstanding he thought it better that she should not remain in\neveryday contact with his father, and one day he suggested that they\nshould go back to live in Florence. Laura and the count were astonished\nthat he should propose such a thing and would not hear of it. Laura said\nthat, having spent so much money on the villa, she couldn't afford to\nset up another establishment, and the count that it was absurd to leave\nit, now that Laura had made it so comfortable, to live in a wretched\napartment in the city. An argument started and Tito got rather excited.\nHe took some remark of Laura's to mean that if she lived at the villa it\nwas to keep him out of temptation. This reference to his losses at the\npoker-table angered him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You always throw your money in my face,\" he said passionately. \"If I'd\nwanted to marry money I'd have had the sense to marry someone who had a\ngreat deal more than you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLaura went very pale and glanced at the count.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You have no right to speak to Laura like that,\" he said. \"You are an\nill-mannered oaf.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall speak to my wife exactly as I choose.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are mistaken. So long as you are in my house you will treat her\nwith the respect which is her right and your duty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When I want lessons in behaviour from you, Father, I will let you\nknow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are very impertinent, Tito. You will kindly leave the room.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked very stern and dignified and Tito, furious and yet slightly\nintimidated, leapt to his feet and stalked out slamming the door behind\nhim. He took the car and drove into Florence. He won quite a lot of\nmoney that day (lucky at cards, unlucky in love) and to celebrate his\nwinnings got more than a little drunk. He did not go back to the villa\ntill the following morning. Laura was as friendly and placid as ever,\nbut his father was somewhat cool. No reference was made to the scene.\nBut from then on things went from bad to worse. Tito was sullen and\nmoody, the count critical, and on occasion sharp words passed between\nthem. Laura did not interfere, but Tito gained the impression that after\na dispute that had been more than acrimonious Laura interceded with his\nfather, for the count thenceforward, refusing to be annoyed, began to\ntreat him with the tolerant patience with which you would treat a\nwayward child. He convinced himself that they were acting in concert and\nhis suspicions grew formidable. They even increased when Laura in her\ngood-natured way, saying that it must be very dull for him to remain so\nmuch in the country, encouraged him to go more often to Florence to see\nhis friends. He jumped to the conclusion that she said this only to be\nrid of him. He began to watch them. He would enter suddenly a room in\nwhich he knew they were, expecting to catch them in a compromising\nposition, or silently follow them to a secluded part of the garden. They\nwere chatting unconcernedly of trivial things. Laura greeted him with a\npleasant smile. He could put his finger on nothing to confirm his\ntorturing suspicions. He started to drink. He grew nervous and\nirritable. He had no proof, no proof whatever, that there was anything\nbetween them, and yet in his bones he was certain that they were\ngrossly, shockingly deceiving him. He brooded till he felt he was going\nmad. A dark aching fire within him consumed his being. On one of his\nvisits to Florence he bought a pistol. He made up his mind that if he\ncould have proof of what in his heart he was certain of, he would kill\nthem both.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI don't know what brought on the final catastrophe. All that came out at\nthe trial was that, driven beyond endurance, Tito had gone one night to\nhis father's room to have it out with him. His father mocked and laughed\nat him. They had a furious quarrel and Tito took out his pistol and shot\nthe count dead. Then he collapsed and fell, weeping hysterically, on his\nfather's body; the repeated shots brought Laura and the servants rushing\nin. He jumped up and grabbed the pistol, to shoot himself he said\nafterwards, but he hesitated or they were too quick for him, and they\nsnatched it out of his hand. The police were sent for. He spent most of\nhis time in prison weeping; he would not eat and had to be forcibly fed;\nhe told the examining magistrate that he had killed his father because\nhe was his wife's lover. Laura, examined and examined again, swore that\nthere had never been anything between the count and herself but a\nnatural affection. The murder filled the Florentine public with horror.\nThe Italians were convinced of her guilt, but her friends, English and\nAmerican, felt that she was incapable of the crime of which she was\naccused. They went about saying that Tito was neurotic and insanely\njealous and in his stupid way had mistaken her American freedom of\nbehaviour for a criminal passion. On the face of it Tito's charge was\nabsurd. Carlo di San Pietro was nearly thirty years older than she, an\nelderly man with white hair; who could suppose that there would have\nbeen anything between her and her father-in-law, when her husband was\nyoung, handsome and in love with her?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was in Harding's presence that she saw the examining magistrate and\nthe lawyers who had been engaged to defend Tito. They had decided to\nplead insanity. Experts for the defence examined him and decided that he\nwas insane, experts for the prosecution examined him and decided that he\nwas sane. The fact that he had bought a pistol three months before he\ncommitted the dreadful crime went to prove that it was premeditated. It\nwas discovered that he was deeply in debt and his creditors were\npressing him; the only means he had of settling with them was by selling\nthe villa, and his father's death put him in possession of it. There is\nno capital punishment in Italy, but murder with premeditation is\npunished by solitary confinement for life. On the approach of the trial\nthe lawyers came to Laura and told her that the only way in which Tito\ncould be saved from this was for her to admit in court that the count\nhad been her lover. Laura went very pale. Harding protested violently.\nHe said they had no right to ask her to perjure herself and ruin her\nreputation to save that shiftless, drunken gambler whom she had been so\nunfortunate as to marry. Laura remained silent for a while.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well,\" she said at last, \"if that's the only way to save him I'll\ndo it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHarding tried to dissuade her, but she was decided.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should never have a moment's peace if I knew that Tito had to spend\nthe rest of his life alone in a prison cell.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd that is what happened. The trial opened. She was called and under\noath stated that for more than a year her father-in-law had been her\nlover. Tito was declared insane and sent to an asylum. Laura wanted to\nleave Florence at once, but in Italy the preliminaries to a trial are\nendless and by then she was near her time. The Hardings insisted on her\nremaining with them till she was confined. She had a child, a boy, but\nit only lived twenty-four hours. Her plan was to go back to San\nFrancisco and live with her mother till she could find a job, for Tito's\nextravagance, the money she had spent on the villa, and then the cost of\nthe trial had seriously impoverished her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was Harding who told me most of this; but one day when he was at the\nclub and I was having a cup of tea with Bessie and we were again talking\nover these tragic happenings she said to me:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, Charley hasn't told you the whole story because he doesn't\nknow it. I never told him. Men are funny in some ways; they're much more\neasily shocked than women.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI raised my eyebrows, but said nothing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Just before Laura went away we had a talk. She was very low and I\nthought she was grieving over the loss of her baby. I wanted to say\nsomething to help her. 'You mustn't take the baby's death too hardly,' I\nsaid. 'As things are, perhaps it's better it died.' 'Why?' she said.\n'Think what the poor little thing's future would have been with a\nmurderer for his father.' She looked at me for a moment in that strange\nquiet way of hers. And then what d'you think she said?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't a notion,\" said I.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She said: 'What makes you think his father was a murderer?' I felt\nmyself grow as red as a turkey-cock, I could hardly believe my ears.\n'Laura, what <i>do</i> you mean?' I said. 'You were in court,' she said. 'You\nheard me say Carlo was my lover.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBessie Harding stared at me as she must have stared at Laura.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did you say then?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What was there for me to say? I said nothing. I wasn't so much\nhorrified, I was bewildered. Laura looked at me and, believe it or not,\nI'm convinced there was a twinkle in her eyes. I felt a perfect fool.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor Bessie,\" I smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPoor Bessie, I repeated to myself now as I thought of this strange\nstory. She and Charley were long since dead and by their death I had\nlost good friends. I went to sleep then, and next day Wyman Holt took me\nfor a long drive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe were to dine with the Greenes at seven and we reached their house on\nthe dot. Now that I had remembered who Laura was I was filled with an\nimmense curiosity to see her again. Wyman had exaggerated nothing. The\nliving-room into which we went was the quintessence of commonplace. It\nwas comfortable enough, but there was not a trace of personality in it.\nIt might have been furnished <i>en bloc</i> by a mail-order house. It had the\nbleakness of a government office. I was introduced first to my host\nJasper Greene and then to his brother Emery and to his brother's wife\nFanny. Jasper Greene was a large, plump man with a moon face and a shock\nof black, coarse, unkempt hair. He wore large cellulose-rimmed\nspectacles. I was staggered by his youth. He could not have been much\nover thirty and was therefore nearly twenty years younger than Laura.\nHis brother, Emery, a composer and teacher in a New York school of\nmusic, might have been seven or eight and twenty. His wife, a pretty\nlittle thing, was an actress for the moment out of a job. Jasper Greene\nmixed us some very adequate cocktails but for a trifle too much\nvermouth, and we sat down to dinner. The conversation was gay and even\nboisterous. Jasper and his brother were loud-voiced and all three of\nthem, Jasper, Emery and Emery's wife, were loquacious talkers. They\nchaffed one another, they joked and laughed; they discussed art,\nliterature, music and the theatre. Wyman and I joined in when we had a\nchance, which was not often; Laura did not try to. She sat at the head\nof the table, serene, with an amused, indulgent smile on her lips as she\nlistened to their scatter-brained nonsense; it was not stupid nonsense,\nmind you, it was intelligent and modern, but it was nonsense all the\nsame. There was something maternal in her attitude, and I was reminded\noddly of a sleek dachshund lying quietly in the sun while she looks\nlazily, and yet watchfully, at her litter of puppies romping round her.\nI wondered whether it crossed her mind that all this chatter about art\ndidn't amount to much when compared with those incidents of blood and\npassion that she remembered. But did she remember? It had all happened a\nlong time ago and perhaps it seemed no more than a bad dream. Perhaps\nthese commonplace surroundings were part of her deliberate effort to\nforget, and to be among these young people was restful to her spirit.\nPerhaps Jasper's clever stupidity was a comfort. After that searing\ntragedy it might be that she wanted nothing but the security of the\nhumdrum.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPossibly because Wyman was an authority on the Elizabethan drama the\nconversation at one moment touched on that. I had already discovered\nthat Jasper Greene was prepared to lay down the law on subjects all and\nsundry, and now he delivered himself as follows:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Our theatre has gone all to pot because the dramatists of our day are\nafraid to deal with the violent emotions which are the proper subject\nmatter of tragedy,\" he boomed. \"In the sixteenth century they had a\nwealth of melodramatic and bloody themes to suit their purpose and so\nthey produced great plays. But where can our playwrights look for\nthemes? Our Anglo-Saxon blood is too phlegmatic, too supine, to provide\nthem with material they can make anything of, and so they are condemned\nto occupy themselves with the trivialities of social intercourse.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI wondered what Laura thought of this, but I took care not to catch her\neye. She could have told them a story of illicit love, jealousy and\nparricide which would have been meat to one of Shakespeare's successors,\nbut had he treated it, I suppose he would have felt bound to finish it\nwith at least one more corpse strewn about the stage. The end of her\nstory, as I knew it now, was unexpected certainly, but sadly prosaic and\na trifle grotesque. Real life more often ends things with a whimper than\nwith a bang. I wondered too why she had gone out of her way to renew our\nold acquaintance. Of course she had no reason to suppose that I knew as\nmuch as I did; perhaps with a true instinct she was confident that I\nwould not give her away; perhaps she didn't care if I did. I stole a\nglance at her now and then while she was quietly listening to the\nexcited babbling of the three young people, but her friendly, pleasant\nface told me nothing. If I hadn't known otherwise I would have sworn\nthat no untoward circumstance had ever troubled the course of her\nuneventful life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe evening came to an end and this is the end of my story, but for the\nfun of it I am going to relate a small incident that happened when Wyman\nand I got back to his house. We decided to have a bottle of beer before\ngoing to bed and went into the kitchen to fetch it. The clock in the\nhall struck eleven and at that moment the phone rang. Wyman went to\nanswer it and when he came back was quietly chortling to himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's the joke?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was one of my students. They're not supposed to call members of the\nfaculty after ten-thirty, but he was all hot and bothered. He asked me\nhow evil had come into the world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And did you tell him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I told him that St. Thomas Aquinas had got hot and bothered too about\nthat very question and he'd better worry it out for himself. I said that\nwhen he found the solution he was to call me, no matter what time it\nwas. Two o'clock in the morning if he liked.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think you're pretty safe not to be disturbed for many a long night,\"\nI said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I won't conceal from you that I have formed pretty much the same\nimpression myself,\" he grinned.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThe lives of most men are determined by their environment. They accept\nthe circumstances amid which fate has thrown them not only with\nresignation but even with good will. They are like street-cars running\ncontentedly on their rails and they despise the sprightly flivver that\ndashes in and out of the traffic and speeds so jauntily across the open\ncountry. I respect them; they are good citizens, good husbands, and good\nfathers, and of course somebody has to pay the taxes; but I do not find\nthem exciting. I am fascinated by the men, few enough in all conscience,\nwho take life in their own hands and seem to mould it to their own\nliking. It may be that we have no such thing as free will, but at all\nevents we have the illusion of it. At a cross-road it does seem to us\nthat we might go either to the right or to the left and, the choice once\nmade, it is difficult to see that the whole course of the world's\nhistory obliged us to take the turning we did.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI never met a more interesting man than Mayhew. He was a lawyer in\nDetroit. He was an able and a successful one. By the time he was\nthirty-five he had a large and a lucrative practice, he had amassed a\ncompetence, and he stood on the threshold of a distinguished career. He\nhad an acute brain, an attractive personality, and uprightness. There\nwas no reason why he should not become, financially or politically, a\npower in the land. One evening he was sitting in his club with a group\nof friends and they were perhaps a little the worse (or the better) for\nliquor. One of them had recently come from Italy and he told them of a\nhouse he had seen at Capri, a house on the hill, overlooking the Bay of\nNaples, with a large and shady garden. He described to them the beauty\nof the most beautiful island in the Mediterranean.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It sounds fine,\" said Mayhew. \"Is that house for sale?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Everything is for sale in Italy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let's send 'em a cable and make an offer for it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What in heaven's name would you do with a house in Capri?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Live in it,\" said Mayhew.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sent for a cable form, wrote it out, and despatched it. In a few\nhours the reply came back. The offer was accepted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMayhew was no hypocrite and he made no secret of the fact that he would\nnever have done so wild a thing if he had been sober, but when he was he\ndid not regret it. He was neither an impulsive nor an emotional man, but\na very honest and sincere one. He would never have continued from\nbravado in a course that he had come to the conclusion was unwise. He\nmade up his mind to do exactly as he had said. He did not care for\nwealth and he had enough money on which to live in Italy. He thought he\ncould do more with life than spend it on composing the trivial quarrels\nof unimportant people. He had no definite plan. He merely wanted to get\naway from a life that had given him all it had to offer. I suppose his\nfriends thought him crazy; some must have done all they could to\ndissuade him. He arranged his affairs, packed up his furniture and\nstarted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCapri is a gaunt rock of austere outline, bathed in a deep blue sea; but\nits vineyards, green and smiling, give it a soft and easy grace. It is\nfriendly, remote and debonair. I find it strange that Mayhew should have\nsettled on this lovely island, for I never knew a man more insensible to\nbeauty. I do not know what he sought there: happiness, freedom, or\nmerely leisure; I know what he found. In this place which appeals so\nextravagantly to the senses he lived a life entirely of the spirit. For\nthe island is rich with historic associations and over it broods always\nthe enigmatic memory of Tiberius the Emperor. From his windows which\noverlooked the Bay of Naples, with the noble shape of Vesuvius changing\ncolour with the changing light, Mayhew saw a hundred places that\nrecalled the Romans and the Greeks. The past began to haunt him. All\nthat he saw for the first time, for he had never been abroad before,\nexcited his fancy; and in his soul stirred the creative imagination. He\nwas a man of energy. Presently he made up his mind to write a history.\nFor some time he looked about for a subject, and at last decided on the\nsecond century of the Roman Empire. It was little known and it seemed to\nhim to offer problems analogous with those of our own day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe began to collect books and soon he had an immense library. His legal\ntraining had taught him to read quickly. He settled down to work. At\nfirst he had been accustomed to foregather in the evening with the\npainters, writers and suchlike who met in the little tavern near the\nPiazza, but presently he withdrew himself, for his absorption in his\nstudies became more pressing. He had been accustomed to bathe in that\nbland sea and to take long walks among the pleasant vineyards, but\nlittle by little, grudging the time, he ceased to do so. He worked\nharder than he had ever worked in Detroit. He would start at noon and\nwork all through the night till the whistle of the steamer that goes\nevery morning from Capri to Naples told him that it was five o'clock and\ntime to go to bed. His subject opened out before him, vaster and more\nsignificant, and he imagined a work that would put him for ever beside\nthe great historians of the past. As the years went by he was to be\nfound seldom in the ways of men. He could be tempted to come out of his\nhouse only by a game of chess or the chance of an argument. He loved to\nset his brain against another's. He was widely read now, not only in\nhistory, but in philosophy and science; and he was a skilful\ncontroversialist, quick, logical and incisive. But he had good-humour\nand kindliness; though he took a very human pleasure in victory, he did\nnot exult in it to your mortification.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen first he came to the island he was a big, brawny fellow, with thick\nblack hair and a black beard, of a powerful physique; but gradually his\nskin became pale and waxy; he grew thin and frail. It was an odd\ncontradiction in the most logical of men that, though a convinced and\nimpetuous materialist, he despised the body; he looked upon it as a vile\ninstrument which he could force to do the spirit's bidding. Neither\nillness nor lassitude prevented him from going on with his work. For\nfourteen years he toiled unremittingly. He made thousands and thousands\nof notes. He sorted and classified them. He had his subject at his\nfinger ends, and at last was ready to begin. He sat down to write. He\ndied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe body that he, the materialist, had treated so contumeliously took\nits revenge on him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat vast accumulation of knowledge is lost for ever. Vain was that\nambition, surely not an ignoble one, to set his name beside those of\nGibbon and Mommsen. His memory is treasured in the hearts of a few\nfriends, fewer, alas! as the years pass on, and to the world he is\nunknown in death as he was in life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd yet to me his life was a success. The pattern is good and complete.\nHe did what he wanted, and he died when his goal was in sight and never\nknew the bitterness of an end achieved.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nMost people, the vast majority in fact, lead the lives that\ncircumstances have thrust upon them, and though some repine, looking\nupon themselves as round pegs in square holes, and think that if things\nhad been different they might have made a much better showing, the\ngreater part accept their lot, if not with serenity, at all events with\nresignation. They are like tram-cars travelling for ever on the selfsame\nrails. They go backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards,\ninevitably, till they can go no longer and then are sold as scrap-iron.\nIt is not often that you find a man who has boldly taken the course of\nhis life into his own hands. When you do, it is worth while having a\ngood look at him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat was why I was curious to meet Thomas Wilson. It was an interesting\nand a bold thing he had done. Of course the end was not yet and until\nthe experiment was concluded it was impossible to call it successful.\nBut from what I had heard it seemed he must be an odd sort of fellow and\nI thought I should like to know him. I had been told he was reserved,\nbut I had a notion that with patience and tact I could persuade him to\nconfide in me. I wanted to hear the facts from his own lips. People\nexaggerate, they love to romanticise, and I was quite prepared to\ndiscover that his story was not nearly so singular as I had been led to\nbelieve.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd this impression was confirmed when at last I made his acquaintance.\nIt was on the Piazza in Capri, where I was spending the month of August\nat a friend's villa, and a little before sunset, when most of the\ninhabitants, native and foreign, gather together to chat with their\nfriends in the cool of the evening. There is a terrace that overlooks\nthe Bay of Naples, and when the sun sinks slowly into the sea the island\nof Ischia is silhouetted against a blaze of splendour. It is one of the\nmost lovely sights in the world. I was standing there with my friend and\nhost watching it, when suddenly he said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look, there's Wilson.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The man sitting on the parapet, with his back to us. He's got a blue\nshirt on.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI saw an undistinguished back and a small head of grey hair short and\nrather thin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish he'd turn round,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He will presently.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ask him to come and have a drink with us at Morgano's.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe instant of overwhelming beauty had passed and the sun, like the top\nof an orange, was dipping into a wine-red sea. We turned round and\nleaning our backs against the parapet looked at the people who were\nsauntering to and fro. They were all talking their heads off and the\ncheerful noise was exhilarating. Then the church bell, rather cracked,\nbut with a fine resonant note, began to ring. The Piazza at Capri, with\nits clock tower over the footpath that leads up from the harbour, with\nthe church up a flight of steps, is a perfect setting for an opera by\nDonizetti, and you felt that the voluble crowd might at any moment break\nout into a rattling chorus. It was charming and unreal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was so intent on the scene that I had not noticed Wilson get off the\nparapet and come towards us. As he passed us my friend stopped him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa, Wilson, I haven't seen you bathing the last few days.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've been bathing on the other side for a change.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy friend then introduced me. Wilson shook hands with me politely, but\nwith indifference; a great many strangers come to Capri for a few days,\nor a few weeks, and I had no doubt he was constantly meeting people who\ncame and went; and then my friend asked him to come along and have a\ndrink with us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was just going back to supper,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can't it wait?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose it can,\" he smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThough his teeth were not very good his smile was attractive. It was\ngentle and kindly. He was dressed in a blue cotton shirt and a pair of\ngrey trousers, much creased and none too clean, of a thin canvas, and on\nhis feet he wore a pair of very old espadrilles. The get-up was\npicturesque, and very suitable to the place and the weather, but it did\nnot at all go with his face. It was a lined, long face, deeply\nsunburned, thin-lipped, with small grey eyes rather close together and\ntight, neat features. The grey hair was carefully brushed. It was not a\nplain face, indeed in his youth Wilson might have been good-looking, but\na prim one. He wore the blue shirt, open at the neck, and the grey\ncanvas trousers, not as though they belonged to him, but as though,\nshipwrecked in his pyjamas, he had been fitted out with odd garments by\ncompassionate strangers. Notwithstanding this careless attire he looked\nlike the manager of a branch office in an insurance company, who should\nby rights be wearing a black coat with pepper-and-salt trousers, a white\ncollar and an unobjectionable tie. I could very well see myself going to\nhim to claim the insurance money when I had lost a watch, and being\nrather disconcerted while I answered the questions he put to me by his\nobvious impression, for all his politeness, that people who made such\nclaims were either fools or knaves.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMoving off, we strolled across the Piazza and down the street till we\ncame to Morgano's. We sat in the garden. Around us people were talking\nin Russian, German, Italian and English. We ordered drinks. Donna Lucia,\nthe host's wife, waddled up and in her low, sweet voice passed the time\nof day with us. Though middle-aged now and portly, she had still traces\nof the wonderful beauty that thirty years before had driven artists to\npaint so many bad portraits of her. Her eyes, large and liquid, were the\neyes of Hera and her smile was affectionate and gracious. We three\ngossiped for a while, for there is always a scandal of one sort or\nanother in Capri to make a topic of conversation, but nothing was said\nof particular interest and in a little while Wilson got up and left us.\nSoon afterwards we strolled up to my friend's villa to dine. On the way\nhe asked me what I had thought of Wilson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing,\" I said. \"I don't believe there's a word of truth in your\nstory.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why not?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He isn't the sort of man to do that sort of thing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How does anyone know what anyone is capable of?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should put him down as an absolutely normal man of business who's\nretired on a comfortable income from gilt-edged securities. I think your\nstory's just the ordinary Capri tittle-tattle.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have it your own way,\" said my friend.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe were in the habit of bathing at a beach called the Baths of Tiberius.\nWe took a fly down the road to a certain point and then wandered through\nlemon groves and vineyards, noisy with cicadas and heavy with the hot\nsmell of the sun, till we came to the top of the cliff down which a\nsteep winding path led to the sea. A day or two later, just before we\ngot down my friend said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, there's Wilson back again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe scrunched over the beach, the only drawback to the bathing-place\nbeing that it was shingle and not sand, and as we came along Wilson saw\nus and waved. He was standing up, a pipe in his mouth, and he wore\nnothing but a pair of trunks. His body was dark brown, thin but not\nemaciated, and, considering his wrinkled face and grey hair, youthful.\nHot from our walk, we undressed quickly and plunged at once into the\nwater. Six feet from the shore it was thirty feet deep, but so clear\nthat you could see the bottom. It was warm, yet invigorating.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen I got out Wilson was lying on his belly, with a towel under him\nreading a book. I lit a cigarette and went and sat down beside him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Had a nice swim?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put his pipe inside his book to mark the place and closing it put it\ndown on the pebbles beside him. He was evidently willing to talk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Lovely,\" I said. \"It's the best bathing in the world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course people think those were the Baths of Tiberius.\" He waved his\nhand towards a shapeless mass of masonry that stood half in the water\nand half out. \"But that's all rot. It was just one of his villas, you\nknow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did. But it is just as well to let people tell you things when they\nwant to. It disposes them kindly towards you if you suffer them to\nimpart information. Wilson gave a chuckle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Funny old fellow, Tiberius. Pity they're saying now there's not a word\nof truth in all those stories about him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe began to tell me all about Tiberius. Well, I had read my Suetonius\ntoo and I had read histories of the Early Roman Empire, so there was\nnothing very new to me in what he said. But I observed that he was not\nill-read. I remarked on it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, well, when I settled down here I was naturally interested, and I\nhave plenty of time for reading. When you live in a place like this,\nwith all its associations, it seems to make history so actual. You might\nalmost be living in historical times yourself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI should remark here that this was in 1913. The world was an easy,\ncomfortable place and no one could have imagined that anything might\nhappen seriously to disturb the serenity of existence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How long have you been here?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fifteen years.\" He gave the blue and placid sea a glance, and a\nstrangely tender smile hovered on his thin lips. \"I fell in love with\nthe place at first sight. You've heard, I daresay, of the mythical\nGerman who came here on the Naples boat just for lunch and a look at the\nBlue Grotto and stayed forty years; well, I can't say I exactly did\nthat, but it's come to the same thing in the end. Only it won't be forty\nyears in my case. Twenty-five. Still, that's better than a poke in the\neye with a sharp stick.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI waited for him to go on. For what he had just said looked indeed as\nthough there might be something after all in the singular story I had\nheard. But at that moment my friend came dripping out of the water very\nproud of himself because he had swum a mile, and the conversation turned\nto other things.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter that I met Wilson several times, either in the Piazza or on the\nbeach. He was amiable and polite. He was always pleased to have a talk\nand I found out that he not only knew every inch of the island but also\nthe adjacent mainland. He had read a great deal on all sorts of\nsubjects, but his speciality was the history of Rome and on this he was\nvery well informed. He seemed to have little imagination and to be of no\nmore than average intelligence. He laughed a good deal, but with\nrestraint, and his sense of humour was tickled by simple jokes. A\ncommonplace man. I did not forget the odd remark he had made during the\nfirst short chat we had had by ourselves, but he never so much as\napproached the topic again. One day on our return from the beach,\ndismissing the cab at the Piazza, my friend and I told the driver to be\nready to take us up to Anacapri at five. We were going to climb Monte\nSolaro, dine at a tavern we favoured, and walk down in the moonlight.\nFor it was full moon and the views by night were lovely. Wilson was\nstanding by while we gave the cabman instructions, for we had given him\na lift to save him the hot dusty walk, and more from politeness than for\nany other reason I asked him if he would care to join us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's my party,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll come with pleasure,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut when the time came to set out my friend was not feeling well, he\nthought he had stayed too long in the water, and would not face the long\nand tiring walk. So I went alone with Wilson. We climbed the mountain,\nadmired the spacious view, and got back to the inn as night was falling,\nhot, hungry and thirsty. We had ordered our dinner beforehand. The food\nwas good, for Antonio was an excellent cook, and the wine came from his\nown vineyard. It was so light that you felt you could drink it like\nwater and we finished the first bottle with our macaroni. By the time we\nhad finished the second we felt that there was nothing much wrong with\nlife. We sat in a little garden under a great vine laden with grapes.\nThe air was exquisitely soft. The night was still and we were alone. The\nmaid brought us <i>bel paese</i> cheese and a plate of figs. I ordered coffee\nand strega, which is the best liqueur they make in Italy. Wilson would\nnot have a cigar, but lit his pipe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We've got plenty of time before we need start,\" he said, \"the moon\nwon't be over the hill for another hour.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Moon or no moon,\" I said briskly, \"of course we've got plenty of time.\nThat's one of the delights of Capri, that there's never any hurry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Leisure,\" he said. \"If people only knew! It's the most priceless thing\na man can have and they're such fools they don't even know it's\nsomething to aim at. Work? They work for work's sake. They haven't got\nthe brains to realise that the only object of work is to obtain\nleisure.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWine has the effect on some people of making them indulge in general\nreflections. These remarks were true, but no one could have claimed that\nthey were original. I did not say anything, but struck a match to light\nmy cigar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was full moon the first time I came to Capri,\" he went on\nreflectively. \"It might be the same moon as to-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was, you know,\" I smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe grinned. The only light in the garden was what came from an oil lamp\nthat hung over our heads. It had been scanty to eat by, but it was good\nnow for confidences.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't mean that. I mean, it might be yesterday. Fifteen years it is,\nand when I look back it seems like a month. I'd never been to Italy\nbefore. I came for my summer holiday. I went to Naples by boat from\nMarseilles and I had a look round, Pompeii, you know, and Paestum and\none or two places like that; then I came here for a week. I liked the\nlook of the place right away, from the sea, I mean, as I watched it come\ncloser and closer; and then when we got into the little boats from the\nsteamer and landed at the quay, with all that crowd of jabbering people\nwho wanted to take your luggage, and the hotel touts, and the tumbledown\nhouses on the Marina and the walk up to the hotel, and dining on the\nterrace--well, it just got me. That's the truth. I didn't know if I was\nstanding on my head or my heels. I'd never drunk Capri wine before, but\nI'd heard of it; I think I must have got a bit tight. I sat on that\nterrace after they'd all gone to bed and watched the moon over the sea,\nand there was Vesuvius with a great red plume of smoke rising up from\nit. Of course I know now that wine I drank was ink, Capri wine my eye,\nbut I thought it all right then. But it wasn't the wine that made me\ndrunk, it was the shape of the island and those jabbering people, the\nmoon and the sea and the oleander in the hotel garden. I'd never seen an\noleander before.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a long speech and it had made him thirsty. He took up his glass,\nbut it was empty. I asked him if he would have another stregna.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's sickly stuff. Let's have a bottle of wine. That's sound, that is,\npure juice of the grape and can't hurt anyone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI ordered more wine, and when it came filled the glasses. He took a long\ndrink and after a sigh of pleasure went on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Next day I found my way to the bathing-place we go to. Not bad bathing,\nI thought. Then I wandered about the island. As luck would have it,\nthere was a <i>festa</i> up at the Punta di Timberio and I ran straight into\nthe middle of it. An image of the Virgin and priests, acolytes swinging\ncensers, and a whole crowd of jolly, laughing, excited people, a lot of\nthem all dressed up. I ran across an Englishman there and asked him what\nit was all about. 'Oh, it's the feast of the Assumption,' he said, 'at\nleast that's what the Catholic Church says it is, but that's just their\nhanky-panky. It's the festival of Venus. Pagan, you know. Aphrodite\nrising from the sea and all that.' It gave me quite a funny feeling to\nhear him. It seemed to take one a long way back, if you know what I\nmean. After that I went down one night to have a look at the Faraglioni\nby moonlight. If the fates had wanted me to go on being a bank manager\nthey oughtn't to have let me take that walk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You were a bank manager, were you?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had been wrong about him, but not far wrong.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. I was manager of the Crawford Street branch of the York and City.\nIt was convenient for me because I lived up Hendon way. I could get from\ndoor to door in thirty-seven minutes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe puffed at his pipe and relit it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That was my last night, that was. I'd got to be back at the bank on\nMonday morning. When I looked at those two great rocks sticking out of\nthe water, with the moon above them, and all the little lights of the\nfishermen in their boats catching cuttlefish, all so peaceful and\nbeautiful, I said to myself, well, after all, why should I go back? It\nwasn't as if I had anyone dependent on me. My wife had died of bronchial\npneumonia four years before and the kid went to live with her\ngrandmother, my wife's mother. She was an old fool, she didn't look\nafter the kid properly and she got blood-poisoning, they amputated her\nleg, but they couldn't save her and she died, poor little thing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How terrible,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I was cut up at the time, though of course not so much as if the\nkid had been living with me, but I dare say it was a mercy. Not much\nchance for a girl with only one leg. I was sorry about my wife too. We\ngot on very well together. Though I don't know if it would have\ncontinued. She was the sort of woman who was always bothering about what\nother people'd think. She didn't like travelling. Eastbourne was her\nidea of a holiday. D'you know, I'd never crossed the Channel till after\nher death.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I suppose you've got other relations, haven't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"None. I was an only child. My father had a brother, but he went to\nAustralia before I was born. I don't think anyone could easily be more\nalone in the world than I am. There wasn't any reason I could see why I\nshouldn't do exactly what I wanted. I was thirty-four at that time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had told me he had been on the island for fifteen years. That would\nmake him forty-nine. Just about the age I should have given him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd been working since I was seventeen. All I had to look forward to\nwas doing the same old thing day after day till I retired on my pension.\nI said to myself, is it worth it? What's wrong with chucking it all up\nand spending the rest of my life down here? It was the most beautiful\nplace I'd ever seen. But I'd had a business training, I was cautious by\nnature. 'No,' I said, 'I won't be carried away like this, I'll go\nto-morrow like I said I would and think it over. Perhaps when I get back\nto London I'll think quite differently.' Damned fool, wasn't I? I lost a\nwhole year that way.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You didn't change your mind, then?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You bet I didn't. All the time I was working I kept thinking of the\nbathing here and the vineyards and the walks over the hills and the moon\nand the sea, and the Piazza in the evening when everyone walks about for\na bit of a chat after the day's work is over. There was only one thing\nthat bothered me: I wasn't sure if I was justified in not working like\neverybody else did. Then I read a sort of history book, by a man called\nMarion Crawford it was, and there was a story about Sybaris and Crotona.\nThere were two cities; and in Sybaris they just enjoyed life and had a\ngood time, and in Crotona they were hardy and industrious and all that.\nAnd one day the men of Crotona came over and wiped Sybaris out, and then\nafter a while a lot of other fellows came over from somewhere else and\nwiped Crotona out. Nothing remains of Sybaris, not a stone, and all\nthat's left of Crotona is just one column. That settled the matter for\nme.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It came to the same in the end, didn't it? And when you look back now,\nwho were the mugs?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not reply and he went on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The money was rather a bother. The bank didn't pension one off till\nafter thirty years' service, but if you retired before that they gave\nyou a gratuity. With that and what I'd got for the sale of my house and\nthe little I'd managed to save, I just hadn't enough to buy an annuity\nto last the rest of my life. It would have been silly to sacrifice\neverything so as to lead a pleasant life and not have a sufficient\nincome to make it pleasant. I wanted to have a little place of my own, a\nservant to look after me, enough to buy tobacco, decent food, books now\nand then, and something over for emergencies. I knew pretty well how\nmuch I needed. I found I had just enough to buy an annuity for\ntwenty-five years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You were thirty-five at the time?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. It would carry me on till I was sixty. After all, no one can be\ncertain of living longer than that, a lot of men die in their fifties,\nand by the time a man's sixty he's had the best of life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"On the other hand no one can be sure of dying at sixty,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I don't know. It depends on himself, doesn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In your place I should have stayed on at the bank till I was entitled\nto my pension.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have been forty-seven then. I shouldn't have been too old to\nenjoy my life here, I'm older than that now and I enjoy it as much as I\never did, but I should have been too old to experience the particular\npleasure of a young man. You know, you can have just as good a time at\nfifty as you can at thirty, but it's not the same sort of good time. I\nwanted to live the perfect life while I still had the energy and the\nspirit to make the most of it. Twenty-five years seemed a long time to\nme, and twenty-five years of happiness seemed worth paying something\npretty substantial for. I'd made up my mind to wait a year and I waited\na year. Then I sent in my resignation and as soon as they paid me my\ngratuity I bought the annuity and came on here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"An annuity for twenty-five years?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you never regretted?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never. I've had my money's worth already. And I've got ten years more.\nDon't you think after twenty-five years of perfect happiness one ought\nto be satisfied to call it a day?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not say in so many words what he would do then, but his intention\nwas clear. It was pretty much the story my friend had told me, but it\nsounded different when I heard it from his own lips. I stole a glance at\nhim. There was nothing about him that was not ordinary. No one, looking\nat that neat, prim face, could have thought him capable of an\nunconventional action. I did not blame him. It was his own life that he\nhad arranged in this strange manner, and I did not see why he should not\ndo what he liked with it. Still, I could not prevent the little shiver\nthat ran down my spine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Getting chilly?\" he smiled. \"We might as well start walking down. The\nmoon'll be up by now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBefore we parted Wilson asked me if I would like to go and see his house\none day; and two or three days later, finding out where he lived, I\nstrolled up to see him. It was a peasant's cottage, well away from the\ntown, in a vineyard, with a view of the sea. By the side of the door\ngrew a great oleander in full flower. There were only two small rooms, a\ntiny kitchen and a lean-to in which firewood could be kept. The bedroom\nwas furnished like a monk's cell, but the sitting-room, smelling\nagreeably of tobacco, was comfortable enough, with two large arm-chairs\nthat he had brought from England, a large roll-top desk, a cottage piano\nand crowded bookshelves. On the walls were framed engravings of pictures\nby G. F. Watts and Lord Leighton. Wilson told me that the house belonged\nto the owner of the vineyard who lived in another cottage higher up the\nhill, and his wife came in every day to do the rooms and the cooking. He\nhad found the place on his first visit to Capri, and taking it on his\nreturn for good had been there ever since. Seeing the piano and music\nopen on it, I asked him if he would play.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm no good, you know, but I've always been fond of music and I get a\nlot of fun out of strumming.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe sat down at the piano and played one of the movements from a\nBeethoven sonata. He did not play very well. I looked at his music,\nSchumann and Schubert, Beethoven, Bach and Chopin. On the table on which\nhe had his meals was a greasy pack of cards. I asked him if he played\npatience.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A lot.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFrom what I saw of him then and from what I heard from other people I\nmade for myself what I think must have been a fairly accurate picture of\nthe life he had led for the last fifteen years. It was certainly a very\nharmless one. He bathed; he walked a great deal, and he seemed never to\nlose his sense of the beauty of the island which he knew so intimately;\nhe played the piano and he played patience; he read. When he was asked\nto a party he went and, though a trifle dull, was agreeable. He was not\naffronted if he was neglected. He liked people, but with an aloofness\nthat prevented intimacy. He lived thriftily, but with sufficient\ncomfort. He never owed a penny. I imagine he had never been a man whom\nsex had greatly troubled, and if in his younger days he had had now and\nthen a passing affair with a visitor to the island whose head was turned\nby the atmosphere, his emotion, while it lasted, remained, I am pretty\nsure, well under his control. I think he was determined that nothing\nshould interfere with his independence of spirit. His only passion was\nfor the beauty of nature, and he sought felicity in the simple and\nnatural things that life offers to everyone. You may say that it was a\ngrossly selfish existence. It was. He was of no use to anybody, but on\nthe other hand he did nobody any harm. His only object was his own\nhappiness, and it looked as though he had attained it. Very few people\nknow where to look for happiness; fewer still find it. I don't know\nwhether he was a fool or a wise man. He was certainly a man who knew his\nown mind. The odd thing about him to me was that he was so immensely\ncommonplace. I should never have given him a second thought but for what\nI knew, that on a certain day, ten years from then, unless a chance\nillness cut the thread before, he must deliberately take leave of the\nworld he loved so well. I wondered whether it was the thought of this,\nnever quite absent from his mind, that gave him the peculiar zest with\nwhich he enjoyed every moment of the day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI should do him an injustice if I omitted to state that he was not at\nall in the habit of talking about himself. I think the friend I was\nstaying with was the only person in whom he had confided. I believe he\nonly told me the story because he suspected I already knew it, and on\nthe evening on which he told it me he had drunk a good deal of wine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy visit drew to a close and I left the island. The year after, war\nbroke out. A number of things happened to me, so that the course of my\nlife was greatly altered, and it was thirteen years before I went to\nCapri again. My friend had been back some time, but he was no longer so\nwell off, and had moved into a house that had no room for me; so I was\nputting up at the hotel. He came to meet me at the boat and we dined\ntogether. During dinner I asked him where exactly his house was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know it,\" he answered. \"It's the little place Wilson had. I've\nbuilt on a room and made it quite nice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith so many other things to occupy my mind I had not given Wilson a\nthought for years; but now, with a little shock, I remembered. The ten\nyears he had before him when I made his acquaintance must have elapsed\nlong ago.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did he commit suicide as he said he would?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's rather a grim story.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWilson's plan was all right. There was only one flaw in it and this, I\nsuppose, he could not have foreseen. It had never occurred to him that\nafter twenty-five years of complete happiness, in this quiet backwater,\nwith nothing in the world to disturb his serenity, his character would\ngradually lose its strength. The will needs obstacles in order to\nexercise its power; when it is never thwarted, when no effort is needed\nto achieve one's desires, because one has placed one's desires only in\nthe things that can be obtained by stretching out one's hand, the will\ngrows impotent. If you walk on a level all the time the muscles you need\nto climb a mountain will atrophy. These observations are trite, but\nthere they are. When Wilson's annuity expired he had no longer the\nresolution to make the end which was the price he had agreed to pay for\nthat long period of happy tranquillity. I do not think, as far as I\ncould gather, both from what my friend told me and afterwards from\nothers, that he wanted courage. It was just that he couldn't make up his\nmind. He put it off from day to day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had lived on the island for so long and had always settled his\naccounts so punctually that it was easy for him to get credit; never\nhaving borrowed money before, he found a number of people who were\nwilling to lend him small sums when now he asked for them. He had paid\nhis rent regularly for so many years that his landlord, whose wife\nAssunta still acted as his servant, was content to let things slide for\nseveral months. Everyone believed him when he said that a relative had\ndied and that he was temporarily embarrassed because owing to legal\nformalities he could not for some time get the money that was due to\nhim. He managed to hang on after this fashion for something over a year.\nThen he could get no more credit from the local tradesmen, and there was\nno one to lend him any more money. His landlord gave him notice to leave\nthe house unless he paid up the arrears of rent before a certain date.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe day before this he went into his tiny bedroom, closed the door and\nthe window, drew the curtain and lit a brazier of charcoal. Next morning\nwhen Assunta came to make his breakfast she found him insensible but\nstill alive. The room was draughty, and though he had done this and that\nto keep out the fresh air he had not done it very thoroughly. It almost\nlooked as though at the last moment, and desperate though his situation\nwas, he had suffered from a certain infirmity of purpose. Wilson was\ntaken to the hospital, and though very ill for some time he at last\nrecovered. But as a result either of the charcoal poisoning or of the\nshock he was no longer in complete possession of his faculties. He was\nnot insane, at all events not insane enough to be put in an asylum, but\nhe was quite obviously no longer in his right mind.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I went to see him,\" said my friend. \"I tried to get him to talk, but he\nkept looking at me in a funny sort of way, as though he couldn't quite\nmake out where he'd seen me before. He looked rather awful lying there\nin bed, with a week's growth of grey beard on his chin; but except for\nthat funny look in his eyes he seemed quite normal.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What funny look in his eyes?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know exactly how to describe it. Puzzled. It's an absurd\ncomparison, but suppose you threw a stone up into the air and it didn't\ncome down but just stayed there...\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be rather bewildering,\" I smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, that's the sort of look he had.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was difficult to know what to do with him. He had no money and no\nmeans of getting any. His effects were sold, but for too little to pay\nwhat he owed. He was English, and the Italian authorities did not wish\nto make themselves responsible for him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe British Consul in Naples had no funds to deal with the case. He\ncould of course be sent back to England, but no one seemed to know what\ncould be done with him when he got there. Then Assunta, the servant,\nsaid that he had been a good master and a good tenant, and as long as he\nhad the money had paid his way; he could sleep in the woodshed in the\ncottage in which she and her husband lived, and he could share their\nmeals. This was suggested to him. It was difficult to know whether he\nunderstood or not. When Assunta came to take him from the hospital he\nwent with her without remark. He seemed to have no longer a will of his\nown. She had been keeping him now for two years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not very comfortable, you know,\" said my friend. \"They've rigged\nhim up a ramshackle bed and given him a couple of blankets, but there's\nno window, and it's icy cold in winter and like an oven in summer. And\nthe food's pretty rough. You know how these peasants eat: macaroni on\nSundays and meat once in a blue moon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does he do with himself all the time?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He wanders about the hills. I've tried to see him two or three times,\nbut it's no good; when he sees you coming he runs like a hare. Assunta\ncomes down to have a chat with me now and then and I give her a bit of\nmoney so that she can buy him tobacco, but God knows if he ever gets\nit.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do they treat him all right?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sure Assunta's kind enough. She treats him like a child. I'm afraid\nher husband's not very nice to him. He grudges the cost of his keep. I\ndon't believe he's cruel or anything like that, but I think he's a bit\nsharp with him. He makes him fetch water and clean the cow-shed and that\nsort of thing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It sounds pretty rotten,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He brought it on himself. After all, he's only got what he deserved.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think on the whole we all get what we deserve,\" I said. \"But that\ndoesn't prevent its being rather horrible.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTwo or three days later my friend and I were taking a walk. We were\nstrolling along a narrow path through an olive grove.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's Wilson,\" said my friend suddenly. \"Don't look, you'll only\nfrighten him. Go straight on.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI walked with my eyes on the path, but out of the corners of them I saw\na man hiding behind an olive tree. He did not move as we approached, but\nI felt that he was watching us. As soon as we had passed I heard a\nscamper. Wilson, like a hunted animal, had made for safety. That was the\nlast I ever saw of him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe died last year. He had endured that life for six years. He was found\none morning on the mountainside lying quite peacefully as though he had\ndied in his sleep. From where he lay he had been able to see those two\ngreat rocks called the Faraglioni which stand out of the sea. It was\nfull moon and he must have gone to see them by moonlight. Perhaps he\ndied of the beauty of that sight.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI wonder if I can do it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI knew Salvatore first when he was a boy of fifteen with a pleasant,\nugly face, a laughing mouth and care-free eyes. He used to spend the\nmorning lying about the beach with next to nothing on and his brown body\nwas as thin as a rail. He was full of grace. He was in and out of the\nsea all the time, swimming with the clumsy, effortless stroke common to\nthe fisher boys. Scrambling up the jagged rocks on his hard feet, for\nexcept on Sundays he never wore shoes, he would throw himself into the\ndeep water with a cry of delight. His father was a fisherman who owned\nhis own little vineyard and Salvatore acted as nursemaid to his two\nyounger brothers. He shouted to them to come inshore when they ventured\nout too far and made them dress when it was time to climb the hot,\nvineclad hill for the frugal midday meal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut boys in those Southern parts grow apace and in a little while he was\nmadly in love with a pretty girl who lived on the Grande Marina. She had\neyes like forest pools and held herself like a daughter of the Cæsars.\nThey were affianced, but they could not marry till Salvatore had done\nhis military service, and when he left the island which he had never\nleft in his life before, to become a sailor in the navy of King Victor\nEmmanuel, he wept like a child. It was hard for one who had never been\nless free than the birds to be at the beck and call of others; it was\nharder still to live in a battleship with strangers instead of in a\nlittle white cottage among the vines; and when he was ashore, to walk in\nnoisy, friendless cities with streets so crowded that he was frightened\nto cross them, when he had been used to silent paths and the mountains\nand the sea. I suppose it had never struck him that Ischia, which he\nlooked at every evening (it was like a fairy island in the sunset) to\nsee what the weather would be like next day, or Vesuvius, pearly in the\ndawn, had anything to do with him at all; but when he ceased to have\nthem before his eyes he realised in some dim fashion that they were as\nmuch part of him as his hands and his feet. He was dreadfully homesick.\nBut it was hardest of all to be parted from the girl he loved with all\nhis passionate young heart. He wrote to her (in his childlike\nhandwriting) long, ill-spelt letters in which he told her how constantly\nhe thought of her and how much he longed to be back. He was sent here\nand there, to Spezzia, to Venice, to Bari and finally to China. Here he\nfell ill of some mysterious ailment that kept him in hospital for\nmonths. He bore it with the mute and uncomprehending patience of a dog.\nWhen he learnt that it was a form of rheumatism that made him unfit for\nfurther service his heart exulted, for he could go home; and he did not\nbother, in fact he scarcely listened, when the doctors told him that he\nwould never again be quite well. What did he care when he was going back\nto the little island he loved so well and the girl who was waiting for\nhim?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen he got into the rowing-boat that met the steamer from Naples and\nwas rowed ashore he saw his father and mother standing on the jetty and\nhis two brothers, big boys now, and he waved to them. His eyes searched\namong the crowd that waited there, for the girl. He could not see her.\nThere was a great deal of kissing when he jumped up the steps and they\nall, emotional creatures, cried a little as they exchanged their\ngreetings. He asked where the girl was. His mother told him that she did\nnot know; they had not seen her for two or three weeks; so in the\nevening when the moon was shining over the placid sea and the lights of\nNaples twinkled in the distance he walked down to the Grande Marina to\nher house. She was sitting on the doorstep with her mother. He was a\nlittle shy because he had not seen her for so long. He asked her if she\nhad not received the letter that he had written to her to say that he\nwas coming home. Yes, they had received a letter, and they had been told\nby another of the island boys that he was ill. Yes, that was why he was\nback; was it not a piece of luck? Oh, but they had heard that he would\nnever be quite well again. The doctors talked a lot of nonsense, but he\nknew very well that now he was home again he would recover. They were\nsilent for a little, and then the mother nudged the girl. She did not\ntry to soften the blow. She told him straight out, with the blunt\ndirectness of her race, that she could not marry a man who would never\nbe strong enough to work like a man. They had made up their minds, her\nmother and father and she, and her father would never give his consent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Salvatore went home he found that they all knew. The girl's father\nhad been to tell them what they had decided, but they had lacked the\ncourage to tell him themselves. He wept on his mother's bosom. He was\nterribly unhappy, but he did not blame the girl. A fisherman's life is\nhard and it needs strength and endurance. He knew very well that a girl\ncould not afford to marry a man who might not be able to support her.\nHis smile was very sad and his eyes had the look of a dog that has been\nbeaten, but he did not complain, and he never said a hard word of the\ngirl he had loved so well. Then, a few months later, when he had settled\ndown to the common round, working in his father's vineyard and fishing,\nhis mother told him that there was a young woman in the village who was\nwilling to marry him. Her name was Assunta.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's as ugly as the devil,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was older than he, twenty-four or twenty-five, and she had been\nengaged to a man who, while doing his military service, had been killed\nin Africa. She had a little money of her own and if Salvatore married\nher she could buy him a boat of his own and they could take a vineyard\nthat by a happy chance happened at that moment to be without a tenant.\nHis mother told him that Assunta had seen him at the <i>festa</i> and had\nfallen in love with him. Salvatore smiled his sweet smile and said he\nwould think about it. On the following Sunday, dressed in the stiff\nblack clothes in which he looked so much less well than in the ragged\nshirt and trousers of every day, he went up to High Mass at the parish\nchurch and placed himself so that he could have a good look at the young\nwoman. When he came down again he told his mother that he was willing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWell, they were married and they settled down in a tiny whitewashed\nhouse in the middle of a handsome vineyard. Salvatore was now a great\nbig husky fellow, tall and broad, but still with that ingenuous smile\nand those trusting, kindly eyes that he had had as a boy. He had the\nmost beautiful manners I have ever seen in my life. Assunta was a\ngrim-visaged female, with decided features, and she looked old for her\nyears. But she had a good heart and she was no fool. I used to be amused\nby the little smile of devotion that she gave her husband when he was\nbeing very masculine and masterful; she never ceased to be touched by\nhis gentle sweetness. But she could not bear the girl who had thrown him\nover, and notwithstanding Salvatore's smiling expostulations she had\nnothing but harsh words for her. Presently children were born to them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a hard enough life. All through the fishing season towards\nevening he set out in his boat with one of his brothers for the fishing\ngrounds. It was a long pull of six or seven miles, and he spent the\nnight catching the profitable cuttlefish. Then there was the long row\nback again in order to sell the catch in time for it to go on the early\nboat to Naples. At other times he was working in his vineyard from dawn\ntill the heat drove him to rest and then again, when it was a trifle\ncooler, till dusk. Often his rheumatism prevented him from doing\nanything at all and then he would lie about the beach, smoking\ncigarettes, with a pleasant word for everyone notwithstanding the pain\nthat racked his limbs. The foreigners who came down to bathe and saw him\nthere said that these Italian fishermen were lazy devils.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSometimes he used to bring his children down to give them a bath. They\nwere both boys and at this time the elder was three and the younger less\nthan two. They sprawled about at the water's edge stark naked and\nSalvatore standing on a rock would dip them in the water. The elder one\nbore it with stoicism, but the baby screamed lustily. Salvatore had\nenormous hands, like legs of mutton, coarse and hard from constant toil,\nbut when he bathed his children, holding them so tenderly, drying them\nwith delicate care, upon my word they were like flowers. He would seat\nthe naked baby on the palm of his hand and hold him up, laughing a\nlittle at his smallness, and his laugh was like the laughter of an\nangel. His eyes then were as candid as his child's.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI started by saying that I wondered if I could do it and now I must tell\nyou what it is that I have tried to do. I wanted to see whether I could\nhold your attention for a few pages while I drew for you the portrait of\na man, just an ordinary fisherman who possessed nothing in the world\nexcept a quality which is the rarest, the most precious and the\nloveliest that anyone can have. Heaven only knows why he should so\nstrangely and unexpectedly have possessed it. All I know is that it\nshone in him with a radiance that, if it had not been so unconscious and\nso humble, would have been to the common run of men hardly bearable. And\nin case you have not guessed what the quality was, I will tell you.\nGoodness, just goodness.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nPositano stands on the side of a steep hill, a disarray of huddled white\nhouses, their tiled roofs washed pale by the suns of a hundred years;\nbut unlike many of these Italian towns perched out of harm's way on a\nrocky eminence it does not offer you at one delightful glance all it has\nto give. It has quaint streets that zig-zag up the hill and battered,\npainted houses in the baroque style, but very late, in which Neapolitan\nnoblemen led for a season, lives of penurious grandeur. It is indeed\nalmost excessively picturesque and in winter its two or three modest\nhotels are crowded with painters, male and female, who in their\ndifferent ways acknowledge by their daily labours the emotion it has\nexcited in them. Some take infinite pains to place on canvas every\nwindow and every tile their peering eyes can discover and doubtless\nachieve the satisfaction that rewards honest industry. \"At all events\nit's sincere,\" they say modestly when they show you their work. Some,\nrugged and dashing, in a fine frenzy attack their canvas with a pallet\nknife charged with a wad of paint, and they say: \"You see, what I was\ntrying to bring out was my personality.\" They slightly close their eyes\nand tentatively murmur: \"I think it's rather me, don't you?\" And there\nare some who give you highly entertaining arrangements of spheres and\ncubes and utter sombrely: \"That's how I see it!\" These for the most part\nare strong silent men who waste no words.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Positano looks full south and the chances are that in summer you\nwill have it to yourself. The hotel is clean and cool and there is a\nterrace, overhung with vines, where you can sit at night and look at the\nsea bespangled with dim stars. Down at the Marina, on the quay, is a\nlittle tavern where you can dine under an archway off anchovies and ham,\nmacaroni and fresh-caught mullet, and drink cold wine. Once a day the\nsteamer from Naples comes in, bringing the mail, and for a quarter of an\nhour gives the beach (there is no port and the passengers are landed in\nsmall boats) an air of animation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne August, tiring of Capri where I had been staying, I made up my mind\nto spend a few days at Positano, so I hired a fishing-boat and rowed\nover. I stopped on the way in a shady cove to bathe and lunch and sleep,\nand did not arrive till evening. I strolled up the hill, my two bags\nfollowing me on the heads of two sturdy women, to the hotel, and was\nsurprised to learn that I was not its only guest. The waiter, whose name\nwas Giuseppe, was an old friend of mine, and at that season he was\nboots, porter, chamber-maid and cook as well. He told me that an\nAmerican signore had been staying there for three months.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is he a painter or a writer or something?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, <i>Signore</i>, he's a gentleman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOdd, I thought. No foreigners came to Positano at that time of year but\nGerman <i>Wandervögel</i>, looking hot and dusty, with satchels on their\nbacks, and they only stayed overnight. I could not imagine anyone\nwishing to spend three months there; unless of course he were hiding.\nAnd since all London had been excited by the flight earlier in the year\nof an eminent, but dishonest, financier, the amusing thought occurred to\nme that this mysterious stranger was perhaps he. I knew him slightly and\ntrusted that my sudden arrival would not disconcert him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll see the <i>Signore</i> at the Marina,\" said Giuseppe, as I was\nsetting out to go down again. \"He always dines there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was certainly not there when I arrived. I asked what there was for\ndinner and drank an americano, which is by no means a bad substitute for\na cocktail. In a few minutes, however, a man walked in who could be no\nother than my fellow-guest at the hotel and I had a moment's\ndisappointment when I saw that it was not the absconding financier. A\ntall, elderly man, bronzed after his summer on the Mediterranean, with a\nhandsome, thin face. He wore a very neat, even smart, suit of\ncream-coloured silk and no hat. His grey hair was cut very short, but\nwas still thick. There was ease in his bearing, and elegance. He looked\nround the half-dozen tables under the archway at which the natives of\nthe place were playing cards or dominoes and his eyes rested on me. They\nsmiled pleasantly. He came up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hear you have just arrived at the hotel. Giuseppe suggested that as\nhe couldn't come down here to effect an introduction you wouldn't mind\nif I introduced myself. Would it bore you to dine with a total\nstranger?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course not. Sit down.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned to the maid who was laying a cover for me and in beautiful\nItalian told her that I would eat with him. He looked at my americano.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have got them to stock a little gin and French vermouth for me. Would\nyou allow me to mix you a very dry Martini?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Without hesitation.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It gives an exotic note to the surroundings which brings out the local\ncolour.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe certainly made a very good cocktail and with added appetite we ate\nthe ham and anchovies with which our dinner began. My host had a\npleasant humour and his fluent conversation was agreeable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must forgive me if I talk too much,\" he said presently. \"This is\nthe first chance I've had to speak English for three months. I don't\nsuppose you will stay here long and I mean to make the most of it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Three months is a long time to stay at Positano.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've hired a boat and I bathe and fish. I read a great deal. I have a\ngood many books here and if there's anything I can lend you I shall be\nvery glad.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I have enough reading matter. But I should love to look at what\nyou have. It's always fun looking at other people's books.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave me a sharp look and his eyes twinkled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It also tells you a good deal about them,\" he murmured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen we finished dinner we went on talking. The stranger was well-read\nand interested in a diversity of topics. He spoke with so much knowledge\nof painting that I wondered if he was an art critic or a dealer. But\nthen it appeared that he had been reading Suetonius and I came to the\nconclusion that he was a college professor. I asked him his name.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Barnaby,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's a name that has recently acquired an amazing celebrity.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, how so?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you never heard of the celebrated Mrs. Barnaby? She's a compatriot\nof yours.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I admit that I've seen her name in the papers rather frequently of\nlate. Do you know her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, quite well. She gave the grandest parties all last season and I\nwent to them whenever she asked me. Everyone did. She's an astounding\nwoman. She came to London to do the season, and, by George, she did it.\nShe just swept everything before her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I understand she's very rich?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fabulously, I believe, but it's not that that has made her success.\nPlenty of American women have money. Mrs. Barnaby has got where she has\nby sheer force of character. She never pretends to be anything but what\nshe is. She's natural. She's priceless. You know her history, of\ncourse?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy friend smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Barnaby may be a great celebrity in London, but to the best of my\nbelief in America she is almost inconceivably unknown.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI smiled also, but within me; I could well imagine how shocked this\ndistinguished and cultured man would be by the rollicking humour, the\nfrankness, with its tang of the soil, and the rich and vital experience\nof the amazing Mrs. Barnaby.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'll tell you about her. Her husband appears to be a very rough\ndiamond; he's a great hulking fellow, she says, who could fell a steer\nwith his fist. He's known in Arizona as One-Bullet Mike.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good gracious! Why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, years ago in the old days he killed two men with a single shot.\nShe says he's handier with his gun even now than any man West of the\nRockies. He's a miner, but he's been a cowpuncher, a gun-runner and God\nknows what in his day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A thoroughly Western type,\" said my professor a trifle acidly, I\nthought.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Something of a desperado, I imagine. Mrs. Barnaby's stories about him\nare a real treat. Of course everyone's been begging her to let him come\nover, but she says he'd never leave the wide open spaces. He struck oil\na year or two ago and now he's got all the money in the world. He must\nbe a great character. I've heard her keep the whole dinner-table\nspellbound when she's talked of the old days when they roughed it\ntogether. It gives you quite a thrill when you see this grey-haired\nwoman, not at all pretty, but exquisitely dressed, with the most\nwonderful pearls, and hear her tell how she washed the miners' clothes\nand cooked for the camp. Your American women have an adaptability that's\nreally stupendous. When you see Mrs. Barnaby sitting at the head of her\ntable, perfectly at home with princes of the blood, ambassadors, cabinet\nministers and the duke of this and the duke of that, it seems almost\nincredible that only a few years ago she was cooking the food of seventy\nminers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can she read or write?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose her invitations are written by her secretary, but she's by no\nmeans an ignorant woman. She told me she used to make a point of reading\nfor an hour every night after the fellows in camp had gone to bed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Remarkable!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"On the other hand One-Bullet Mike only learnt to write his name when he\nsuddenly found himself under the necessity of signing cheques.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe walked up the hill to our hotel and before separating for the night\narranged to take our luncheon with us next day and row over to a cove\nthat my friend had discovered. We spent a charming day bathing, reading,\neating, sleeping and talking, and we dined together in the evening. The\nfollowing morning, after breakfast on the terrace, I reminded Barnaby of\nhis promise to show me his books.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come right along.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI accompanied him to his bedroom, where Giuseppe, the waiter, was making\nhis bed. The first thing I caught sight of was a photograph in a\ngorgeous frame of the celebrated Mrs. Barnaby. My friend caught sight of\nit too and suddenly turned pale with anger.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You fool, Giuseppe. Why have you taken that photograph out of my\nwardrobe? Why the devil did you think I put it away?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know, Signore. That's why I put it back on the <i>Signore's</i>\ntable. I thought he liked to see the portrait of his <i>signora</i>.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI was staggered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is my Mrs. Barnaby your wife?\" I cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She is.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good Lord, are you One-Bullet Mike?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do I look it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI began to laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm bound to say you don't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI glanced at his hands. He smiled grimly and held them out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, sir, I have never felled a steer with my naked fist.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a moment we stared at one another in silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She'll never forgive me,\" he moaned. \"She wanted me to take a false\nname, and when I wouldn't she was quite vexed with me. She said it\nwasn't safe. I said it was bad enough to hide myself in Positano for\nthree months, but I'd be damned if I'd use any other name than my own.\"\nHe hesitated. \"I throw myself on your mercy. I can do nothing but trust\nto your generosity not to disclose a secret that you have discovered by\nthe most unlikely chance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will be as silent as the grave, but honestly I don't understand. What\ndoes it all mean?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am a doctor by profession and for the last thirty years my wife and I\nhave lived in Pennsylvania. I don't know if I have struck you as a\nroughneck, but I venture to say that Mrs. Barnaby is one of the most\ncultivated women I have ever known. Then a cousin of hers died and left\nher a very large fortune. There's no mistake about that. My wife is a\nvery, very rich woman. She has always read a great deal of English\nfiction and her one desire was to have a London season and entertain and\ndo all the grand things she had read about in books. It was her money\nand although the prospect did not particularly tempt me, I was very glad\nthat she should gratify her wish. We sailed last April. The young Duke\nand Duchess of Hereford happened to be on board.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know. It was they who first launched Mrs. Barnaby. They were crazy\nabout her. They've boomed her like an army of press-agents.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was ill when we sailed, I had a carbuncle which confined me to my\nstateroom, and Mrs. Barnaby was left to look after herself. Her\ndeck-chair happened to be next the duchess's, and from a remark she\noverheard it occurred to her that the English aristocracy were not so\nwrapped up in our social leaders as one might have expected. My wife is\na quick little woman and she remarked to me that if you had an ancestor\nwho signed Magna Carta perhaps you were not excessively impressed\nbecause the grandfather of one of your acquaintances sold skunks and the\ngrandfather of another ran ferryboats. My wife has a very keen sense of\nhumour. Getting into conversation with the duchess, she told her a\nlittle Western anecdote, and to make it more interesting told it as\nhaving happened to herself. Its success was immediate. The duchess\nbegged for another and my wife ventured a little further. Twenty-four\nhours later she had the duke and duchess eating out of her hand. She\nused to come down to my stateroom at intervals and tell me of her\nprogress. In the innocence of my heart I was tickled to death and since\nI had nothing else to do, I sent to the library for the works of Bret\nHarte and primed her with effective touches.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI slapped my forehead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We said she was as good as Bret Harte,\" I cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I had a grand time thinking of the consternation of my wife's friends\nwhen at the end of the voyage I appeared and we told them the truth. But\nI reckoned without my wife. The day before we reached Southampton Mrs.\nBarnaby told me that the Herefords were arranging parties for her. The\nduchess was crazy to introduce her to all sorts of wonderful people. It\nwas a chance in a thousand; but of course I should spoil everything, she\nadmitted that she had been forced by the course of events to represent\nme as very different from what I was. I did not know that she had\nalready transformed me into One-Bullet Mike, but I had a shrewd\nsuspicion that she had forgotten to mention that I was on board. Well,\nto make a long story short, she asked me to go to Paris for a week or\ntwo till she had consolidated her position. I didn't mind that. I was\nmuch more inclined to do a little work at the Sorbonne than to go to\nparties in Mayfair, and so leaving her to go on to Southampton, I got\noff at Cherbourg. But when I had been in Paris ten days she flew over to\nsee me. She told me that her success had exceeded her wildest dreams: it\nwas ten times more wonderful than any of the novels; but my appearance\nwould ruin it all. Very well, I said, I would stay in Paris. She didn't\nlike the idea of that; she said she'd never have a moment's peace so\nlong as I was so near and I might run across someone who knew me. I\nsuggested Vienna or Rome. They wouldn't do either, and at last I came\nhere and here have I been hiding like a criminal for three interminable\nmonths.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mean to say you never killed the two gamblers, shooting one with\nyour right hand and the other with your left?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sir, I have never fired a pistol in my life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what about the attack on your log-cabin by the Mexican bandits when\nyour wife loaded your guns for you and you stood the siege for three\ndays till the Federal troops rescued you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Barnaby smiled grimly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I never heard that one. Isn't it a trifle crude?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Crude! It was as good as any Wild West picture.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If I may venture a guess, that is where my wife in all probability got\nthe idea.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But the wash-tub. Washing the miners' clothes and all that. You don't\nknow how she made us roar with that story. Why, she swam into London\nSociety in her wash-tub.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI began to laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's made the most gorgeous fools of us all,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's made a pretty considerable fool of me, I would have you observe,\"\nremarked Mr. Barnaby.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She's a marvellous woman and you're right to be proud of her. I always\nsaid she was priceless. She realised the passion for romance that beats\nin every British heart and she's given us exactly what we wanted. I\nwouldn't betray her for worlds.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's all very fine for you, sir. London may have gained a wonderful\nhostess, but I'm beginning to think that I have lost a perfectly good\nwife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The only place for One-Bullet Mike is the great open West. My dear Mr.\nBarnaby, there is only one course open to you now. You must continue to\ndisappear.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm very much obliged to you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI thought he replied with a good deal of acidity.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nSt. Laurent de Maroni is a pretty little place. It is neat and clean. It\nhas an Hôtel de Ville and a Palais de Justice of which many a town in\nFrance would be proud. The streets are wide, and the fine trees that\nborder them give a grateful shade. The houses look as though they had\njust had a coat of paint. Many of them nestle in little gardens, and in\nthe gardens are palm trees and flame of the forest; cannas flaunt their\nbright colours and crotons their variety; the bougainvilleas, purple or\nred, riot profusely, and the elegant hibiscus offers its gorgeous\nflowers with a negligence that seems almost affected. St. Laurent de\nMaroni is the centre of the French penal settlements of Guiana, and a\nhundred yards from the quay at which you land is the great gateway of\nthe prison camp. These pretty little houses in their tropical gardens\nare the residence of the prison officials, and if the streets are neat\nand clean it is because there is no lack of convicts to keep them so.\nOne day, walking with a casual acquaintance, I came upon a young man, in\nthe round straw hat and the pink and white stripes of the convict's\nuniform, who was standing by the road-side with a pick. He was doing\nnothing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why are you idling?\" my companion asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe man gave his shoulders a scornful shrug.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Look at the blade of grass there,\" he answered. \"I've got twenty years\nto scratch it away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSt. Laurent de Maroni exists for the group of prison camps of which it\nis the centre. Such trade as it has depends on them; its shops, kept by\nChinese, are there to satisfy the wants of the warders, the doctors and\nthe numerous officials who are connected with the penal settlements. The\nstreets are silent and deserted. You pass a convict with a dispatch-case\nunder his arm; he has some job in the administration; or another with a\nbasket; he is a servant in somebody's house. Sometimes you come upon a\nlittle group in the charge of a warder; often you see them strolling to\nor from the prison unguarded. The prison gates are open all day long and\nthe prisoners freely saunter in and out. If you see a man not in the\nprison uniform he is probably a freed man who is condemned to spend a\nnumber of years in the colony and who, unable to get work, living on the\nedge of starvation, is drinking himself to death on the cheap strong rum\nwhich is called tafia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere is an hotel at St. Laurent de Maroni and here I had my meals. I\nsoon got to know by sight the habitual frequenters. They came in and sat\neach at his little table, ate their meals in silence and went out again.\nThe hotel was kept by a coloured woman, and the man she lived with, an\nex-convict, was the only waiter. But the Governor of the colony, who\nlives at Cayenne, had put at my disposal his own bungalow and it was\nthere I slept. An old Arab looked after it; he was a devout Mahommedan,\nand at intervals during the day I heard him say his prayers. To make my\nbed, keep my rooms tidy and run errands for me, the commandant of the\nprison had assigned me another convict. Both were serving life sentences\nfor murder; the commandant told me that I could place entire confidence\nin them; they were as honest as the day, and I could leave anything\nabout without the slightest risk. But I will not conceal from the reader\nthat when I went to bed at night I took the precaution to lock my door\nand to bolt my shutters. It was foolish no doubt, but I slept more\ncomfortably.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had come with letters of introduction, and both the governor of the\nprison settlements and the commandant of the camp at St. Laurent did\neverything they could to make my visit agreeable and instructive. I will\nnot here narrate all I heard and saw. I am not a reporter. It is not my\nbusiness to attack or to defend the system which the French have thought\nfit to adopt in regard to their criminals. Besides, the system is now\ncondemned; prisoners will soon cease to be sent out to French Guiana, to\nsuffer the illnesses incidental to the climate and the work in malarial\njungles to which so many are relegated, to endure nameless degradations,\nto lose hope, to rot, to die. I will only say that I saw no physical\ncruelty. On the other hand I saw no attempt to make the criminal on the\nexpiration of his sentence a useful citizen. I saw nothing done for his\nspiritual welfare. I heard nothing of classes that he could attend in\norder to improve his education or organised games that might distract\nhis mind. I saw no library where he could get books to read when his\nday's work was done. I saw a condition of affairs that only the\nstrongest character could hope to surmount. I saw a brutishness that\nmust reduce all but a very few to apathy and despair.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAll this has nothing to do with me. It is vain to torment oneself over\nsufferings that one cannot alleviate. My object here is to tell a story.\nAs I am well aware, one can never know everything there is to be known\nabout human nature. One can be sure only of one thing, and that is that\nit will never cease to have a surprise in store for you. When I had got\nover the impression of bewilderment, surprise and horror to which my\nfirst visit to the prison camp gave rise, I bethought myself that there\nwere certain matters that I was interested to enquire into. I should\ninform the reader that three-quarters of the convicts at St. Laurent de\nMaroni are there for murder. This is not official information and it may\nbe that I exaggerate; every prisoner has a little book in which are set\ndown his crime, his sentence, his punishments, and whatever else the\nauthorities think necessary to keep note of; and it was from an\nexamination of a considerable number of these that I formed my estimate.\nIt gave me something of a shock to realise that in England far, far the\ngreater number of these men whom I saw working in shops, lounging about\nthe verandahs of their dormitories or sauntering through the streets\nwould have suffered capital punishment. I found them not at all\ndisinclined to speak of the crime for which they had been convicted, and\nin pursuance of my purpose I spent the better part of one day inquiring\ninto crimes of passion. I wanted to know exactly what was the motive\nthat had made a man kill his wife or his girl. I had a notion that\njealousy and wounded honour might not perhaps tell the whole story. I\ngot some curious replies, and among them one that was not to my mind\nlacking in humour. This was from a man working in the carpenter's shop\nwho had cut his wife's throat; when I asked him why he had done it, he\nanswered with a shrug of the shoulders: <i>Manque d'entente</i>. His casual\ntone made the best translation of this: We didn't get on very well. I\ncould not help observing that if men in general looked upon this as an\nadequate reason for murdering their wives, the mortality in the female\nsex would be alarming. But after putting a good many questions to a good\nmany men I arrived at the conclusion that at the bottom of nearly all\nthese crimes was an economic motive; they had killed their wives or\nmistresses not only from jealousy, because they were unfaithful to them,\nbut also because somehow it affected their pockets. A woman's infidelity\nwas sometimes an occasion of financial loss, and it was this in the end\nthat drove a man to his desperate act; or, himself in need of money to\ngratify other passions, he murdered because his victim was an obstacle\nto his exclusive possession of it. I do not conclude that a man never\nkills his woman because his love is spurned or his honour tarnished, I\nonly offer my observation on these particular cases as a curious\nsidelight on human nature. I should not venture to deduce from it a\ngeneral rule.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI spent another day inquiring into the matter of conscience. Moralists\nhave sought to persuade us that it is one of the most powerful agents in\nhuman behaviour. Now that reason and pity have agreed to regard\nhell-fire as a hateful myth, many good men have seen in conscience the\nchief safeguard that shall induce the human race to walk in the way of\nrighteousness. Shakespeare has told us that it makes cowards of us all.\nNovelists and playwrights have described for us the pangs that assail\nthe wicked; they have vividly pictured the anguish of a stricken\nconscience and the sleepless nights it occasions; they have shown it\npoisoning every pleasure till life is so intolerable that discovery and\npunishment come as a welcome relief. I had often wondered how much of\nall this was true. Moralists have an axe to grind; they must draw a\nmoral. They think that if they say a thing often enough people will\nbelieve it. They are apt to state that a thing is so when they consider\nit desirable that it should be. They tell us that the wages of sin is\ndeath; we know very well that it is not always. And so far as the\nauthors of fiction are concerned, the playwrights and the novelists,\nwhen they get hold of an effective theme they are disposed to make use\nof it without bothering very much whether it agrees with the facts of\nlife. Certain statements about human nature become, as it were, common\nproperty and so are accepted as self-evident. In the same way painters\nfor ages painted shadows black, and it was not till the impressionists\nlooked at them with unprejudiced eyes and painted what they saw that we\ndiscovered that shadows were coloured. It had sometimes struck me that\nperhaps conscience was the expression of a high moral development, so\nthat its influence was strong only in those whose virtue was so shining\nthat they were unlikely to commit any action for which they could\nseriously reproach themselves. It is generally accepted that murder is a\nshocking crime, and it is the murderer above all other criminals who is\nsupposed to suffer remorse. His victim, we have been led to believe,\nhaunts his dreams in horrifying nightmares, and the recollection of his\ndreadful deed tortures his waking hours. I could not miss the\nopportunity to enquire into the truth of this. I had no intention of\ninsisting if I encountered reticence or distress, but I found in none of\nthose with whom I talked any such thing. Some said that in the same\ncircumstances they would do as they had done before. Determinists\nwithout knowing it, they seemed to look upon their action as ordained by\na fate over which they had no control. Some appeared to think that their\ncrime was committed by someone with whom they had no connection.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When one's young, one's foolish,\" they said, with a careless gesture or\na deprecating smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOthers told me that if they had known what the punishment was they would\nsuffer, they would certainly have held their hands. I found in none any\nregret for the human being they had violently bereft of life. It seemed\nto me that they had no more feeling for the creature they had killed\nthan if it had been a pig whose throat they had cut in the way of\nbusiness. Far from feeling pity for their victim, they were more\ninclined to feel anger because he had been the occasion of their\nimprisonment in that distant land. In only one man did I discern\nanything that might appropriately be called a conscience, and his story\nwas so remarkable that I think it well worth narrating. For in this case\nit was, so far as I can understand, remorse that was the motive of the\ncrime. I noticed the man's number, which was printed on the chest of the\npink and white pyjamas of his prison uniform, but I have forgotten it.\nAnyhow it is of no consequence. I never knew his name. He did not offer\nto tell me and I did not like to ask it. I will call him Jean Charvin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI met him on my first visit to the camp with the commandant. We were\nwalking through a courtyard round which were cells, not punishment\ncells, but individual cells which are given to well-behaved prisoners\nwho ask for them. They are sought after by those to whom the promiscuity\nof the dormitories is odious. Most of them were empty, for their\noccupants were engaged in their various employments. Jean Charvin was at\nwork in his cell, writing at a small table, and the door was open. The\ncommandant called him and he came out. I looked into the cell. It\ncontained a fixed hammock, with a dingy mosquito-net; by the side of\nthis was a small table on which were his bits and pieces, a shaving-mop\nand a razor, a hairbrush and two or three battered books. On the walls\nwere photographs of persons of respectable appearance and illustrations\nfrom picture papers. He had been sitting on his bed to write and the\ntable on which he had been writing was covered with papers. They looked\nlike accounts. He was a handsome man, tall, erect and lean, with\nflashing dark eyes and clean-cut, strong features. The first thing I\nnoticed about him was that he had a fine head of long, naturally-waving\ndark brown hair. This at once made him look different from the rest of\nthe prisoners, whose hair is close-cropped, but cropped so badly, in\nridges, that it gives them a sinister look. The commandant spoke to him\nof some official business, and then as we were leaving added in a\nfriendly way:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I see your hair is growing well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJean Charvin reddened and smiled. His smile was boyish and engaging.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It'll be some time yet before I get it right again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe commandant dismissed him and we went on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's a very decent fellow,\" he said. \"He's in the accountant's\ndepartment, and he's had leave to let his hair grow. He's delighted.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is he here for?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He killed his wife. But he's only got six years. He's clever and a good\nworker. He'll do well. He comes from a very decent family and he's had\nan excellent education.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI thought no more of Jean Charvin, but by chance I met him next day on\nthe road. He was coming towards me. He carried a black dispatch-case\nunder his arm, and except for the pink and white stripes of his uniform\nand the ugly round straw hat that concealed his handsome head of hair,\nyou might have taken him for a young lawyer on his way to court. He\nwalked with a long, leisurely stride, and he had an easy, you might\nalmost say a gallant, bearing. He recognised me, and taking off his hat\nbade me good-morning. I stopped, and for something to say asked him\nwhere he was going. He told me he was taking some papers from the\ngovernor's office to the bank. There was a pleasing frankness in his\nface, and his eyes, his really beautiful eyes, shone with good will. I\nsupposed that the vigour of his youth was such that it made life,\nnotwithstanding his position and his surroundings, more than tolerable,\neven pleasant. You would have said that here was a young man without a\ncare in the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hear you're going to St. Jean to-morrow,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. It appears I must start at dawn.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSt. Jean is a camp seventeen kilometres from St. Laurent, and it is here\nthat are interned the habitual criminals who have been sentenced to\ntransportation after repeated terms of imprisonment. They are petty\nthieves, confidence men, forgers, tricksters and suchlike; the prisoners\nof St. Laurent, condemned for more serious offences, look upon them with\ncontempt.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You should find it an interesting experience,\" Jean Charvin said, with\nhis frank and engaging smile. \"But keep your pocket-book buttoned up,\nthey'd steal the shirt off your back if they had half a chance. They're\na dirty lot of scoundrels!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat afternoon, waiting till the heat of the day was less, I sat on the\nverandah outside my bedroom and read: I had drawn the jalousies and it\nwas tolerably cool. My old Arab came up the stairs on his bare feet, and\nin his halting French told me that there was a man from the commandant\nwho wanted to see me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Send him up,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn a moment the man came, and it was Jean Charvin. He told me that the\ncommandant had sent him to give me a message about my excursion next day\nto St. Jean. When he had delivered it I asked him if he would not sit\ndown and have a cigarette with me. He wore a cheap wrist-watch and he\nlooked at it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have a few minutes to spare. I should be glad to.\" He sat down and\nlit the cigarette I offered him. He gave me a smiling look of his soft\neyes. \"Do you know, this is the first time I've ever been asked to sit\ndown since I was sentenced.\" He inhaled a long whiff of his cigarette.\n\"Egyptian. I haven't smoked an Egyptian cigarette for three years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe convicts make their own cigarettes out of a coarse, strong tobacco\nthat is sold in square blue packets. Since one is not allowed to pay\nthem for the services they may render you, but may give them tobacco, I\nhad bought a good many packets of this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How does it taste?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One gets accustomed to everything and, to tell you the truth, my palate\nis so vitiated, I prefer the stuff we get here.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll give you a couple of packets.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI went into my room and fetched them. When I returned he was looking at\nsome books that were lying on the table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you fond of reading?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very. I think the want of books is what I most suffer from now. The few\nI can get hold of I'm forced to read over and over again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo so great a reader as myself no deprivation seems more insupportable\nthan the lack of books.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have several French ones in my bag. I'll look them out and if you\ncare to have them I'll give them to you if you can come along again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy offer was due only in part to kindness; I wanted to have another\nchance of a talk with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have to show them to the commandant. He would only let me keep\nthem if there was no doubt they couldn't possibly corrupt my morals. But\nhe's a good-natured man, I don't think he'll make any difficulties.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a hint of slyness in the smile with which he said this, and I\nsuspected that he had taken the measure of the well-meaning,\nconscientious chief of the camp and knew pretty well how to get on the\nright side of him. It would have been unjust to blame him if he\nexercised tact, and even cunning, to render his lot as tolerable as\nmight be.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The commandant has a very good opinion of you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's a fine man. I'm very grateful to him, he's done a great deal for\nme. I'm an accountant by profession and he's put me in the accountant's\ndepartment. I love figures, it gives me an intense satisfaction to deal\nwith them, they're living things to me, and now that I can handle them\nall day long I feel myself again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And are you glad to have a cell of your own?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's made all the difference. To be herded with fifty men, the scum of\nthe earth, and never to be alone for a minute--it was awful. That was\nthe worst of all. At home, at Le Havre, that is where I lived, I had an\napartment, modest of course, but my own, and we had a maid who came in\nby the day. We lived decently. It made it ten times harder for me than\nfor the rest, most of them, who have never known anything but squalor,\nfilth and promiscuity.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had asked him about the cell in the hope that I could get him to talk\nabout the life that is led in those vast dormitories in which the men\nare locked from five in the evening till five next morning. During these\ntwelve hours they are their own masters. A warder can enter, they told\nme, only at the risk of his life. They have no light after eight\no'clock, but from sardine-tins, a little oil, and a rag they make lamps\nby the light of which they can see enough to play cards. They gamble\nfuriously, not for love, but for the money they keep secreted on their\nbodies; they are unscrupulous ruthless men, and naturally enough bitter\nquarrels often arise. They are settled with knives. Often in the\nmorning, when the dormitory is opened, a man is found dead, but no\nthreats, no promises, will induce anyone to betray the slayer. Other\nthings Jean Charvin told me which I cannot narrate. He told me of one\nyoung fellow who had come out from France on the same ship with himself\nand with whom he had made friends. He was a good-looking boy. One day he\nwent to the commandant and asked him if he could have a cell to himself.\nThe commandant asked him why he wanted one. He explained. The commandant\nlooked through his list and told him that at the moment all were\noccupied, but that as soon as there was a vacancy he should have one.\nNext morning when the dormitory was opened, he was found dead on his\nhammock with his belly ripped open to the breast-bone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're savage brutes, and if one isn't a brute by the time one arrives\nonly a miracle can save one from becoming as brutal as the rest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJean Charvin looked at his watch and got up. He walked away from me and\nthen, with his charming smile, turned and faced me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must go now. If the commandant gives me permission I will come and\nget the books you were kind enough to offer me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn Guiana you do not shake hands with a convict, and a tactful man,\ntaking leave of you, puts himself in such a position that there can be\nno question of your offering him your hand or of refusing his should he,\nforgetting for a moment, instinctively tender it. Heaven knows, it would\nhave meant nothing to me to shake hands with Jean Charvin; it gave me a\npang to see the care he had taken to spare me embarrassment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI saw him twice more during my stay at St. Laurent. He told me his\nstory, but I will tell it now in my words rather than in his, for I had\nto piece it together from what he said at one time and another, and what\nhe left out I have had to supply out of my own imagination. I do not\nbelieve it has led me astray. It was as though he had given me three\nletters out of a number of five-letter words; the chances are that I\nhave guessed most of the words correctly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJean Charvin was born and bred in the great seaport of Le Havre. His\nfather had a good post in the Customs. Having finished his education, he\ndid his military service, and then looked about for a job. Like a great\nmany other young Frenchmen he was prepared to sacrifice the hazardous\nchance of wealth for a respectable security. His natural gift for\nfigures made it easy for him to get a place in the accountant's\ndepartment of a large exporting house. His future was assured. He could\nlook forward to earning a sufficient income to live in the modest\ncomfort of the class to which he belonged. He was industrious and\nwell-behaved. Like most young Frenchmen of his generation he was\nathletic. He swam and played tennis in summer, and in winter he\nbicycled. On two evenings a week to keep himself fit he spent a couple\nof hours in a gymnasium. Through his childhood, his adolescence and his\nyoung manhood, he lived in the constant companionship of a boy called,\nshall we say for the purposes of this narrative, Henri Renard, whose\nfather was also an official in the Customs. Jean and Riri went to school\ntogether, played together, worked for their examinations together, spent\ntheir holidays together, for the two families were intimate, had their\nfirst affairs with girls together, partnered one another in the local\ntennis tournaments, and did their military service together. They never\nquarrelled. They were never so happy as in one another's society. They\nwere inseparable. When the time came for them to start working they\ndecided that they would go into the same firm; but that was not so easy;\nJean tried to get Riri a job in the exporting house that had engaged\nhim, but could not manage it, and it was not till a year later that Riri\ngot something to do. But by then trade was as bad at Le Havre as\neverywhere else, and in a few months he found himself once more without\nemployment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRiri was a light-hearted youth, and he enjoyed his leisure. He danced,\nbathed and played tennis. It was thus that he made the acquaintance of a\ngirl who had recently come to live at Le Havre. Her father had been a\ncaptain in the colonial army and on his death her mother had returned to\nLe Havre, which was her native place. Marie-Louise was then eighteen.\nShe had spent almost all her life in Tonkin. This gave her an exotic\nattraction for the young men who had never been out of France in their\nlives, and first Riri, then Jean, fell in love with her. Perhaps that\nwas inevitable; it was certainly unfortunate. She was a well-brought-up\ngirl, an only child, and her mother, besides her pension, had a little\nmoney of her own. It was evident that she could be pursued only with a\nview to marriage. Of course Riri, dependent for the while entirely on\nhis father, could not make an offer that there was the least chance of\nMadame Meurice, Marie-Louise's mother, accepting; but having the whole\nday to himself he was able to see a great deal more of Marie-Louise than\nJean could. Madame Meurice was something of an invalid, so that\nMarie-Louise had more liberty than most French girls of her age and\nstation. She knew that both Riri and Jean were in love with her, she\nliked them both and was pleased by their attentions, but she gave no\nsign that she was in love with either. It was impossible to tell which\nshe preferred. She was well aware that Riri was not in a position to\nmarry her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did she look like?\" I asked Jean Charvin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was small, with a pretty little figure, with large grey eyes, a\npale skin and soft, mouse-coloured hair. She was rather like a little\nmouse. She was not beautiful, but pretty, in a quaint demure way; there\nwas something very appealing about her. She was easy to get on with. She\nwas simple and unaffected. You couldn't help feeling that she was\nreliable and would make anyone a good wife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJean and Riri hid nothing from one another and Jean made no secret of\nthe fact that he was in love with Marie-Louise, but Riri had met her\nfirst and it was an understood thing between them that Jean should not\nstand in his way. At length she made her choice. One day Riri waited for\nJean to come away from his office and told him that Marie-Louise had\nconsented to marry him. They had arranged that as soon as he got a job\nhis father should go to her mother and make the formal offer. Jean was\nhard hit. It was not easy to listen with eager sympathy to the plans\nthat the excitable and enchanted Riri made for the future. But he was\ntoo much attached to Riri to feel sore with him; he knew how lovable he\nwas and he could not blame Marie-Louise. He tried with all his might to\naccept honestly the sacrifice he made on the altar of friendship.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why did she choose him rather than you?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He had immense vitality. He was the gayest, most amusing lad you ever\nmet. His high spirits were infectious. You couldn't be dull in his\ncompany.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He had pep,\" I smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And an incredible charm.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Was he good-looking?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, not very. He was shorter than me, slight and wiry; but he had a\nnice, good-humoured face.\" Jean Charvin smiled rather pleasantly. \"I\nthink without any vanity I can say that I was better-looking than Riri.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut Riri did not get a job. His father, tired of keeping him in\nidleness, wrote to everyone he could think of, the members of his family\nand his friends in various parts of France, asking them if they could\nnot find something, however modest, for Riri to do; and at last he got a\nletter from a cousin in Lyons who was in the silk business to say that\nhis firm were looking for a young man to go out to Phnom-Penh, in\nCambodia, where they had a branch, to buy native silk for them. If Riri\nwas willing to take the job he could get it for him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThough like all French parents Riri's hated him to emigrate, there\nseemed no help for it, and it was determined, although the salary was\nsmall, that he must go. He was not disinclined. Cambodia was not so far\nfrom Tonkin, and Marie-Louise must be familiar with the life. She had so\noften talked of it that he had come to the conclusion that she would be\nglad to go back to the East. To his dismay she told him that nothing\nwould induce her to. In the first place she could not desert her mother,\nwhose health was obviously declining; and then, after having at last\nsettled down in France, she was determined never again to leave it. She\nwas sympathetic to Riri, but resolute. With nothing else in prospect his\nfather would not hear of his refusing the offer; there was no help for\nit, he had to go. Jean hated losing him, but from the moment Riri told\nhim his bad news, he had realised with an exulting heart that fate was\nplaying into his hands. With Riri out of his way for five years at\nleast, and unless he were incompetent with the probability that he would\nsettle in the East for good, Jean could not doubt that after a while\nMarie-Louise would marry him. His circumstances, his settled,\nrespectable position in Le Havre, where she could be near her mother,\nwould make her think it very sensible; and when she was no longer under\nthe spell of Riri's charm there was no reason why her great liking for\nhim should not turn to love. Life changed for him. After months of\nmisery he was happy again, and though he kept them to himself he too now\nmade great plans for the future. There was no need any longer to try not\nto love Marie-Louise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSuddenly his hopes were shattered. One of the shipping firms at Le Havre\nhad a vacancy, and it looked as though the application that Riri had\nquickly made would be favourably considered. A friend in the office told\nhim that it was a certainty. It would settle everything. It was an old\nand conservative house, and it was well known that when you once got\ninto it you were there for life. Jean Charvin was in despair, and the\nworst of it was that he had to keep his anguish to himself. One day the\ndirector of his own firm sent for him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen he reached this point Jean stopped. A harassed look came into his\neyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going to tell you something now that I've never told to anyone\nbefore. I'm an honest man, a man of principle; I'm going to tell you of\nthe only discreditable action I've ever done in my life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI must remind the reader here that Jean Charvin was wearing the pink and\nwhite stripes of the convict's uniform, with his number stencilled on\nhis chest, and that he was serving a term of imprisonment for the murder\nof his wife.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I couldn't imagine what the director wanted with me. He was sitting at\nhis desk when I went into his office, and he gave me a searching look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I want to ask you a question of great importance,' he said. 'I wish\nyou to treat it as confidential. I shall of course treat your answer as\nequally so.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I waited. He went on:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You've been with us for a considerable time. I am very well satisfied\nwith you, there is no reason why you shouldn't reach a very good\nposition in the firm. I put implicit confidence in you.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Thank you, sir,' I said. 'I will always try to merit your good\nopinion.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'The question at issue is this. Monsieur Untel is proposing to engage\nHenri Renard. He is very particular about the character of his\nemployees, and in this case it is essential that he shouldn't make a\nmistake. Part of Henri Renard's duties would be to pay the crews of the\nfirm's ships, and many hundreds of thousand francs will pass through his\nhands. I know that Henri Renard is your great friend and that your\nfamilies have always been very intimate. I put you on your honour to\ntell me whether Monsieur Untel would be justified in engaging this young\nman.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I saw at once what the question meant. If Riri got the job he would\nstay and marry Marie-Louise, if he didn't he would go out to Cambodia\nand I should marry her. I swear to you it was not I who answered, it was\nsomeone who stood in my shoes and spoke with my voice, I had nothing to\ndo with the words that came from my mouth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'<i>Monsieur le directeur</i>,' I said, 'Henri and I have been friends all\nour lives. We have never been separated for a week. We went to school\ntogether; we shared our pocket-money and our mistresses when we were old\nenough to have them; we did our military service together.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I know. You know him better than anyone in the world. That is why I\nask you these questions.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It is not fair, <i>Monsieur le directeur</i>. You are asking me to betray\nmy friend. I cannot, and I will not answer your questions.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The director gave me a shrewd smile. He thought himself much cleverer\nthan he really was.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Your answer does you credit, but it has told me all I wished to know.'\nThen he smiled kindly. I suppose I was pale, I dare say I was trembling\na little. 'Pull yourself together, my dear boy; you're upset and I can\nunderstand it. Sometimes in life one is faced by a situation where\nhonesty stands on the one side and loyalty on the other. Of course one\nmustn't hesitate, but the choice is bitter. I shall not forget your\nbehaviour in this case and on behalf of Monsieur Untel I thank you.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I withdrew. Next morning Riri received a letter informing him that his\nservices were not required, and a month later he sailed for the far\nEast.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSix months after this Jean Charvin and Marie-Louise were married. The\nmarriage was hastened by the increasing gravity of Madame Meurice's\nillness. Knowing that she could not live long, she was anxious to see\nher daughter settled before she died. Jean wrote to Riri telling him the\nfacts and Riri wrote back warmly congratulating him. He assured him that\nhe need have no compunctions on his behalf; when he had left France he\nrealised that he could never marry Marie-Louise, and he was glad that\nJean was going to. He was finding consolation at Phnom-Penh. His letter\nwas very cheerful. From the beginning Jean had told himself that Riri,\nwith his mercurial temperament, would soon forget Marie-Louise, and his\nletter looked as if he had already done so. He had done him no\nirreparable injury. It was a justification. For if he had lost\nMarie-Louise he would have died; with him it was a matter of life and\ndeath.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a year Jean and Marie-Louise were extremely happy. Madame Meurice\ndied, and Marie-Louise inherited a couple of hundred thousand francs;\nbut with the depression and the unstable currency they decided not to\nhave a child till the economic situation was less uncertain.\nMarie-Louise was a good and frugal housekeeper. She was an affectionate,\namiable and satisfactory wife. She was placid. This before he married\nher had seemed to Jean a rather charming trait, but as time wore on it\nwas borne in upon him that her placidity came from a certain lack of\nemotional ardour. It concealed no depth. He had always thought she was\nlike a little mouse; there was something mouse-like in her furtive\nreticences; she was oddly serious about trivial matters and could busy\nherself indefinitely with things that were of no consequence. She had\nher own tiny little set of interests and they left no room in her pretty\nsleek head for any others. She sometimes began a novel, but seldom cared\nto finish it. Jean was obliged to admit to himself that she was rather\ndull. The uneasy thought came to him that perhaps it had not been worth\nwhile to do a dirty trick for her sake. It began to worry him. He missed\nRiri. He tried to persuade himself that what was done was done and that\nhe had really not been a free agent, but he could not quite still the\nprickings of his conscience. He wished now that when the director of his\nfirm spoke to him he had answered differently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen a terrible thing happened. Riri contracted typhoid fever and died.\nIt was a frightful shock for Jean. It was a shock to Marie-Louise too;\nshe paid Riri's parents the proper visit of condolence, but she neither\nate less heartily nor slept less soundly. Jean was exasperated by her\ncomposure.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor chap, he was always so gay,\" she said, \"he must have hated dying.\nBut why did he go out there? I told him the climate was bad; it killed\nmy father and I knew what I was talking about.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJean felt that he had killed him. If he had told the director all the\ngood he knew of Riri, knew as no one else in the world did, he would\nhave got the post and would now be alive and well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall never forgive myself,\" he thought. \"I shall never be happy\nagain. Oh, what a fool I was, and what a cad!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe wept for Riri. Marie-Louise sought to comfort him. She was a kind\nlittle thing and she loved him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You mustn't take it too hardly. After all, you wouldn't have seen him\nfor five years, and you'd have found him so changed that there wouldn't\nhave been anything between you any more. He would have been a stranger\nto you. I've seen that sort of thing happen so often. You'd have been\ndelighted to see him, and in half an hour you'd have discovered that you\nhad nothing to say to one another.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say you're right,\" he sighed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was too scatter-brained ever to have amounted to anything very much.\nHe never had your firmness of character and your clear, solid\nintellect.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe knew what she was thinking. What would have been her position now if\nshe had followed Riri to Indo-China and found herself at twenty-one a\nwidow with nothing but her own two hundred thousand francs to live on?\nIt was a lucky escape and she congratulated herself on her good sense.\nJean was a husband of whom she could be proud. He was earning good\nmoney. Jean was tortured by remorse. What he had suffered before was\nnothing to what he suffered now. The anguish that the recollection of\nhis treachery caused him was worse than a physical pain gnawing at his\nvitals. It would assail him suddenly when he was in the middle of his\nwork and twist his heartstrings with a violent pang. His agony was such\nthat he craved for relief, and it was only by an effort of all his will\nthat he prevented himself from making a full confession to Marie-Louise.\nBut he knew how she would take it; she would not be shocked, she would\nthink it rather a clever trick and be even subtly flattered that for her\nsake he had been guilty of a despicable act. She could not help him. He\nbegan to dislike her. For it was for her that he had done the shameful\nthing, and what was she? An ordinary, commonplace, rather calculating\nlittle woman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a fool I've been,\" he repeated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not even find her pretty any more. He knew now that she was\nterribly stupid. But of course she was not to blame for that, she was\nnot to blame because he had been false to his friend; and he forced\nhimself to be as sweet and tender to her as he had always been. He did\nwhatever she wanted. She had only to express a wish for him to fulfil it\nif it was in his power. He tried to pity her, he tried to be tolerant;\nhe told himself that from her own petty standpoint she was a good wife,\nmethodical, saving, and in her manner, dress and appearance a credit to\na respectable young man. All that was true; but it was on her account\nthat Riri had died, and he loathed her. She bored him to distraction.\nThough he said nothing, though he was kind, amiable and indulgent, he\ncould often have killed her. When he did, however, it was almost without\nmeaning to. It was ten months after Riri's death, and Riri's parents,\nMonsieur and Madame Renard, gave a party to celebrate the engagement of\ntheir daughter. Jean had seen little of them since Riri's death and he\ndid not want to go. But Marie-Louise said they must; he had been Riri's\ngreatest friend and it would be a grave lack of politeness on Jean's\npart not to attend an important celebration in the family. She had a\nkeen sense of social obligation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Besides, it'll be a distraction for you. You've been in poor spirits\nfor so long, a little amusement will do you good. There'll be champagne,\nwon't there? Madame Renard doesn't like spending money, but on an\noccasion like this she'll have to sacrifice herself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMarie-Louise chuckled slyly when she thought what a wrench it would be\nto Madame Renard to unloose her purse-strings.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe party had been very gay. It gave Jean a nasty turn when he found\nthat they were using Riri's old room for the women to put their wraps in\nand the men their coats. There was plenty of champagne. Jean drank a\ngreat deal to drown the bitter remorse that tormented him. He wanted to\ndeaden the sound in his ears of Riri's laugh and to shut his eyes to the\ngood-humour of his shining glance. It was three o'clock when they got\nhome. Next day was Sunday, so Jean had no work to go to. They slept\nlate. The rest I can tell in Jean Charvin's own words.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I had a headache when I woke. Marie-Louise was not in bed. She was\nsitting at the dressing-table brushing her hair. I've always been very\nkeen on physical culture, and I was in the habit of doing exercises\nevery morning. I didn't feel very much inclined to do them that morning,\nbut after all that champagne I thought I'd better. I got out of bed and\ntook up my Indian clubs. Our bedroom was fairly large and there was\nplenty of room to swing them between the bed and the dressing-table\nwhere Marie-Louise was sitting. I did my usual exercises. Marie-Louise\nhad started a little while before having her hair cut differently, quite\nshort, and I thought it repulsive. From the back she looked like a boy,\nand the stubble of cropped hair on her neck made me feel rather sick.\nShe put down her brushes and began to powder her face. She gave a nasty\nlittle laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What are you laughing at?' I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Madame Renard. That was the same dress she wore at our wedding, she'd\nhad it dyed and done over; but it didn't deceive me. I'd have known it\nanywhere.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was such a stupid remark, it infuriated me. I was seized with rage,\nand with all my might I hit her over the head with my Indian club. I\nbroke her skull, apparently, and she died two days later in hospital\nwithout recovering consciousness.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe paused for a moment. I handed him a cigarette and lit another myself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was glad she did. We could never have lived together again, and it\nwould have been very hard to explain my action.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was arrested and tried for murder. Of course I swore it was an\naccident, I said the club had slipped out of my hand, but the medical\nevidence was against me. The prosecution proved that such an injury as\nMarie-Louise had suffered could only have been caused by a violent and\ndeliberate blow. Fortunately for me they could find no motive. The\npublic prosecutor tried to make out that I had been jealous of the\nattentions some man had paid her at the party and that we had quarrelled\non that account, but the man he mentioned swore that he had done nothing\nto arouse my suspicions and others at the party testified that we had\nleft the best of friends. They found on the dressing-table an unpaid\ndressmaker's bill and the prosecutor suggested that we had quarrelled\nabout that, but I was able to prove that Marie-Louise paid for her\nclothes out of her own money, so that the bill could not possibly have\nbeen the cause of a dispute. Witnesses came forward and said that I had\nalways been kind to Marie-Louise. We were generally looked upon as a\ndevoted couple. My character was excellent and my employer spoke in the\nhighest terms of me. I was never in danger of losing my head, and at one\nmoment I thought I had a chance of getting off altogether. In the end I\nwas sentenced to six years. I don't regret what I did, for from that\nday, all the time I was in prison awaiting my trial, and since, while\nI've been here, I've ceased to worry about Riri. If I believed in ghosts\nI'd be inclined to say that Marie-Louise's death has laid Riri's.\nAnyhow, my conscience is at rest, and after all the torture I suffered I\ncan assure you that everything I've gone through since is worth it; I\nfeel I can now look the world in the face again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI know that this is a fantastic story; I am by way of being a realist,\nand in the stories I write I seek verisimilitude. I eschew the bizarre\nas scrupulously as I avoid the whimsical. If this had been a tale that I\nwas inventing I would certainly have made it more probable. As it is,\nunless I had heard it with my own ears I am not sure that I should\nbelieve it. I do not know whether Jean Charvin told me the truth, and\nyet the words with which he closed his final visit to me had a\nconvincing ring. I had asked him what were his plans for the future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have friends working for me in France,\" he answered. \"A great many\npeople thought at the time that I was the victim of a grave miscarriage\nof justice; the director of my firm is convinced that I was unjustly\ncondemned; and I may get a reduction of my sentence. Even if I don't, I\nthink I can count upon getting back to France at the end of my six\nyears. You see, I'm making myself very useful here. The accounts were\nvery badly kept when I took them over, and I've got them in apple-pie\norder. There have been leakages, and I am convinced that if they'll give\nme a free hand, I can stop them. The commandant likes me and I'm certain\nthat he'll do everything he can for me. At the worst I shan't be much\nover thirty when I get back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But won't you find it rather difficult to get work?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A clever accountant like me, and a man who's honest and industrious,\ncan always get work. Of course I shan't be able to live in Le Havre, but\nthe director of my firm has business connections at Lille and Lyons and\nMarseilles. He's promised to do something for me. No, I look forward to\nthe years to come with a good deal of confidence. I shall settle down\nsomewhere, and as soon as I'm comfortably fixed up I shall marry. After\nwhat I've been through I want a home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe were sitting in one of the corners of the verandah that surrounded my\nhouse in order to get any draught there might be, and on the north side\nI had left a jalousie undrawn. The strip of sky you saw with a single\ncoconut tree on one side, its green foliage harsh against the blue,\nlooked like an advertisement for a tropical cruise. Jean Charvin's eyes\nsearched the distance as though he sought to see the future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But next time I marry,\" he said thoughtfully, \"I shan't marry for love,\nI shall marry for money.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nHe was a sturdy broad-shouldered fellow, of the middle height; though\nhis bones were well covered as became his age, which was fifty, he was\nnot fat; he had a ruddy complexion which neither the heat of the sun nor\nthe unwholesomeness of the climate had affected. It was good rich blood\nthat ran through his veins. His hair was brown and thick, and only at\nthe temples touched with grey; he was very proud of his fair, handsome\nmoustache and he kept it carefully brushed. There was a pleasant twinkle\nin his blue eyes. You would have said that this was a man whom life had\ntreated well. There was in his appearance an air of good nature and in\nhis vigour a glow of health that gave you confidence. He reminded you of\none of those well-fed, rubicund burghers in an old Dutch picture, with\ntheir pink-cheeked wives, who made money and enjoyed the good things\nwith which their industry provided them. He was, however, a widower. His\nname was Louis Remire, and his number 68763. He was serving a\ntwelve-year sentence at St. Laurent de Maroni, the great penal\nsettlement of French Guiana, for killing his wife, but partly because he\nhad served in the police force at Lyons, his native town, and partly on\naccount of his good character, he had been given an official position.\nHe had been chosen among nearly two hundred applicants to be the public\nexecutioner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat was why he was allowed to sport the handsome moustache of which he\ntook so much care. He was the only convict who wore one. It was in a\nmanner of speaking his badge of office. That also was why he was allowed\nto wear his own clothes. The convicts wear pyjamas in pink and white\nstripes, round straw hats and clumsy boots with wooden soles and leather\ntops. Louis Remire wore espadrilles on his bare feet, blue cotton\ntrousers, and a khaki shirt the open neck of which exposed to view his\nhairy and virile chest. When you saw him strolling about the public\ngarden, with a kindly eye looking at the children, black or half-caste,\nwho played there, you would have taken him for a respectable shopkeeper\nwho was enjoying an hour's leisure. He had his own house. That was not\nonly one of the perquisites of his office, but it was a necessity, since\nif he had lodged in the prison camp the convicts would have made short\nwork of him. One morning he would have been found with his belly ripped\nopen. It was true that the house was small, it was just a wooden shack\nof one room, with a lean-to that served as a kitchen; but it was\nsurrounded by a tiny garden, within a palisade, and in the garden grew\nbananas, papaias and such vegetables as the climate allowed him to\nraise. The garden faced the sea and was surrounded by a coconut grove.\nThe situation was charming. It was only a quarter of a mile from the\nprison, which was convenient for his rations. They were fetched by his\nassistant, who lived with him. The assistant, a tall, gawky, ungainly\nfellow, with deep-set, staring eyes and cavernous jaws, was serving a\nlife sentence for rape and murder; he was not very intelligent, but in\ncivil life he had been a cook and it was wonderful what, with the help\nof the vegetables they grew and such condiments as Louis Remire could\nafford to buy at the Chinese grocer's, he managed to do with the soup,\npotatoes and cabbage, and eternal beef, beef for three hundred and\nsixty-five days of the year, which the prison kitchens provided. It was\non this account that Louis Remire had pressed his claim on the\ncommandant when it had been found necessary to get a new assistant. The\nlast one's nerves had given way and, absurdly enough, thought Louis\nRemire with a good-natured laugh, he had developed scruples about\ncapital punishment; now, suffering from neurasthenia, he was on the Ile\nSt. Joseph, where the insane were confined.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis present assistant happened to be ill. He had high fever, and looked\nvery much as if he were going to die. It had been necessary to send him\nto hospital. Louis Remire was sorry; he would not easily find so good a\ncook again. It was bad luck that this should have happened just now, for\nnext day there was a job of work to be done. Six men were to be\nexecuted. Two were Algerians, one was a Pole, another a Spaniard from\nthe mainland, and only two were French. They had escaped from prison in\na band and gone up the river. For nearly twelve months, stealing, raping\nand killing they had spread terror through the colony. People scarcely\ndared move from their homesteads. Recaptured at last, they had all been\nsentenced to death, but the sentence had to be confirmed by the Minister\nof the Colonies, and the confirmation had only just arrived. Louis\nRemire could not manage without help, and besides there was a lot to\narrange beforehand; it was particularly unfortunate that on this\noccasion of all others he should have to depend on an inexperienced man.\nThe commandant had assigned to him one of the turnkeys. The turnkeys are\nconvicts like the others, but they have been given their places for good\nbehaviour and they live in separate quarters. They are on the side of\nthe authorities and so are disliked by the other prisoners. Louis Remire\nwas a conscientious fellow, and he was anxious that everything next day\nshould go without a hitch. He arranged that his temporary assistant\nshould come that afternoon to the place where the guillotine was kept so\nthat he might explain to him thoroughly how it worked and show him\nexactly what he would have to do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe guillotine, when not in use, stood in a small room which was part of\nthe prison building, but which was entered by a separate door from the\noutside. When he sauntered along there at the appointed hour he found\nthe man already waiting. He was a large-limbed, coarse-faced fellow. He\nwas dressed in the pink and white stripes of the prison garb, but as\nturnkey he wore a felt hat instead of the straw of common convicts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you here for?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe man shrugged his shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I killed a farmer and his wife.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"H'm. How long have you got?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked a brute, but you could never be sure of people. He had himself\nseen a warder, a big, powerful man, faint dead away at an execution. He\ndid not want his assistant to have an attack of nerves at the wrong\nmoment. He gave him a friendly smile, and with his thumb pointed to the\nclosed door behind which stood the guillotine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is another sort of job,\" he said. \"There are six of them, you\nknow. They're a bad lot. The sooner they're out of the way the better.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, that's all right. After what I've seen in this place I'm scared of\nnothing. It means no more to me than cutting the head off a chicken.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLouis Remire unlocked the door and walked in. His assistant followed\nhim. The guillotine in that small room, hardly larger than a cell,\nseemed to take up a great deal of space. It stood grim and sinister.\nLouis Remire heard a slight gasp and turning round saw that the turnkey\nwas staring at the instrument with terrified eyes. His face was sallow\nand drawn from the fever and the hookworm from which all the convicts\nintermittently suffered, but now its pallor was ghastly. The executioner\nsmiled good-naturedly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Gives you a turn, does it? Have you never seen it before?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLouis Remire gave a little throaty chuckle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you had, I suppose you wouldn't have survived to tell the tale. How\ndid you escape it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was starving when I did my job. I'd asked for something to eat and\nthey set the dogs on me. I was condemned to death. My lawyer went to\nParis and he got the President to reprieve me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's better to be alive than dead, there's no denying that,\" said Louis\nRemire, with that agreeable twinkle in his eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe always kept his guillotine in perfect order. The wood, a dark hard\nnative wood somewhat like mahogany, was highly polished; but there was a\ncertain amount of brass, and it was Louis Remire's pride that this\nshould be as bright and clean as the brass-work on a yacht. The knife\nshone as though it had just come out of the workshop. It was necessary\nnot only to see that everything functioned properly, but to show his\nassistant how it functioned. It was part of the assistant's duty to\nrefix the rope when the knife had dropped, and to do this he had to\nclimb a short ladder.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was with the satisfaction of a competent workman who knows his job\nfrom A to Z that Remire entered upon the necessary explanations. It gave\nhim a certain quiet pleasure to point out the ingenuity of the\napparatus. The condemned man was strapped to the bascule, a sort of\nshelf, and this by a simple mechanism was precipitated down and forwards\nso that the man's neck was conveniently under the knife. The\nconscientious fellow had brought with him a banana stem, about five feet\nlong, and the turnkey had wondered why. He was now to learn. The stem\nwas of about the same circumference and consistency as the human neck,\nso that it afforded a very good way, not only of showing a novice how\nthe apparatus worked, but of making sure beforehand that it was in\nperfect order. Louis Remire placed the banana stem in position. He\nreleased the knife. It fell with incredible speed and with a great bang.\nFrom the time the man was attached to the bascule to the time his head\nwas off only thirty seconds elapsed. The head fell in the basket. The\nexecutioner took it up by the ears and exhibited it to those whose duty\nit was to watch the execution. He uttered the solemn words:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Au nom du peuple français justice est faite.</i> In the name of the\nFrench people justice is done.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he dropped the head back into the basket. To-morrow, with six to be\ndispatched, the trunk would have to be unstrapped from the bascule and\nplaced with the head on a stretcher, and the next man brought forward.\nThey were taken in the order of their guilt. The least guilty, executed\nfirst, were spared the horror of seeing the death of their mates.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We shall have to be careful that the right head goes with the right\nbody,\" said Louis Remire, in that rather jovial manner of his, \"or there\nmay be no end of confusion at the Resurrection.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe let down the knife two or three times in order to make quite sure\nthat the assistant understood how to fix it, and then getting his\ncleaning-materials from the shelf on which he kept them set him to work\non the brass. Though it was spotless he thought that a final polish\nwould do no harm. He leaned against the wall and idly smoked cigarettes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFinally everything was in order and Louis Remire dismissed the assistant\ntill midnight. At midnight they were moving the guillotine from the room\nin which it stood to the prison yard. It was always a bit of a job to\nset it up again, but it had to be in place an hour before dawn, at which\ntime the execution took place. Louis Remire strolled slowly home to his\nshack. The afternoon was drawing to its close, and as he walked along he\npassed a working party who were returning to the prison. They spoke to\none another in undertones and he guessed that they spoke of him; some\nlooked down, two or three threw him a glance of hatred and one spat on\nthe ground. Louis Remire, the end of a cigarette sticking to his lip,\nlooked at them with irony. He was indifferent to the loathing, mingled\nwith fear, with which they regarded him. It did not matter to him that\nnot one of them would speak to him, and it only amused him to think that\nthere was hardly one who would not gladly have thrust a knife into his\nguts. He had a supreme contempt for them all. He could take care of\nhimself. He could use a knife as well as any of them, and he had\nconfidence in his strength. The convicts knew that men were to be\nexecuted next day, and as always before an execution they were depressed\nand nervous. They went about their work in sullen silence, and the\nwarders had to be more than usually on the alert.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They'll settle down when it's all over,\" said Louis Remire as he let\nhimself into his little compound.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe dogs barked as he came along, and brave though he was, he listened\nto their uproar with satisfaction. With his own assistant ill, so that\nhe was alone in the house, he was not sorry that he had the protection\nof those two savage mongrels. They prowled about the coconut grove\noutside his compound all night and they would give him good warning if\nanyone lurked there. They could be relied on to spring at the throat of\nany stranger who ventured too near. If his predecessor had had these\ndogs he wouldn't have come to his end.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe man who had been executioner before Louis Remire had only held the\njob a couple of years when one day he disappeared. The authorities\nthought he had run away; he was known to have a bit of money, and it was\nvery probable that he had managed to make arrangements with the captain\nof a schooner to take him to Brazil. His nerves had given way. He had\ngone two or three times to the governor of the prison and told him that\nhe feared for his life. He was convinced that the convicts were out to\nkill him. The governor felt pretty sure that his fears were groundless\nand paid no attention, but when the man was nowhere to be found he\nconcluded that his terror had got the better of him and he had preferred\nto run the danger of escape, and the danger of being recaptured and put\nback into prison, rather than face the risk of an avenging convict's\nknife. About three weeks later the warder in charge of a working party\nin the jungle noticed a great flock of vultures clustered round a tree.\nThese vultures, called urubus, are large black birds, of a horrible\naspect, and they fly about the market-place of St. Laurent, picking up\nthe offal that is left there by the starving liberated convicts, and\nflit heavily from tree to tree in the neat, well-kept streets of the\ntown. They fly in the prison yard to remind the convicts that if they\nattempt an escape into the jungle their end, ten to one, will be to have\ntheir bones picked clean by these loathsome creatures. They were\nfighting and screaming in such a mass round the tree that the warder\nthought there was something strange there. He reported it and the\ncommandant sent a party to see. They found a man hanging by the neck\nfrom one of the branches, and when they cut him down discovered that he\nwas the executioner. It was given out that he had committed suicide, but\nthere was a knife-thrust in his back, and the convicts knew that he had\nbeen stabbed and then, still alive, taken to the jungle and hanged.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLouis Remire had no fear that anything of that sort would happen to him.\nHe knew how his predecessor had been caught. The job had not been done\nby the convicts. By the French law when a man is sentenced to hard\nlabour for a certain number of years he has at the expiration of his\nsentence to remain in the colony for the same number of years. He is\nfree, but he may not stir from the spot that is assigned to him as a\nresidence. In certain circumstances he can get a concession and if he\nworks hard he manages to scrape a bare living from it, but after a long\nterm of penal servitude, during which he has lost all power of\ninitiative, what with the debilitating effect of fever, hookworm and so\non, he is unfit for heavy and continuous labour, and so most of the\nliberated men subsist on begging, larceny, smuggling tobacco or money to\nthe prisoners, and loading and unloading cargoes when two or three times\na month a steamer comes into the harbour. It was the wife of one of\nthese freed men that had been the means of the undoing of Louis Remire's\npredecessor. She was a coloured woman, young and pretty, with a neat\nlittle figure and mischievous eyes. The plot was well-considered. The\nexecutioner was a burly, sanguine man, of ardent passions. She had\nthrown herself in his way, and when she caught his approving glance, had\ncast him a saucy look. He saw her a day or two later in the public\ngarden. He did not venture to speak to her (no one, man, woman or child,\nwould be seen speaking to him), but when he winked at her she smiled.\nOne evening he met her walking through the coconut grove that surrounded\nhis compound. No one was about. He got into conversation with her. They\nonly exchanged a few words, for she was evidently terrified of being\nseen with him. But she came again to the coconut grove. She played him\ncarefully till his suspicions were allayed; she teased his desires; she\nmade him give her little presents, and at last on the promise of what\nwas for both of them quite a sum of money she agreed to come one dark\nnight to the compound. A ship had just come in and her husband would be\nworking till dawn. It was when he opened the door for her and she\nhesitated to come in as though at the last moment she could not make up\nher mind, that he stepped outside to draw her in, and fell to the ground\nwith the violence of the knife-thrust in his back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The fool,\" muttered Louis Remire. \"He only got what he deserved. He\nshould have smelt a rat. The eternal vanity of man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor his part he was through with women. It was on account of women that\nhe found himself in the situation he was in now, at least on account of\none woman; and besides, at his time of life, his passions were assuaged.\nThere were other things in life and after a certain age a man, if he was\nsensible, turned his attention to them. He had always been a great\nfisherman. In the old days, at home in France before he had had his\nmisfortune, as soon as he came off duty, he took his rod and line and\nwent down to the Rhone. He got a lot of fishing now. Every morning, till\nthe sun grew hot, he sat on his favourite rock and generally managed to\nget enough for the prison governor's table. The governor's wife knew the\nvalue of things and beat him down on the price he asked, but he did not\nblame her for that; she knew that he had to take what she was prepared\nto give and it would have been stupid of her to pay a penny more than\nshe had to. In any case it brought in a little money useful for tobacco\nand rum and other odds and ends. But this evening he was going to fish\nfor himself. He got his bait from the lean-to, and his rod, and settled\ndown on his rock. No fish was so good as the fish you caught yourself,\nand by now he knew which were those that were good to eat and which were\nso tough and flavourless that you could only throw them back into the\nsea. There was one sort that, fried in real olive oil, was as good as\nmullet. He had not been sitting there five minutes when his float gave a\nsudden jerk, and when he pulled up his line, there, like an answer to\nprayer, was one of those very fish wriggling on the hook. He took it\noff, banged its head on the rock, and putting it down, replaced his\nbait. Four of them would make a good supper, the best a man could have,\nand with a night's hard work before him he needed a hearty meal. He\nwould not have time to fish to-morrow morning. First of all the scaffold\nwould have to be taken down and the pieces brought back to the room in\nwhich it was kept, and there would be a lot of cleaning to do. It was a\nbloody business; last time he had had his pants so soaked that he had\nbeen able to do nothing with them and had had to throw them away. The\nbrass would have to be polished, the knife would have to be honed. He\nwas not a man to leave a job half finished, and by the time it was\nthrough he would be pretty peckish. It would be worth while to catch a\nfew more fish and put them in a cool place so that he could have a\nsubstantial breakfast. A cup of coffee, a couple of eggs and a bit of\nfried fish; he could do with that. Then he would have a good sleep;\nafter a night on his feet, the anxiety of an inexperienced assistant,\nand the clearing away of all the mess, God knew he would deserve it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn front of him was spread the bay in a noble sweep, and in the distance\nwas a little island green with trees. The afternoon was exquisitely\nstill. Peace descended on the fisherman's soul. He watched his float\nidly. When you came to think of it, he reflected, he might be a great\ndeal worse off; some of them, the convicts he meant, the convicts who\nswarmed in the prison a few hundred yards away from him, some of them\nhad such a nostalgia for France that they went mad with melancholy; but\nhe was a bit of a philosopher, so long as he could fish he was content;\nand did it really matter if he watched his float on the southern sea or\nin the Rhone? His thoughts wandered back to the past. His wife was an\nintolerable woman and he did not regret that he had killed her. He had\nnever meant to marry her. She was a dressmaker, and he had taken a fancy\nto her because she was always neatly and smartly dressed. She seemed\nrespectable and ladylike. He would not have been surprised if she had\nlooked upon herself as a cut above a policeman. But he had a way with\nhim. She soon gave him to understand that she was no snob, and when he\nmade the customary advances he discovered to his relief, for he was not\na man who considered that resistance added a flavour to conquest, that\nshe was no prude. He liked to be seen with her when he took her out to\ndinner. She talked intelligently, and she was economical. She knew where\nthey could dine well at the cheapest price. His situation was enviable.\nIt added to his satisfaction that he could gratify the sexual desires\nnatural to his healthy temperament at so moderate an expense. When she\ncame to him and said she was going to have a baby it seemed natural\nenough that they should get married. He was earning good wages, and it\nwas time that he should settle down. He often grew tired of eating, en\npension, at a restaurant, and he looked forward to having his own home\nand home cooking. Well, it turned out that it had been a mistake about\nthe baby, but Louis Remire was a good-natured fellow, and he didn't hold\nit up against Adèle. But he found, as many men have found before, that\nthe wife was a very different woman from the mistress. She was jealous\nand possessive. She seemed to think that on a Sunday afternoon he ought\nto take her for a walk instead of going out fishing, and she made it a\ngrievance that, on coming off duty, he would go to the café. There was\none café he frequented where other fishermen went and where he met men\nwith whom he had a lot in common. He found it much pleasanter to spend\nhis free evenings there over a glass or two of beer, whiling away the\ntime with a game of cards, than to sit at home with his wife. She began\nto make scenes. Though sociable and jovial by nature he had a quick\ntemper. There was a rough crowd at Lyons, and sometimes you could not\nmanage them unless you were prepared to show a certain amount of\nfirmness. When his wife began to make a nuisance of herself it never\noccurred to him that there was any other way of dealing with her than\nthat he adopted. He let her know the strength of his hand. If she had\nbeen a sensible woman she would have learnt her lesson, but she was not\na sensible woman. He found occasion more and more often to apply a\nnecessary correction; she revenged herself by screaming the place down\nand by telling the neighbours--they lived in a two-roomed apartment on\nthe fifth floor of a big house--what a brute he was. She told them that\nshe was sure he would kill her one day. And yet never was there a more\ngood-natured man than Louis Remire; she blamed him for the money he\nspent at the café, she accused him of wasting it on other women; well,\nin his position he had opportunities now and then, and as any man would,\nhe took them, and he was easy with his money, he never minded paying a\nround of drinks for his friends, and when a girl who had been nice to\nhim wanted a new hat or a pair of silk stockings he wasn't the man to\nsay no. His wife looked upon money that he did not spend on her as money\nstolen from her; she tried to make him account for every penny he spent,\nand when in his jovial way he told her he had thrown it out of the\nwindow, she was infuriated. Her tongue grew bitter and her voice was\nrasping. She was in a sullen rage with him all the time. She could not\nspeak without saying something disagreeable. They led a cat-and-dog\nlife. Louis Remire used to tell his friends what a harridan she was, he\nused to tell them that he wished ten times a day that he had never\nmarried her, and sometimes he would add that if an epidemic of influenza\ndid not carry her off he would really have to kill her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was these remarks, made merely in jest, and the fact that she had so\noften told the neighbours that she knew he would murder her, that had\nsent him to St. Laurent de Maroni with a twelve-year sentence. Otherwise\nhe might very well have got off with three or four years in a French\nprison. The end had come one hot summer's day. He was, which was rare\nfor him, in a bad temper. There was a strike in progress and the\nstrikers had been violent. The police had had to make a good many\narrests and the men had not submitted to this peaceably. Louis Remire\nhad got a nasty blow on the jaw and he had had to make free use of his\ntruncheon. To get the arrested men to the station had been a hot and\ntiring job. On coming off duty he had gone home to get out of his\nuniform and was intending to go to the café and have a glass of beer and\na pleasant game of cards. His jaw was hurting him. His wife chose that\nmoment to ask him for money and when he told her that he had none to\ngive her she made a scene. He had plenty of money to go to the café, but\nnone for her to buy a scrap of food with, she could starve for all he\ncared. He told her to shut up, and then the row began. She got in front\nof the door and swore that he should not pass till he gave her money. He\ntold her to get out of the way and took a step towards her. She whipped\nout his service revolver which he had taken off when he removed his\nuniform and threatened that she would shoot him if he moved a step. He\nwas used to dealing with dangerous criminals, and the words were hardly\nout of her mouth before he had sprung upon her and snatched the revolver\nout of her hand. She screamed and hit him in the face. She hit him\nexactly where his jaw most hurt him. Blind with rage and mad with pain,\nhe fired, he fired twice and she fell to the floor. For a moment he\nstood and stared at her. He was dazed. She looked as if she were dead.\nHis first feeling was one of indescribable relief. He listened. No one\nseemed to have heard the sound of the shot. The neighbours must be out.\nThat was a bit of luck, for it gave him time to do what he had to do in\nhis own way. He changed back into his uniform, went out, locking the\ndoor behind him and putting the key in his pocket; he stopped for five\nminutes at his familiar café to have a glass of beer and then returned\nto the police-station he had lately left. On account of the day's\ndisturbances the chief inspector was still there. Louis Remire went to\nhis room and told him what had happened. He spent the night in a cell\nadjoining those of the strikers he had so recently himself arrested.\nEven at that tragic moment he was struck by the irony of the situation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLouis Remire had on frequent occasions appeared as a police witness in\ncriminal cases and he knew how eager are a man's companions to give any\ninformation that may damage him when he gets into trouble. It had caused\nhim a certain grim amusement to realise how often it happened that a\nconviction was obtained only by the testimony of a prisoner's best\nfriends. But notwithstanding his experience he was amazed, when his own\ncase came up for trial, to listen to the evidence given by the\nproprietor of the little café he had so much frequented, and to that of\nthe men who for years had fished with him, played cards with him and\ndrunk with him. They seemed to have treasured every careless word he had\never uttered, the complaints he had made about his wife and the joking\nthreats he had from time to time made that he would get even with her.\nHe knew that at the time they had taken them no more seriously than he\nmeant them. If he was able to do them a small service, and a man in the\nforce often has it in his power to do one, he never hesitated. He had\nnever been ungenerous with his money. You would have thought as you\nlistened to them in the witness-box that it gave them the most intense\nsatisfaction to disclose every trivial detail that could damage him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFrom what appeared at the trial you would have thought that he was a bad\nman, dissolute, of violent temper, extravagant, idle and corrupt. He\nknew that he was nothing of the kind. He was just an ordinary,\ngood-natured, easy-going fellow, who was willing to let you go your way\nif you would let him go his. It was true that he liked his game of cards\nand his glass of beer, it was true that he liked a pretty girl, but what\nof it? When he looked at the jury he wondered how many of them would\ncome out of it any better than he if all their errors, all their rash\nwords, all their follies were thus laid bare. He did not resent the long\nterm of penal servitude to which he was sentenced. He was an officer of\nthe law; he had committed a crime and it was right that he should be\npunished. But he was not a criminal; he was the victim of an unfortunate\naccident.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt St. Laurent de Maroni, in the prison camp, wearing the pink and white\nstripe of the prison garb and the ugly straw hat, he remembered still\nthat he had been a policeman and that the convicts with whom he must now\nconsort had always been his natural enemies. He despised and disliked\nthem. He had as little to do with them as he could. And he was not\nfrightened of them. He knew them too well. Like all the rest he had a\nknife and he showed that he was prepared to use it. He did not want to\ninterfere with anybody, but he was not going to allow anyone to\ninterfere with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe chief of the Lyons police had liked him, his character while in the\nforce had been exemplary, and the <i>fiche</i> which accompanied every\nprisoner spoke well of him. He knew that what officials like is a\nprisoner who gives no trouble, who accepts his position with\ncheerfulness and who is willing. He got a soft job; very soon he got a\ncell of his own and so escaped the horrible promiscuity of the\ndormitories; he got on well with the warders, they were decent chaps,\nmost of them, and knowing that he had formerly been in the police they\ntreated him more as a comrade than as a convict. The commandant of the\nprison trusted him. Presently he got the job of servant to one of the\nprison officials. He slept in the prison, but otherwise enjoyed complete\nfreedom. He took the children of his master to school every day and\nfetched them at the end of their school hours. He made toys for them. He\naccompanied his mistress to market and carried back the provisions she\nbought. He spent long hours gossiping with her. The family liked him.\nThey liked his chaffing manner and his good-natured smile. He was\nindustrious and trustworthy. Life once more was tolerable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut after three years his master was transferred to Cayenne. It was a\nblow. But it happened just then that the post of executioner fell free\nand he obtained it. Now once more he was in the service of the state. He\nwas an official. However humble his residence it was his own. He need no\nlonger wear the prison uniform. He could grow his hair and his\nmoustache. He cared little if the convicts looked upon him with horror\nand contempt. That was how he looked upon them. Scum. When he took the\nbleeding head of an executed man from the basket and holding it by the\nears pronounced those solemn words: <i>Au nom du peuple français justice\nest faite</i>, he felt that he did represent the Republic. He stood for law\nand order. He was the protector of society against that vast horde of\nruthless criminals.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got a hundred francs for each execution. That and what the governor's\nwife paid him for his fish provided him with many a pleasant comfort and\nnot a few luxuries. And now as he sat on his rock in the peace of\neventide he considered what he would do with the money he would earn\nnext day. Occasionally he got a bite, now and then a fish; he drew it\nout of the water, took it off the hook and put on fresh bait; but he did\nthis mechanically, and it did not disturb the current of his thoughts.\nSix hundred francs. It was a respectable sum. He scarcely knew what to\ndo with it. He had everything he wanted in his little house, he had a\ngood store of groceries, and plenty of rum for one who was as little of\na drinker as he was; he needed no fishing tackle; his clothes were good\nenough. The only thing was to put it aside. He already had a tidy little\nsum hidden in the ground at the root of a papaya tree. He chuckled when\nhe thought how Adèle would have stared had she known that he was\nactually saving. It would have been balm to her avaricious soul. He was\nsaving up gradually for when he was released. That was the difficult\nmoment for the convicts. So long as they were in prison they had a roof\nover their heads and food to eat, but when they were released, with the\nobligation of staying for so many years more in the colony, they had to\nshift for themselves. They all said the same thing: it was at the\nexpiration of their term that their real punishment began. They could\nnot get work. Employers mistrusted them. Contractors would not engage\nthem because the prison authorities hired out convict labour at a price\nthat defied competition. They slept in the open, in the market-place,\nand for food were often glad to go to the Salvation Army. But the\nSalvation Army made them work hard for what they gave and besides forced\nthem to listen to their services. Sometimes they committed a violent\ncrime merely to get back to the safety of prison. Louis Remire was not\ngoing to take any risks. He meant to amass a sufficient capital to start\nin business. He ought to be able to get permission to settle in Cayenne,\nand there he might open a bar. People might hesitate to come at first\nbecause he had been the executioner, but if he provided good liquor they\nwould get over their prejudice, and with his jovial manner, with his\nexperience in keeping order, he ought to be able to make a go of it.\nVisitors came to Cayenne now and then and they would come out of\ncuriosity. It would be something interesting to tell their friends when\nthey got home that the best rum punch they had had in Cayenne was at the\nexecutioner's. But he had a good many years to go yet, and if there\nreally was something he needed there was no reason why he shouldn't get\nit. He racked his brains. No, there wasn't a thing in the world he\nwanted. He was surprised. He allowed his eyes to wander from his float.\nThe sea was wonderfully calm and now it was rich with all the colour of\nthe setting sun. In the sky already a solitary star twinkled. A thought\ncame to him that filled him with an extraordinary sensation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But if there's nothing in the world you want, surely that's happiness.\"\nHe stroked his handsome moustache and his blue eyes shone softly. \"There\nare no two ways about it, I'm a happy man and till this moment I never\nknew it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe notion was so unexpected that he did not know what to make of it. It\nwas certainly a very odd one. But there it was, as obvious to anyone\nwith a logical mind as a proposition of Euclid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Happy, that's what I am. How many men can say the same? In St. Laurent\nde Maroni of all places, and for the first time in my life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe sun was setting. He had caught enough fish for his supper and enough\nfor his breakfast. He drew in his line, gathered up his fish, and went\nback to his house. It stood but a few yards from the sea. It did not\ntake him long to light his fire and in a little while he had four little\nfish cheerfully frizzling in a pan. He was always very particular about\nthe oil he used. The best olive oil was expensive, but it was worth the\nmoney. The prison bread was good, and after he had fried his fish, he\nfried a couple of pieces of bread in the rest of the oil. He sniffed the\nsavoury smell with satisfaction. He lit a lamp, washed a lettuce grown\nin his own garden, and mixed himself a salad. He had a notion that no\none in the world could mix a salad better than he. He drank a glass of\nrum and ate his supper with appetite. He gave a few odds and ends to the\ntwo mongrel dogs who were lying at his feet, and then, having washed up,\nfor he was by nature a tidy man and when he came in to breakfast next\nmorning did not want to find things in a mess, let the dogs out of the\ncompound to wander about the coconut grove. He took the lamp into the\nhouse, made himself comfortable in his deck-chair, and smoking a cigar\nsmuggled in from the neighbouring Dutch Colony settled down to read one\nof the French papers that had arrived by the last mail. Replete, his\nmind at ease, he could not but feel that life, with all its\ndisadvantages, was good to live. He was still affected by the amused\nsurprise that had overcome him when it suddenly occurred to him that he\nwas a happy man. When you considered that men spent their lives seeking\nfor happiness, it seemed hardly believable that he had found it. Yet the\nfact stared him in the face. A man who has everything he wants is happy,\nhe had everything he wanted; therefore he was happy. He chuckled as a\nnew thought crossed his mind.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no denying it, I owe it to Adèle.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOld Adèle. What a foul woman!\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPresently he decided that he had better have a nap; he set his alarm\nclock for a quarter to twelve and lying down on his bed in a few minutes\nwas fast asleep. He slept soundly and no dreams troubled him. He woke\nwith a start when the alarm sounded, but in a moment remembered why he\nhad set it. He yawned and stretched himself lazily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah, well, I suppose I must get to work. Every job has its\ninconveniences.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe slipped from under his mosquito-net and relit his lamp. To freshen\nhimself he washed his hands and face, and then as a protection against\nthe night air drank a glass of rum. He thought for a moment of his\ninexperienced assistant and wondered whether it would be wise to take\nsome rum in a flask with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be a pretty business if his nerves went back on him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was unfortunate that so many as six men had to be executed. If there\nhad been only one, it wouldn't have mattered so much his assistant being\nnew to the game; but with five others waiting there, it would be awkward\nif there were a hitch. He shrugged his shoulders. They would just have\nto do the best they could. He passed a comb through his tousled hair and\ncarefully brushed his handsome moustache. He lit a cigarette. He walked\nthrough his compound, unlocked the door in the stout palisade that\nsurrounded it, and locked it again behind him. There was no moon. He\nwhistled for his dogs. He was surprised that they did not come. He\nwhistled again. The brutes. They'd probably caught a rat and were\nfighting over it. He'd give them a good hiding for that; he'd teach them\nnot to come when he whistled. He set out to walk in the direction of the\nprison. It was dark under the coconut trees and he would just as soon\nhave had the dogs with him. Still there were only fifty yards to go and\nthen he would be out in the open. There were lights in the governor's\nhouse, and it gave him confidence to see them. He smiled, for he guessed\nwhat those lights at that late hour meant; the governor, with the\nexecution before him at dawn, was finding it hard to sleep. The anxiety,\nthe malaise, that affected convicts and ex-convicts alike on the eve of\nan execution, had got on his nerves. It was true that there was always\nthe chance of an outbreak then, and the warders went around with their\neyes skinned and their hands ready to draw their guns at a suspicious\nmovement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLouis Remire whistled for his dogs once more, but they did not come. He\ncould not understand it. It was a trifle disquieting. He was a man who\nhabitually walked slowly, strolling along with a sort of roll, but now\nhe hastened his pace. He spat the cigarette out of his mouth. It had\nstruck him that it was prudent not to betray his whereabouts by the\nlight it gave. Suddenly he stumbled against something. He stopped dead.\nHe was a brave man, with nerves of steel, but on a sudden he felt sick\nwith terror. It was something soft and rather large that he had stumbled\nagainst, and he was pretty sure what it was. He wore espadrilles, and\nwith one foot he cautiously felt the object on the ground before him.\nYes, he was right. It was one of his dogs. It was dead. He took a step\nbackwards and drew his knife. He knew it was no good to shout. The only\nhouse in the neighbourhood was the prison governor's, it faced the\nclearing just beyond the coconut grove; but they would not hear him, or\nif they did would not stir. St. Laurent de Maroni was not a place where\nyou went out in the dead of night when you heard a man calling for help.\nIf next day one of the freed convicts was found lying dead, well, it was\nno great loss. Louis Remire saw in a flash what had happened.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe thought rapidly. They had killed his dogs while he was sleeping. They\nmust have got them when he had put them out of his compound after\nsupper. They must have thrown them some poisoned meat and the brutes had\nsnatched at it. If the one he had stumbled over was near his house it\nwas because it tried to crawl home to die. Louis Remire strained his\neyes. He could see nothing. The night was pitch black. He could hardly\nsee the trunks of the coconut trees a yard away from him. His first\nthought was to make a rush for his shack. If he got back to the safety\nof that he could wait till the prison people, wondering why he did not\ncome, sent to fetch him. But he knew he could never get back. He knew\nthey were there in the darkness, the men who had killed his dogs; he\nwould have to fumble with the key to find the lock and before he found\nit he would have a knife plunged in his back. He listened intently.\nThere was not a sound. And yet he felt that there were men there,\nlurking behind the trees, and they were there to kill him. They would\nkill him as they had killed his dogs. And he would die like a dog. There\nwas more than one certainly. He knew them, there were three or four of\nthem at least, there might be more, convicts in service in private\nhouses who were not obliged to get back to the camp till a late hour, or\ndesperate and starving freed men who had nothing to lose. For a moment\nhe hesitated what to do. He dared not make a run for it, they might\neasily have put a rope across the pathway that led from his house to the\nopen, and if he tripped he was done for. The coconut trees were loosely\nplanted and among them his enemies would see him as little as he saw\nthem. He stepped over the dead dog and plunged into the grove. He stood\nwith his back to a tree to decide how he should proceed. The silence was\nterrifying. Suddenly he heard a whisper and the horror of it was\nfrightful. Again a dead silence. He felt he must move on, but his feet\nseemed rooted to the ground. He felt that they were peering at him out\nof the darkness and it seemed to him that he was as visible to them as\nthough he stood in the broad light of day. Then from the other side was\na little cough. It came as such a shock that Louis Remire nearly\nscreamed. He was conscious now that they were all round him. He could\nexpect no mercy from those robbers and murderers. He remembered the\nother executioner, his predecessor, whom they had carried still alive\ninto the jungle, whose eyes they had gouged out, and whom they had left\nhanging for the vultures to devour. His knees began to tremble. What a\nfool he had been to take on the job! There were soft jobs he could have\nfound in which you ran no risk. It was too late to think of that. He\npulled himself together. He had no chance of getting out of the coconut\ngrove alive, he knew that; he wanted to be sure that he would be dead.\nHe tightened his grip on his knife. The awful part was that he could\nhear no one, he could see no one, and yet he knew that they were lurking\nthere waiting to strike. For one moment he had a mad idea, he would\nthrow his knife away and shout out to them that he was unarmed and they\ncould come and kill him in safety. But he knew them; they would never be\nsatisfied merely to kill him. Rage seized him. He was not the man to\nsurrender tamely to a pack of criminals. He was an honest man and an\nofficial of the state; it was his duty to defend himself. He could not\nstay there all night. It was better to get it over quickly. Yet that\ntree at his back seemed to offer a sort of security, he could not bring\nhimself to move. He stared at the trunk of a tree in front of him and\nsuddenly it moved and he realised with horror that it was a man. That\nmade up his mind for him and with a huge effort he stepped forwards. He\nadvanced slowly and cautiously. He could hear nothing, he could see\nnothing. But he knew that as he advanced they advanced too. It was as\nthough he were accompanied by an invisible bodyguard. He thought he\ncould hear the sound of their naked feet on the ground. His fear had\nleft him. He walked on, keeping as close to the trees as he could, so\nthat they should have less chance of attacking him from behind; a wild\nhope sprang up in his breast that they would be afraid to strike, they\nknew him, they all knew him, and whoever struck the first blow would be\nlucky if he escaped a knife in his own guts; he had only another thirty\nyards to go, and once in the open, able to see, he could make a fight\nfor it. A few yards more and then he would run for his life. Suddenly\nsomething happened that made him start out of his skin, and he stopped\ndead. A light was flashed and in that heavy darkness the sudden glare\nwas terrifying. It was an electric torch. Instinctively he sprang to a\ntree and stood with his back to it. He could not see who held the light.\nHe was blinded by it. He did not speak. He held his knife low, he knew\nthat when they struck it was in the belly, and if someone flung himself\nat him he was prepared to strike back. He was going to sell his life\ndearly. For half a minute perhaps the light shone on his face, but it\nseemed to him an eternity. He thought now that he discerned dimly the\nfaces of men. Then a word broke the horrible silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Throw.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt the same instant a knife came flying through the air and struck him\non the breast-bone. He threw up his hands and as he did so someone\nsprang at him and with a great sweep of the knife ripped up his belly.\nThe light was switched off. Louis Remire sank to the ground with a\ngroan, a terrible groan of pain. Five, six men gathered out of the gloom\nand stood over him. With his fall the knife that had stuck in his\nbreast-bone was dislodged. It lay on the ground. A quick flash of the\ntorch showed where it was. One of the men took it and with a single,\nswift motion cut Remire's throat from ear to ear.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Au nom du peuple français justice est faite</i>,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey vanished into the darkness and in the coconut grove was the immense\nsilence of death.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nCaptain Erdmann knew Miss Reid very little till the <i>Friedrich Weber</i>\nreached Haiti. She came on board at Plymouth, but by then he had taken\non a number of passengers, French, Belgian and Haitian, many of whom had\ntravelled with him before, and she was placed at the chief engineer's\ntable. The <i>Friedrich Weber</i> was a freighter sailing regularly from\nHamburg to Cartagena on the Colombian coast and on the way touching at a\nnumber of islands in the West Indies. She carried phosphates and cement\nfrom Germany and took back coffee and timber; but her owners, the\nBrothers Weber, were always willing to send her out of her route if a\ncargo of any sort made it worth their while. The <i>Friedrich Weber</i> was\nprepared to take cattle, mules, potatoes or anything else that offered\nthe chance of earning an honest penny. She carried passengers. There\nwere six cabins on the upper deck and six below. The accommodation was\nnot luxurious, but the food was good, plain and abundant, and the fares\nwere cheap. The round trip took nine weeks and was not costing Miss Reid\nmore than forty-five pounds. She looked forward not only to seeing many\ninteresting places, with historical associations, but also to acquiring\na great deal of information that would enrich her mind.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe agent had warned her that till the ship reached Port au Prince in\nHaiti she would have to share a cabin with another woman. Miss Reid did\nnot mind that, she liked company, and when the steward told her that her\ncompanion was Madame Bollin she thought at once that it would be a very\ngood opportunity to rub up her French. She was only very slightly\ndisconcerted when she found that Madame Bollin was coal-black. She told\nherself that one had to accept the rough with the smooth and that it\ntakes all sorts to make a world. Miss Reid was a good sailor, as indeed\nwas only to be expected since her grandfather had been a naval officer,\nbut after a couple of roughish days the weather was fine and in a very\nshort while she knew all her fellow-passengers. She was a good mixer.\nThat was one of the reasons why she had made a success of her business;\nshe owned a tea-room at a celebrated beauty spot in the west of England\nand she always had a smile and a pleasant word for every customer who\ncame in; she closed down in the winter and for the last four years had\ntaken a cruise. You met such interesting people, she said, and you\nalways learnt something. It was true that the passengers on the\n<i>Friedrich Weber</i> weren't of quite so good a class as those she had met\nthe year before on her Mediterranean cruise, but Miss Reid was not a\nsnob, and though the table manners of some of them shocked her somewhat,\ndetermined to look upon the bright side of things she decided to make\nthe best of them. She was a great reader and she was glad, on looking at\nthe ship's library, to find that there were a lot of books by Phillips\nOppenheim, Edgar Wallace and Agatha Christie; but with so many people to\ntalk to she had no time for reading and she made up her mind to leave\nthem till the ship emptied herself at Haiti.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"After all,\" she said, \"human nature is more important than literature.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Reid had always had the reputation of being a good talker and she\nflattered herself that not once during the many days they were at sea\nhad she allowed the conversation at table to languish. She knew how to\ndraw people out, and whenever a topic seemed to be exhausted she had a\nremark ready to revive it or another topic waiting on the tip of her\ntongue to set the conversation off again. Her friend Miss Prince,\ndaughter of the late Vicar of Campden, who had come to see her off at\nPlymouth, for she lived there, had often said to her:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know, Venetia, you have a mind like a man. You're never at a loss\nfor something to say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I think if you're interested in everyone, everyone will be\ninterested in you,\" Miss Reid answered modestly. \"Practice makes\nperfect, and I have the infinite capacity for taking pains which Dickens\nsaid was genius.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Reid was not really called Venetia, her name was Alice, but\ndisliking it she had, when still a girl, adopted the poetic name which\nshe felt so much better suited to her personality.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Reid had a great many interesting talks with her fellow-passengers\nand she was really sorry when the ship at length reached Port au Prince\nand the last of them disembarked. The <i>Friedrich Weber</i> stopped two days\nthere, during which she visited the town and the neighbourhood. When\nthey sailed she was the only passenger. The ship was skirting the coast\nof the island stopping off at a variety of ports to discharge or to take\non cargo.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope you will not feel embarrassed alone with so many men, Miss\nReid,\" said the captain heartily as they sat down to midday dinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was placed on his right hand and at table besides sat the first\nmate, the chief engineer and the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm a woman of the world, Captain. I always think if a lady is a lady\ngentlemen will be gentlemen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We're only rough sailor men, madam, you mustn't expect too much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Kind hearts are more than coronets and simple faith than Norman blood,\nCaptain,\" answered Miss Reid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was a short, thick-set man, with a clean-shaven head and a red,\nclean-shaven face. He wore a white stengah-shifter, but except at\nmeal-times unbuttoned at the neck and showing his hairy chest. He was a\njovial fellow. He could not speak without bellowing. Miss Reid thought\nhim quite an eccentric, but she had a keen sense of humour and was\nprepared to make allowances for that. She took the conversation in hand.\nShe had learnt a great deal about Haiti on the voyage out and more\nduring the two days she had spent there, but she knew that men liked to\ntalk rather than to listen, so she put them a number of questions to\nwhich she already knew the answers; oddly enough they didn't. In the end\nshe found herself obliged to give quite a little lecture, and before\ndinner was over, <i>Mittag Essen</i> they called it in their funny way, she\nhad imparted to them a great deal of interesting information about the\nhistory and economic situation of the Republic, the problems that\nconfronted it and its prospects for the future. She talked rather\nslowly, in a refined voice, and her vocabulary was extensive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt nightfall they put in at a small port where they were to load three\nhundred bags of coffee, and the agent came on board. The captain asked\nhim to stay to supper and ordered cocktails. As the steward brought them\nMiss Reid swam into the saloon. Her movements were deliberate, elegant\nand self-assured. She always said that you could tell at once by the way\nshe walked if a woman was a lady. The captain introduced the agent to\nher and she sat down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is that you men are drinking?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A cocktail. Will you have one, Miss Reid?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't mind if I do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe drank it and the captain somewhat doubtfully asked her if she would\nhave another.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Another? Well, just to be matey.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe agent, much whiter than some, but a good deal darker than many, was\nthe son of a former minister of Haiti to the German court, and having\nlived for many years in Berlin spoke good German. It was indeed on this\naccount that he had got a job with a German shipping firm. On the\nstrength of this Miss Reid, during supper, told them all about a trip\ndown the Rhine that she had once taken. Afterwards she and the agent,\nthe skipper, the doctor and the mate sat round a table and drank beer.\nMiss Reid made it her business to draw the agent out. The fact that they\nwere loading coffee suggested to her that he would be interested in\nlearning how they grew tea in Ceylon, yes, she had been to Ceylon on a\ncruise, and the fact that his father was a diplomat made it certain that\nhe would be interested in the royal family of England. She had a very\npleasant evening. When she at last retired to rest, for she would never\nhave thought of saying she was going to bed, she said to herself:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no doubt that travel is a great education.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was really an experience to find herself alone with all those men.\nHow they would laugh when she told them all about it when she got home!\nThey would say that things like that only happened to Venetia. She\nsmiled when she heard the captain on deck singing with that great\nbooming voice of his. Germans were so musical. He had a funny way of\nstrutting up and down on his short legs singing Wagner tunes to words of\nhis own invention. It was <i>Tannhaüser</i> he was singing now (that lovely\nthing about the evening star) but knowing no German Miss Reid could only\nwonder what absurd words he was putting to it. It was as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, what a bore that woman is, I shall certainly kill her if she goes\non much longer.\" Then he broke into Siegfried's martial strain. \"She's a\nbore, she's a bore, she's a bore. I shall throw her into the sea.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd that of course is what Miss Reid was. She was a crashing, she was a\nstupendous, she was an excruciating bore. She talked in a steady\nmonotone, and it was no use to interrupt her because then she started\nagain from the beginning. She had an insatiable thirst for information\nand no casual remark could be thrown across the table without her asking\ninnumerable questions about it. She was a great dreamer and she narrated\nher dreams at intolerable length. There was no subject upon which she\nhad not something prosy to say. She had a truism for every occasion. She\nhit on the commonplace like a hammer driving a nail into the wall. She\nplunged into the obvious like a clown in a circus jumping through a\nhoop. Silence did not abash her. Those poor men far away from their\nhomes and the patter of little feet, and with Christmas coming on, no\nwonder they felt low; she redoubled her efforts to interest and amuse\nthem. She was determined to bring a little gaiety into their dull lives.\nFor that was the awful part of it: Miss Reid meant well. She was not\nonly having a good time herself, but she was trying to give all of them\na good time. She was convinced that they liked her as much as she liked\nthem. She felt that she was doing her bit to make the party a success\nand she was naïvely happy to think that she was succeeding. She told\nthem all about her friend Miss Price and how often she had said to her:\nVenetia, no one ever has a dull moment in your company. It was the\ncaptain's duty to be polite to a passenger and however much he would\nhave liked to tell her to hold her silly tongue he could not, but even\nif he had been free to say what he liked, he knew that he could not have\nbrought himself to hurt her feelings. Nothing stemmed the torrent of her\nloquacity. It was as irresistible as a force of nature. Once in\ndesperation they began talking German, but Miss Reid stopped this at\nonce.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now I won't have you saying things I don't understand. You ought all to\nmake the most of your good luck in having me all to yourselves and\npractise your English.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We were talking of technical matters that would only bore you, Miss\nReid,\" said the captain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm never bored. That's why, if you won't think me a wee bit conceited\nto say so, I'm never boring. You see, I like to know things. Everything\ninterests me and you never know when a bit of information won't come in\nuseful.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor smiled dryly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The captain was only saying that because he was embarrassed. In point\nof fact he was telling a story that was not fit for the ears of a maiden\nlady.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I may be a maiden lady but I'm also a woman of the world, I don't\nexpect sailors to be saints. You need never be afraid of what you say\nbefore me, Captain, I shan't be shocked. I should love to hear your\nstory.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor was a man of sixty with thin grey hair, a grey moustache and\nsmall bright blue eyes. He was a silent, bitter man, and however hard\nMiss Reid tried to bring him into the conversation it was almost\nimpossible to get a word out of him. But she wasn't a woman who would\ngive in without a struggle, and one morning when they were at sea and\nshe saw him sitting on deck with a book, she brought her chair next to\nhis and sat down beside him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you fond of reading, Doctor?\" she said brightly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So am I. And I suppose like all Germans you're musical.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm fond of music.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"So am I. The moment I saw you I thought you looked clever.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave her a brief look and pursing his lips went on reading. Miss Reid\nwas not disconcerted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But of course one can always read. I always prefer a good talk to a\ngood book. Don't you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How very interesting. Now do tell me why?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't give you a reason.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's very strange, isn't it? But then I always think human nature is\nstrange. I'm terribly interested in people, you know. I always like\ndoctors, they know so much about human nature, but I could tell you some\nthings that would surprise even you. You learn a great deal about people\nif you run a tea-shop like I do, that's to say if you keep your eyes\nopen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor got up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I must ask you to excuse me, Miss Reid. I have to go and see a\npatient.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Anyhow I've broken the ice now,\" she thought, as he walked away. \"I\nthink he was only shy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut a day or two later the doctor was not feeling at all well. He had an\ninternal malady that troubled him now and then, but he was used to it\nand disinclined to talk about it. When he had one of his attacks he only\nwanted to be left alone. His cabin was small and stuffy, so he settled\nhimself on a long chair on deck and lay with his eyes closed. Miss Reid\nwas walking up and down to get the half-hour's exercise she took morning\nand evening. He thought that if he pretended to be asleep she would not\ndisturb him. But when she had passed him half a dozen times she stopped\nin front of him and stood quite still. Though he kept his eyes closed he\nknew that she was looking at him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is there anything I can do, Doctor?\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe started.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why, what should there be?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave her a glance and saw that her eyes were deeply troubled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You look dreadfully ill,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm in great pain.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know. I can see that. Can't something be done?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, it'll pass off presently.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe hesitated for a moment then went away. Presently she returned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You look so uncomfortable with no cushions or anything. I've brought\nyou my own pillow that I always travel with. Do let me put it behind\nyour head.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe felt at that moment too ill to remonstrate. She lifted his head\ngently and put the soft pillow behind it. It really did make him feel\nmore comfortable. She passed her hand across his forehead and it was\ncool and soft.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Poor dear,\" she said. \"I know what doctors are. They haven't the first\nidea how to take care of themselves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe left him, but in a minute or two returned with a chair and a bag.\nThe doctor when he saw her gave a twitch of anguish.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now I'm not going to let you talk, I'm just going to sit beside you and\nknit. I always think it's a comfort when one isn't feeling very well to\nhave someone near.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe sat down and taking an unfinished muffler out of her bag began\nbusily to ply her needles. She never said a word. And strangely enough\nthe doctor found her company a solace. No one else on board had even\nnoticed that he was ill, he had felt lonely, and the sympathy of that\ncrashing bore was grateful to him. It soothed him to see her silently\nworking and presently he fell asleep. When he awoke she was still\nworking. She gave him a little smile, but did not speak. His pain had\nleft him and he felt much better.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not go into the saloon till late in the afternoon. He found the\ncaptain and Hans Krause, the mate, having a glass of beer together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sit down, Doctor,\" said the captain. \"We're holding a council of war.\nYou know that the day after to-morrow is Sylvester Abend.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSylvester Abend, New Year's Eve, is an occasion that means a great deal\nto a German and they had all been looking forward to it. They had\nbrought a Christmas tree all the way from Germany with them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At dinner to-day Miss Reid was more talkative than ever. Hans and I\nhave decided that something must be done about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She sat with me for two hours this morning in silence. I suppose she\nwas making up for lost time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's bad enough to be away from one's home and family just now anyway\nand all we can do is to make the best of a bad job. We want to enjoy our\nSylvester Abend, and unless something is done about Miss Reid we haven't\na chance.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We can't have a good time if she's with us,\" said the mate. \"She'll\nspoil it as sure as eggs is eggs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How do you propose to get rid of her, short of throwing her overboard?\"\nsmiled the doctor. \"She's not a bad old soul; all she wants is a lover.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At her age?\" cried Hans Krause.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Especially at her age. That inordinate loquacity, that passion for\ninformation, the innumerable questions she asks, her prosiness, the way\nshe goes on and on--it is all a sign of her clamouring virginity. A\nlover would bring her peace. Those jangled nerves of hers would relax.\nAt least for an hour she would have lived. The deep satisfaction which\nher being demands would travel through those exacerbated centres of\nspeech, and we should have quiet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was always a little difficult to know how much the doctor meant what\nhe said and when he was having a joke at your expense. The captain's\nblue eyes, however, twinkled mischievously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Doctor, I have great confidence in your powers of diagnosis. The\nremedy you suggest is evidently worth trying, and since you are a\nbachelor it is clear that it is up to you to apply it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Pardon me, Captain, it is my professional duty to prescribe remedies\nfor the patients under my charge in this ship, but not to administer\nthem personally. Besides, I am sixty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am a married man with grown-up children,\" said the captain. \"I am old\nand fat and asthmatic, it is obvious that I cannot be expected to\nundertake a task of this kind. Nature cut me out for the rôle of a\nhusband and father, not for that of a lover.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Youth in these matters is essential and good looks are advantageous,\"\nsaid the doctor gravely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe captain gave a great bang on the table with his fist.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are thinking of Hans. You're quite right. Hans must do it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe mate sprang to his feet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Me? Never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hans, you are tall, handsome, strong as a lion, brave and young. We\nhave twenty-three days more at sea before we reach Hamburg, you wouldn't\ndesert your trusted old captain in an emergency or let down your good\nfriend the doctor?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, Captain, it's asking too much of me. I have been married less than\na year and I love my wife. I can hardly wait to get back to Hamburg. She\nis yearning for me as I am yearning for her. I will not be unfaithful to\nher, especially with Miss Reid.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Miss Reid's not so bad,\" said the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Some people might call her even nice-looking,\" said the captain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd indeed when you took Miss Reid feature by feature she was not in\nfact a plain woman. True, she had a long, stupid face, but her brown\neyes were large and she had very thick lashes; her brown hair was cut\nshort and curled rather prettily over her neck; she hadn't a bad skin,\nand she was neither too fat nor too thin. She was not old as people go\nnowadays, and if she had told you that she was forty you would have been\nquite willing to believe it. The only thing against her was that she was\ndrab and dull.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Must I then for twenty-three mortal days endure the prolixity of that\ntedious woman? Must I for twenty-three mortal days answer her inane\nquestions and listen to her fatuous remarks? Must I, an old man, have my\nSylvester Abend, the jolly evening I was looking forward to, ruined by\nthe unwelcome company of that intolerable virgin? And all because no one\ncan be found to show a little gallantry, a little human kindness, a\nspark of charity to a lonely woman. I shall wreck the ship.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's always the radio-operator,\" said Hans.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe captain gave a loud shout.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hans, let the ten thousand virgins of Cologne arise and call you\nblessed. Steward,\" he bellowed, \"tell the radio-operator that I want\nhim.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe radio-operator came into the saloon and smartly clicked his heels\ntogether. The three men looked at him in silence. He wondered uneasily\nwhether he had done something for which he was to be hauled over the\ncoals. He was above the middle height, with square shoulders and narrow\nhips, erect and slender, his tanned, smooth skin looked as though a\nrazor had never touched it, he had large eyes of a startling blue and a\nmane of curling golden hair. He was a perfect specimen of young Teutonic\nmanhood. He was so healthy, so vigorous, so much alive that even when he\nstood some way from you, you felt the glow of his vitality.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Aryan, all right,\" said the captain. \"No doubt about that. How old are\nyou, my boy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Twenty-one, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Married?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Engaged?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe radio-operator chuckled. There was an engaging boyishness in his\nlaugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You know that we have a female passenger on board?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you know her?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've said good-morning to her when I've seen her on deck.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe captain assumed his most official manner. His eyes, which generally\ntwinkled with fun, were stern and he got a sort of bark into his rich,\nfruity voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Although this is a cargo-boat and we carry valuable freight, we also\ntake such passengers as we can get, and this is a branch of our business\nthat the company is anxious to encourage. My instructions are to do\neverything possible to promote the happiness and comfort of the\npassengers. Miss Reid needs a lover. The doctor and I have come to the\nconclusion that you are well suited to satisfy Miss Reid's\nrequirements.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Me, sir?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe radio-operator blushed scarlet and then began to giggle, but quickly\ncomposed himself when he saw the set faces of the three men who\nconfronted him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But she's old enough to be my mother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That at your age is a matter of no consequence. She is a woman of the\nhighest distinction and allied to all the great families of England. If\nshe were German she would be at least a countess. That you should have\nbeen chosen for this responsible position is an honour that you should\ngreatly appreciate. Furthermore, your English is halting and this will\ngive you an excellent opportunity to improve it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That of course is something to be thought of,\" said the radio-operator.\n\"I know that I want practice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is not often in this life that it is possible to combine pleasure\nwith intellectual improvement, and you must congratulate yourself on\nyour good fortune.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But if I may be allowed to put the question, sir, why does Miss Reid\nwant a lover?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It appears to be an old English custom for unmarried women of exalted\nrank to submit themselves to the embraces of a lover at this time of\nyear. The company is anxious that Miss Reid should be treated exactly as\nshe would be on an English ship, and we trust that if she is satisfied,\nwith her aristocratic connections she will be able to persuade many of\nher friends to take cruises in the line's ships.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sir, I must ask to be excused.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is not a request that I am making, it is an order. You will present\nyourself to Miss Reid, in her cabin, at eleven o'clock to-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What shall I do when I get there?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do?\" thundered the captain. \"Do? Act naturally.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWith a wave of the hand he dismissed him. The radio-operator clicked his\nheels, saluted and went out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now let us have another glass of beer,\" said the captain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt supper that evening Miss Reid was at her best. She was verbose. She\nwas playful. She was refined. There was not a truism that she failed to\nutter. There was not a commonplace that she forebore to express. She\nbombarded them with foolish questions. The captain's face grew redder\nand redder as he sought to contain his fury; he felt that he could not\ngo on being polite to her any longer and if the doctor's remedy did not\nhelp, one day he would forget himself and give her, not a piece, but the\nwhole of his mind.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall lose my job,\" he thought, \"but I'm not sure that it wouldn't be\nworth it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext day they were already sitting at table when she came in to dinner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sylvester Abend to-morrow,\" she said, brightly. That was the sort of\nthing she would say. She went on: \"Well, what have you all been up to\nthis morning?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSince they did exactly the same thing every day, and she knew very well\nwhat that was, the question was enraging. The captain's heart sank. He\nbriefly told the doctor what he thought of him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now, no German, please,\" said Miss Reid archly. \"You know I don't allow\nthat, and why, Captain, did you give the poor doctor that sour look?\nIt's Christmas time, you know; peace and goodwill to all men. I'm so\nexcited about to-morrow evening, and will there be candles on the\nChristmas tree?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Naturally.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How thrilling! I always think a Christmas tree without candles isn't a\nChristmas tree. Oh, d'you know, I had such a funny experience last\nnight. I can't understand it at all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA startled pause. They all looked intently at Miss Reid. For once they\nhung on her lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes,\" she went on in that monotonous, rather finicking way of hers, \"I\nwas just getting into bed last night when there was a knock at my door.\n'Who is it?' I said. 'It's the radio-operator,' was the answer. 'What is\nit?' I said. 'Can I speak to you?' he said.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey listened with rapt attention.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Well, I'll just pop on a dressing-gown,' I said, 'and open the door.'\nSo I popped on a dressing-gown and opened the door. The radio-operator\nsaid: 'Excuse me, miss, but do you want to send a radio?' Well, I did\nthink it was funny his coming at that hour to ask me if I wanted to send\na radio, I just laughed in his face, it appealed to my sense of humour\nif you understand what I mean, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings so\nI said: 'Thank you so much, but I don't think I want to send a radio.'\nHe stood there, looking so funny, as if he was quite embarrassed, so I\nsaid: 'Thank you all the same for asking me,' and then I said\n'Good-night, pleasant dreams' and shut the door.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The damned fool,\" cried the captain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's young, Miss Reid,\" the doctor put in. \"It was excess of zeal. I\nsuppose he thought you would want to send a New Year's greeting to your\nfriends and he wished you to get the advantage of the special rate.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I didn't mind at all. I like these queer little things that happen\nto one when one's travelling. I just get a good laugh out of them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs soon as dinner was over and Miss Reid had left them the captain sent\nfor the radio-operator.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You idiot, what in heaven's name made you ask Miss Reid last night\nwhether she wanted to send a radio?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sir, you told me to act naturally. I am a radio-operator. I thought it\nnatural to ask her if she wanted to send a radio. I didn't know what\nelse to say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"God in heaven,\" shouted the captain, \"when Siegfried saw Brunhilde\nlying on her rock and cried: <i>Das ist kein Mann</i>,\" (the captain sang the\nwords, and being pleased with the sound of his voice, repeated the\nphrase two or three times before he continued), \"did Siegfried when she\nawoke ask her if she wished to send a radio, to announce to her papa, I\nsuppose, that she was sitting up after her long sleep and taking\nnotice?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I beg most respectfully to draw your attention to the fact that\nBrunhilde was Siegfried's aunt. Miss Reid is a total stranger to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He did not reflect that she was his aunt. He knew only that she was a\nbeautiful and defenceless woman of obviously good family and he acted as\nany gentleman would have done. You are young, handsome, Aryan to the\ntips of your fingers, the honour of Germany is in your hands.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very good, sir. I will do my best.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat night there was another knock on Miss Reid's door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The radio-operator. I have a radio for you, Miss Reid.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For me?\" She was surprised, but it at once occurred to her that one of\nher fellow-passengers who had got off at Haiti had sent her New Year's\ngreetings. \"How very kind people are,\" she thought. \"I'm in bed. Leave\nit outside the door.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It needs an answer. Ten words prepaid.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen it couldn't be a New Year's greeting. Her heart stopped beating. It\ncould only mean one thing; her shop had been burned to the ground. She\njumped out of bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Slip it under the door and I'll write the answer and slip it back to\nyou.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe envelope was pushed under the door and as it appeared on the carpet\nit had really a sinister look. Miss Reid snatched it up and tore the\nenvelope open. The words swam before her eyes and she couldn't for a\nmoment find her spectacles. This is what she read:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Happy New Year. Stop. Peace and goodwill to all men. Stop. You are very\nbeautiful. Stop. I love you. Stop. I must speak to you. Stop. Signed:\nRadio Operator.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Reid read this through twice. Then she slowly took off her\nspectacles and hid them under a scarf. She opened the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come in,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext day was New Year's Eve. The officers were cheerful and a little\nsentimental when they sat down to dinner. The stewards had decorated the\nsaloon with tropical creepers to make up for holly and mistletoe, and\nthe Christmas tree stood on a table with the candles ready to be lit at\nsupper time. Miss Reid did not come in till the officers were seated,\nand when they bade her good-morning she did not speak but merely bowed.\nThey looked at her curiously. She ate a good dinner, but uttered never a\nword. Her silence was uncanny. At last the captain could stand it no\nlonger, and he said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're very quiet to-day, Miss Reid.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm thinking,\" she remarked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And will you not tell us your thoughts, Miss Reid?\" the doctor asked\nplayfully.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a cool, you might almost have called it a supercilious,\nlook.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I prefer to keep them to myself, Doctor. I will have a little more of\nthat hash, I've got a very good appetite.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey finished the meal in a blessed silence. The captain heaved a sigh\nof relief. That was what meal-time was for, to eat, not to chatter. When\nthey had finished he went up to the doctor and wrung his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Something has happened, Doctor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It has happened. She's a changed woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But will it last?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One can only hope for the best.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Reid put on an evening dress for the evening's celebration, a very\nquiet black dress, with artificial roses at her bosom and a long string\nof imitation jade round her neck. The lights were dimmed and the candles\non the Christmas tree were lit. It felt a little like being in church.\nThe junior officers were supping in the saloon that evening and they\nlooked very smart in their white uniforms. Champagne was served at the\ncompany's expense and after supper they had a <i>Maibowle</i>. They pulled\ncrackers. They sang songs to the gramophone, <i>Deutschland</i>, <i>Deutschland\nüber Alles</i>, <i>Alt Heidelberg</i> and <i>Auld Lang Syne</i>. They shouted out the\ntunes lustily, the captain's voice rising loud above the others, and\nMiss Reid joining in with a pleasing contralto. The doctor noticed that\nMiss Reid's eyes from time to time rested on the radio-operator, and in\nthem he read an expression of some bewilderment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's a good-looking fellow, isn't he?\" said the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Reid turned round and looked at the doctor coolly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The radio-operator. I thought you were looking at him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Which is he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The duplicity of women,\" the doctor muttered, but with a smile he\nanswered: \"He's sitting next to the chief engineer.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, of course, I recognise him now. You know, I never think it matters\nwhat a man looks like. I'm so much more interested in a man's brains\nthan in his looks.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ah,\" said the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey all got a little tight, including Miss Reid, but she did not lose\nher dignity and when she bade them good-night it was in her best manner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've had a very delightful evening. I shall never forget my New Year's\nEve on a German boat. It's been very interesting. Quite an experience.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe walked steadily to the door, and this was something of a triumph,\nfor she had drunk drink for drink with the rest of them through the\nevening.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were all somewhat jaded next day. When the captain, the mate, the\ndoctor and the chief engineer came down to dinner they found Miss Reid\nalready seated. Before each place was a small parcel tied up in pink\nribbon. On each was written: Happy New Year. They gave Miss Reid a\nquestioning glance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've all been so very kind to me I thought I'd like to give each of\nyou a little present. There wasn't much choice at Port au Prince, so you\nmustn't expect too much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was pair of briar pipes for the captain, half a dozen silk\nhandkerchiefs for the doctor, a cigar-case for the mate and a couple of\nties for the chief engineer. They had dinner and Miss Reid retired to\nher cabin to rest. The officers looked at one another uncomfortably. The\nmate fiddled with the cigar-case she had given him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm a little ashamed of myself,\" he said at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe captain was pensive and it was plain that he too was a trifle\nuneasy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder if we ought to have played that trick on Miss Reid,\" he said.\n\"She's a good old soul and she's not rich; she's a woman who earns her\nown living. She must have spent the best part of a hundred marks on\nthese presents. I almost wish we'd left her alone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You wanted her silenced and I've silenced her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When all's said and done, it wouldn't have hurt us to listen to her\nchatter for three weeks more,\" said the mate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not happy about her,\" added the captain. \"I feel there's something\nominous in her quietness.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe had spoken hardly a word during the meal they had just shared with\nher. She seemed hardly to listen to what they said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you think you ought to ask her if she's feeling quite well,\ndoctor?\" suggested the captain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course she's feeling quite well. She's eating like a wolf. If you\nwant inquiries made you'd much better make them of the radio-operator.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You may not be aware of it, Doctor, but I am a man of great delicacy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am a man of heart myself,\" said the doctor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor the rest of the journey those men spoilt Miss Reid outrageously.\nThey treated her with the consideration they would have shown to someone\nwho was convalescent after a long and dangerous illness. Though her\nappetite was excellent they sought to tempt her with new dishes. The\ndoctor ordered wine and insisted on her sharing his bottle with him.\nThey played dominoes with her. They played chess with her. They played\nbridge with her. They engaged her in conversation. But there was no\ndoubt about it, though she responded to their advances with politeness,\nshe kept herself to herself. She seemed to regard them with something\nvery like disdain; you might almost have thought that she looked upon\nthose men and their efforts to be amiable as pleasantly ridiculous. She\nseldom spoke unless spoken to. She read detective stories and at night\nsat on deck looking at the stars. She lived a life of her own.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last the journey drew to its close. They sailed up the English\nChannel on a still grey day; they sighted land. Miss Reid packed her\ntrunk. At two o'clock in the afternoon they docked at Plymouth. The\ncaptain, the mate and the doctor came along to say good-bye to her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, Miss Reid,\" said the captain in his jovial way, \"we're sorry to\nlose you, but I suppose you're glad to be getting home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've been very kind to me, you've all been very kind to me, I don't\nknow what I've done to deserve it. I've been very happy with you. I\nshall never forget you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe spoke rather shakily, she tried to smile, but her lips quivered, and\ntears ran down her cheeks. The captain got very red. He smiled\nawkwardly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"May I kiss you, Miss Reid?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was taller than he by half a head. She bent down and he planted a\nfat kiss on one wet cheek and a fat kiss on the other. She turned to the\nmate and the doctor. They both kissed her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What an old fool I am,\" she said. \"Everybody's so good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe dried her eyes and slowly, in her graceful, rather absurd way,\nwalked down the companion. The captain's eyes were wet. When she reached\nthe quay she looked up and waved to someone on the boat deck.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who's she waving to?\" asked the captain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The radio-operator.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMiss Price was waiting on the quay to welcome her. When they had passed\nthe Customs and got rid of Miss Reid's heavy luggage they went to Miss\nPrice's house and had an early cup of tea. Miss Reid's train did not\nstart till five. Miss Price had much to tell Miss Reid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But it's too bad of me to go on like this when you've just come home.\nI've been looking forward to hearing all about your journey.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid there's not very much to tell.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't believe that. Your trip was a success, wasn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A distinct success.

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI was at Pagan, in Burma, and from there I took the steamer to Mandalay,\nbut a couple of days before I got there, when the boat tied up for the\nnight at a riverside village, I made up my mind to go ashore. The\nskipper told me that there was there a pleasant little club in which I\nhad only to make myself at home; they were quite used to having\nstrangers drop off like that from the steamer, and the secretary was a\nvery decent chap; I might even get a game of bridge. I had nothing in\nthe world to do, so I got into one of the bullock-carts that were\nwaiting at the landing-stage and was driven to the club. There was a man\nsitting on the verandah and as I walked up he nodded to me and asked\nwhether I would have a whisky and soda or a gin and bitters. The\npossibility that I would have nothing at all did not even occur to him.\nI chose the longer drink and sat down. He was a tall, thin, bronzed man,\nwith a big moustache, and he wore khaki shorts and a khaki shirt. I\nnever knew his name, but when we had been chatting a little while\nanother man came in who told me he was the secretary, and he addressed\nmy friend as George.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you heard from your wife yet?\" he asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe other's eyes brightened.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I had letters by this mail. She's having no end of a time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did she tell you not to fret?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge gave a little chuckle, but was I mistaken in thinking that there\nwas in it the shadow of a sob?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In point of fact she did. But that's easier said than done. Of course I\nknow she wants a holiday, and I'm glad she should have it, but it's\ndevilish hard on a chap.\" He turned to me. \"You see, this is the first\ntime I've ever been separated from my missus, and I'm like a lost dog\nwithout her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How long have you been married?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Five minutes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe secretary of the club laughed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be a fool, George. You've been married eight years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter we had talked for a little, George, looking at his watch, said he\nmust go and change his clothes for dinner and left us. The secretary\nwatched him disappear into the night with a smile of not unkindly irony.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We all ask him as much as we can now that he's alone,\" he told me. \"He\nmopes so terribly since his wife went home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must be very pleasant for her to know that her husband is as devoted\nto her as all that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mabel is a remarkable woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe called the boy and ordered more drinks. In this hospitable place they\ndid not ask you if you would have anything; they took it for granted.\nThen he settled himself in his long chair and lit a cheroot. He told me\nthe story of George and Mabel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey became engaged when he was home on leave, and when he returned to\nBurma it was arranged that she should join him in six months. But one\ndifficulty cropped up after another; Mabel's father died, the war came,\nGeorge was sent to a district unsuitable for a white woman; so that in\nthe end it was seven years before she was able to start. He made all\narrangements for the marriage, which was to take place on the day of her\narrival, and went down to Rangoon to meet her. On the morning on which\nthe ship was due he borrowed a motor-car and drove along to the dock. He\npaced the quay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen, suddenly, without warning, his nerve failed him. He had not seen\nMabel for seven years. He had forgotten what she was like. She was a\ntotal stranger. He felt a terrible sinking in the pit of his stomach and\nhis knees began to wobble. He couldn't go through with it. He must tell\nMabel that he was very sorry, but he couldn't, he really couldn't marry\nher. But how could a man tell a girl a thing like that when she had been\nengaged to him for seven years and had come six thousand miles to marry\nhim? He hadn't the nerve for that either. George was seized with the\ncourage of despair. There was a boat at the quay on the very point of\nstarting for Singapore; he wrote a hurried letter to Mabel, and without\na stick of luggage, just in the clothes he stood up in, leaped on board.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe letter Mabel received ran somewhat as follows:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<i>Dearest Mabel, I have been suddenly called away on business and do not\nknow when I shall be back. I think it would be much wiser if you\nreturned to England. My plans are very uncertain. Your loving George.</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut when he arrived at Singapore he found a cable waiting for him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<i>Quite understand. Don't worry. Love. Mabel.</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTerror made him quick-witted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By Jove, I believe she's following me,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe telegraphed to the shipping-office at Rangoon and sure enough her\nname was on the passenger list of the ship that was now on its way to\nSingapore. There was not a moment to lose. He jumped on the train to\nBangkok. But he was uneasy; she would have no difficulty in finding out\nthat he had gone to Bangkok and it was just as simple for her to take\nthe train as it had been for him. Fortunately there was a French tramp\nsailing next day for Saigon. He took it. At Saigon he would be safe; it\nwould never occur to her that he had gone there; and if it did, surely\nby now she would have taken the hint. It is five days journey from\nBangkok to Saigon and the boat is dirty, cramped and uncomfortable. He\nwas glad to arrive and took a rickshaw to the hotel. He signed his name\nin the visitors' book and a telegram was immediately handed to him. It\ncontained but two words: <i>Love. Mabel.</i> They were enough to make him\nbreak into a cold sweat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When is the next boat for Hong-Kong?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow his flight grew serious. He sailed to Hong-Kong, but dared not stay\nthere; he went to Manila; Manila was ominous; he went on to Shanghai:\nShanghai was nerve-racking; every time he went out of the hotel he\nexpected to run straight into Mabel's arms; no, Shanghai would never do.\nThe only thing was to go to Yokohama. At the Grand Hotel at Yokohama a\ncable awaited him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>So sorry to have missed you at Manila. Love. Mabel.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe scanned the shipping intelligence with a fevered brow. Where was she\nnow? He doubled back to Shanghai. This time he went straight to the club\nand asked for a telegram. It was handed to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Arriving shortly. Love. Mabel.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNo, no, he was not so easy to catch as all that. He had already made his\nplans. The Yangtse is a long river and the Yangtse was falling. He could\njust about catch the last steamer that could get up to Chungking and\nthen no one could travel till the following spring except by junk. Such\na journey was out of the question for a woman alone. He went to Hankow\nand from Hankow to Ichang, he changed boats here and from Ichang through\nthe rapids went to Chungking. But he was desperate now, he was not going\nto take any risks: there was a place called Cheng-tu, the capital of\nSzechuan, and it was four hundred miles away. It could only be reached\nby road, and the road was infested with brigands. A man would be safe\nthere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge collected chair-bearers and coolies and set out. It was with a\nsigh of relief that he saw at last the crenellated walls of the lonely\nChinese city. From those walls at sunset you could see the snowy\nmountains of Tibet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe could rest at last: Mabel would never find him there. The consul\nhappened to be a friend of his and he stayed with him. He enjoyed the\ncomfort of a luxurious house, he enjoyed his idleness after that\nstrenuous escape across Asia, and above all he enjoyed his divine\nsecurity. The weeks passed lazily one after the other.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne morning George and the consul were in the courtyard looking at some\ncurios that a Chinese had brought for their inspection when there was a\nloud knocking at the great door of the Consulate. The door-man flung it\nopen. A chair borne by four coolies entered, advanced, and was set down.\nMabel stepped out. She was neat and cool and fresh. There was nothing in\nher appearance to suggest that she had just come in after a fortnight on\nthe road. George was petrified. He was as pale as death. She went up to\nhim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa, George, I was so afraid I'd missed you again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa, Mabel,\" he faltered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not know what to say. He looked this way and that: she stood\nbetween him and the doorway. She looked at him with a smile in her blue\neyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You haven't altered at all,\" she said. \"Men can go off so dreadfully in\nseven years and I was afraid you'd got fat and bald. I've been so\nnervous. It would have been terrible if after all these years I simply\nhadn't been able to bring myself to marry you after all.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe turned to George's host.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you the consul?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's all right. I'm ready to marry him as soon as I've had a bath.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd she did.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nWhen I left Colombo I had no notion of going to Keng Tung, but on the\nship I met a man who told me he had spent five years there. He said it\nhad an important market, held every five days, whither came natives of\nhalf a dozen countries and members of half a hundred tribes. It had\npagodas darkly splendid and a remoteness that liberated the questing\nspirit from its anxiety. He said he would sooner live there than\nanywhere in the world. I asked him what it had offered him and he said,\ncontentment. He was a tall, dark fellow with the aloofness of manner you\noften find in those who have lived much alone in unfrequented places.\nMen like this are a little restless in the company of others and though\nin the smoking-room of a ship or at the club bar they may be talkative\nand convivial, telling their story with the rest, joking and glad\nsometimes to narrate their unusual experiences, they seem always to hold\nsomething back. They have a life in themselves that they keep apart, and\nthere is a look in their eyes, as it were turned inwards, that informs\nyou that this hidden life is the only one that signifies to them. And\nnow and then their eyes betray their weariness with the social round\ninto which hazard or the fear of seeming odd has for a moment forced\nthem. They seem then to long for the monotonous solitude of some place\nof their predilection where they can be once more alone with the reality\nthey have found.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was as much the manner of this chance acquaintance as what he told me\nthat persuaded me to make the journey across the Shan States on which I\nnow set out. From the rail-head in Upper Burma to the rail-head in Siam,\nwhence I could get down to Bangkok, it was between six and seven hundred\nmiles. Kind people had done everything possible to render the excursion\neasy for me and the Resident at Taunggyi had wired to me that he had\nmade arrangements for mules and ponies to be ready for me on my arrival.\nI had bought in Rangoon such stores as seemed necessary, folding chairs\nand a table, a filter, lamps and I know not what. I took the train from\nMandalay to Thazi, intending there to hire a car for Taunggyi, and a man\nI had met at the club at Mandalay and who lived at Thazi asked me to\nhave brunch (the pleasant meal of Burma that combines breakfast and\nlunch) with him before I started. His name was Masterson. He was a man\nin the early thirties, with a pleasant friendly face, curling dark hair\nspeckled with grey, and handsome dark eyes. He spoke with a singularly\nmusical voice, very slowly, and this, I hardly know why, inspired you\nwith confidence. You felt that a man who took such a long time to say\nwhat he had to say and had found the world with sufficient leisure to\nlisten to him must have qualities that made him sympathetic to his\nfellows. He took the amiability of mankind for granted and I suppose he\ncould only have done this because he was himself amiable. He had a nice\nsense of humour, without of course a quick thrust and parry, but\nagreeably sarcastic; it was of that agreeable type that applies common\nsense to the accidents of life and so sees them in a faintly ridiculous\naspect. He was engaged in a business that kept him travelling up and\ndown Burma most of the year and in his journeyings he had acquired the\ncollector's habit. He told me that he spent all his spare money on\nbuying Burmese curiosities and it was especially to see them that he\nasked me to have a meal with him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe train got in early in the morning. He had warned me that, having to\nbe at his office, he could not meet me; but brunch was at ten and he\ntold me to go to his house as soon as I was finished with the one or two\nthings I had to do in the town.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Make yourself at home,\" he said, \"and if you want a drink ask the boy\nfor it. I'll get back as soon as I've got through with my business.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI found out where there was a garage and made a bargain with the owner\nof a very dilapidated Ford to take me and my baggage to Taunggyi. I left\nmy Madrassi servant to see that everything was stowed in it that was\npossible and the rest tied on to the foot-boards, and strolled along to\nMasterson's house. It was a neat little bungalow in a road shaded by\ntall trees, and in the early light of a sunny day looked pretty and\nhomelike. I walked up the steps and was hailed by Masterson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I got done more quickly than I expected. I shall have time to show you\nmy things before brunch is ready. What will you have? I'm afraid I can\nonly offer you a whisky and soda.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Isn't it rather early for that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Rather. But it's one of the rules of the house that nobody crosses the\nthreshold without having a drink.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What can I do but submit to the rule?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe called the boy and in a moment a trim Burmese brought in a decanter,\na syphon and glasses. I sat down and looked about the room. Though it\nwas still so early the sun was hot outside and the jalousies were drawn.\nThe light was pleasant and cool after the glare of the road. The room\nwas comfortably furnished with rattan chairs and on the walls were\nwater-colour paintings of English scenes. They were a little prim and\nold-fashioned and I guessed that they had been painted in her youth by\nthe maiden and elderly aunt of my host. There were two of a cathedral I\ndid not know, two or three of a rose garden and one of a Georgian house.\nWhen he saw my eyes for an instant rest upon this, he said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That was our house at Cheltenham.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, is that where you come from?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen there was his collection. The room was crowded with Buddhas and\nwith figures, in bronze or wood, of the Buddha's disciples; there were\nboxes of all shapes, utensils of one kind and another, curiosities of\nevery sort, and although there were far too many they were arranged with\na certain taste so that the effect was pleasing. He had some lovely\nthings. He showed them to me with pride, telling me how he had got this\nobject and that, and how he had heard of another and hunted it down and\nthe incredible astuteness he had employed to induce an unwilling owner\nto part with it. His kindly eyes shone when he described a great bargain\nand they flashed darkly when he inveighed against the unreasonableness\nof a vendor who rather than accept a fair price for a bronze dish had\ntaken it away. There were flowers in the room, and it had not the\nforlorn look that so many bachelors' houses have in the East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You've made the place very comfortable,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave the room a sweeping glance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It <i>was</i> all right. It's not much now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not quite know what he meant. Then he showed me a long wooden gilt\nbox, decorated with the glass mosaic that I had admired in the palace at\nMandalay, but the workmanship was more delicate than anything I had seen\nthere, and this with its gem-like richness had really something of the\nornate exquisiteness of the Italian Renaissance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They tell me it's about a couple of hundred years old,\" he said.\n\"They've not been able to turn out anything like this for a long time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a piece made obviously for a king's palace and you wondered to\nwhat uses it had been put and what hands it had passed through. It was a\njewel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is the inside like?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, nothing much. It's just lacquered.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe opened it and I saw that it contained three or four framed\nphotographs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I'd forgotten those were there,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis soft, musical voice had a queer sound in it, and I gave him a\nsidelong look. He was bronzed by the sun, but his face notwithstanding\nflushed a deeper red. He was about to close the box, and then he changed\nhis mind. He took out one of the photographs and showed it to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Some of these Burmese girls are rather sweet when they're young, aren't\nthey?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe photograph showed a young girl standing somewhat self-consciously\nagainst the conventional background of a photographer's studio, a pagoda\nand a group of palm trees. She was wearing her best clothes and she had\na flower in her hair. But the embarrassment you saw she felt at having\nher picture taken did not prevent a shy smile from trembling on her lips\nand her large solemn eyes had nevertheless a roguish twinkle. She was\nvery small and very slender.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What a ravishing little thing,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen Masterson took out another photograph in which she sat with a child\nstanding by her side, his hand timidly on her knee and a baby in her\narms. The child stared straight in front of him with a look of terror on\nhis face; he could not understand what that machine and the man behind\nit, his head under a black cloth, were up to.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are those her children?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And mine,\" said Masterson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment the boy came in to say that brunch was ready. We went\ninto the dining-room and sat down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what you'll get to eat. Since my girl went away everything\nin the house has gone to blazes.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA sulky look came into his red honest face and I did not know what to\nreply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm so hungry that whatever I get will seem good,\" I hazarded.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not say anything and a plate of thin porridge was put before us.\nI helped myself to milk and sugar, Masterson ate a spoonful or two and\npushed his plate aside.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish I hadn't looked at those damned photographs,\" he said. \"I put\nthem away on purpose.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did not want to be inquisitive or to force a confidence my host had no\nwish to give, but neither did I desire to seem so unconcerned as to\nprevent him from telling me something he had in his heart. Often in some\nlonely post in the jungle or in a stiff grand house, solitary in the\nmidst of a teeming Chinese city, a man has told me stories about himself\nthat I was sure he had never told to a living soul. I was a stray\nacquaintance whom he had never seen before and would never see again, a\nwanderer for a moment through his monotonous life, and some starved\nimpulse led him to lay bare his soul. I have in this way learned more\nabout men in a night (sitting over a syphon or two and a bottle of\nwhisky, the hostile, inexplicable world outside the radius of an\nacetylene lamp) than I could have if I had known them for ten years. If\nyou are interested in human nature it is one of the great pleasures of\ntravel. And when you separate (for you have to be up betimes) sometimes\nthey will say to you:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I've bored you to death with all this nonsense. I haven't\ntalked so much for six months. But it's done me good to get it off my\nchest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe boy removed the porridge plates and gave each of us a piece of pale\nfried fish. It was rather cold.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The fish is beastly, isn't it?\" said Masterson. \"I hate river fish,\nexcept trout; the only thing is to smother it with Worcester sauce.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe helped himself freely and passed me the bottle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was a damned good housekeeper, my girl; I used to feed like a\nfighting-cock when she was here. She'd have had the cook out of the\nhouse in a quarter of an hour if he'd sent in muck like this.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave me a smile, and I noticed that his smile was very sweet. It gave\nhim a peculiarly gentle look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was rather a wrench parting with her, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was quite evident now that he wished to talk and I had no hesitation\nin giving him a lead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you have a row?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. You could hardly call it a row. She lived with me five years and we\nnever had a tiff even. She was the best-tempered little thing that ever\nwas. Nothing seemed to put her out. She was always as merry as a\ncricket. You couldn't look at her without her lips breaking into a\nsmile. She was always happy. And there was no reason why she shouldn't\nbe. I was very good to her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sure you were,\" I answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was mistress here. I gave her everything she wanted. Perhaps if I'd\nbeen more of a brute she wouldn't have gone away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't make me say anything so obvious as that women are incalculable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave me a deprecating glance and there was a trace of shyness in the\nsmile that just flickered in his eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would it bore you awfully if I told you about it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I saw her one day in the street and she rather took my fancy. I\nshowed you her photograph, but the photograph doesn't begin to do her\njustice. It sounds silly to say about a Burmese girl, but she was like a\nrose-bud, not an English rose, you know, she was as little like that as\nthe glass flowers on that box I showed you are like real flowers, but a\nrose grown in an Eastern garden that had something strange and exotic\nabout it. I don't know how to make myself plain.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I understand what you mean all the same,\" I smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I saw her two or three times and found out where she lived. I sent my\nboy to make enquiries about her, and he told me that her parents were\nquite willing that I should have her if we could come to an arrangement.\nI wasn't inclined to haggle and everything was settled in no time. Her\nfamily gave a party to celebrate the occasion and she came to live here.\nOf course I treated her in every way as my wife and put her in charge of\nthe house. I told the boys that they'd got to take their orders from her\nand if she complained of any of them out they went. You know, some\nfellows keep their girls in the servants' quarters and when they go away\non tour the girls have a rotten time. Well, I think that's a filthy\nthing to do. If you are going to have a girl to live with you the least\nyou can do is to see that she has a good time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She was a great success and I was as pleased as Punch. She kept the\nhouse spotless. She saved me money. She wouldn't let the boys rob me. I\ntaught her to play bridge and, believe me, she learned to play a damned\ngood game.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did she like it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Loved it. When people came here she couldn't have received them better\nif she'd been a duchess. You know, these Burmese have beautiful manners.\nSometimes it would make me laugh to see the assurance with which she\nwould receive my guests, government officials, you know, and soldiers\nwho were passing through. If some young subaltern was rather shy she'd\nput him at his ease at once. She was never pushing or obtrusive, but\njust there when she was wanted and doing her best to see that everything\nwent well and everyone had a good time. And I'll tell you what, she\ncould mix the best cocktail you'd get anywhere between Rangoon and\nBhamo. People used to say I was lucky.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm bound to say I think you were,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe curry was served and I piled my plate with rice and helped myself to\nchicken and then chose from a dozen little dishes the condiments I\nfancied. It was a good curry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then she had her babies, three in three years, but one died when it was\nsix weeks old. I showed you a photograph of the two that are living.\nFunny-looking little things, aren't they? Are you fond of children?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. I have a strange and almost unnatural passion for new-born\nbabies.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think I am, you know. I couldn't even feel very much about my\nown. I've often wondered if it showed that I was rather a rotter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think so. I think the passion many people affect for children\nis merely a fashionable pose. I have a notion that children are all the\nbetter for not being burdened with too much parental love.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then my girl asked me to marry her, legally I mean, in the English way.\nI treated it as a joke. I didn't know how she'd got such an idea in her\nhead. I thought it was only a whim and I gave her a gold bracelet to\nkeep her quiet. But it wasn't a whim. She was quite serious about it. I\ntold her there was nothing doing. But you know what women are, when they\nonce set their mind on getting something they never give you a moment's\npeace. She wheedled and sulked, she cried, she appealed to my\ncompassion, she tried to extract a promise out of me when I was rather\ntight, she was on the watch for me when I was feeling amorous, she\nnearly tripped me when she was ill. She watched me more carefully, I\nshould think, than a stockbroker ever watched the market, and I knew\nthat, however natural she seemed, however occupied with something else,\nshe was always warily alert for the unguarded moment when she could\npounce on me and gain her point.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMasterson gave me once more his slow, ingenuous smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose women are pretty much the same all the world over,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I expect so,\" I answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A thing I've never been able to understand is why a woman thinks it\nworth while to make you do something you don't want to. She'd rather you\ndid a thing against the grain than not do it at all. I don't see what\nsatisfaction it can be to them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The satisfaction of triumph. A man convinced against his will may be of\nthe same opinion still, but a woman doesn't mind that. She has\nconquered. She has proved her power.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMasterson shrugged his shoulders. He drank a cup of tea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see, she said that sooner or later I was bound to marry an English\ngirl and turn her out. I said I wasn't thinking of marrying. She said\nshe knew all about that. And even if I didn't I should retire some day\nand go back to England. And where would she be then? It went on for a\nyear. I held out. Then she said that if I wouldn't marry her she'd go\nand take the kids with her. I told her not to be a silly little fool.\nShe said that if she left me now she could marry a Burman, but in a few\nyears nobody would want her. She began to pack her things. I thought it\nwas only a bluff and I called it: I said: 'Well, go if you want to, but\nif you do you won't come back.' I didn't think she'd give up a house\nlike this, and the presents I made her, and all the pickings, to go back\nto her own family. They were as poor as church mice. Well, she went on\npacking her things. She was just as nice as ever to me, she was gay and\nsmiling; when some fellows came to spend the night here she was just as\ncordial as usual, and she played bridge with us till two in the morning.\nI couldn't believe she meant to go and yet I was rather scared. I was\nvery fond of her. She was a damned good sort.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But if you were fond of her why on earth didn't you marry her? It had\nbeen a great success.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll tell you. If I married her I'd have to stay in Burma for the rest\nof my life. Sooner or later I shall retire and then I want to go back to\nmy old home and live there. I don't want to be buried out here, I want\nto be buried in an English churchyard. I'm happy enough here, but I\ndon't want to live here always. I couldn't. I want England. Sometimes I\nget sick of this hot sunshine and these garish colours. I want grey\nskies and a soft rain falling and the smell of the country. I shall be a\nfunny fat elderly man when I go back, too old to hunt even if I could\nafford it, but I can fish. I don't want to shoot tigers, I want to shoot\nrabbits. And I can play golf on a proper course. I know I shall be out\nof it, we fellows who've spent our lives out here always are, but I can\npotter about the local club and talk to retired Anglo-Indians. I want to\nfeel under my feet the grey pavement of an English country town, I want\nto be able to go and have a row with the butcher because the steak he\nsent me in yesterday was tough, and I want to browse about second-hand\nbookshops. I want to be said how d'you do to in the street by people who\nknew me when I was a boy. And I want to have a walled garden at the back\nof my house and grow roses. I dare say it all sounds very humdrum and\nprovincial and dull to you, but that's the sort of life my people have\nalways lived and that's the sort of life I want to live myself. It's a\ndream if you like, but it's all I have, it means everything in the world\nto me, and I can't give it up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe paused for a moment and looked into my eyes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think me an awful fool?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then one morning she came to me and said that she was off. She had her\nthings put on a cart and even then I didn't think she meant it. Then she\nput the two children in a rickshaw and came to say good-bye to me. She\nbegan to cry. By George, that pretty well broke me up. I asked her if\nshe really meant to go and she said yes, unless I married her. I shook\nmy head. I very nearly yielded. I'm afraid I was crying too. Then she\ngave a great sob and ran out of the house. I had to drink about half a\ntumbler of whisky to steady my nerves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How long ago did this happen?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Four months. At first I thought she'd come back and then because I\nthought she was ashamed to make the first step I sent my boy to tell her\nthat if she wanted to come I'd take her. But she refused. The house\nseemed awfully empty without her. At first I thought I'd get used to it,\nbut somehow it doesn't seem to get any less empty. I didn't know how\nmuch she meant to me. She'd twined herself round my heart.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose she'll come back if you agree to marry her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, yes, she told the boy that. Sometimes I ask myself if it's worth\nwhile to sacrifice my happiness for a dream. It is only a dream, isn't\nit? It's funny, one of the things that holds me back is the thought of a\nmuddy lane I know, with great clay banks on both sides of it, and above,\nbeech trees bending over. It's got a sort of cold, earthy smell that I\ncan never quite get out of my nostrils. I don't blame her, you know. I\nrather admire her. I had no idea she had so much character. Sometimes\nI'm awfully inclined to give way.\" He hesitated for a little while. \"I\nthink, perhaps, if I thought she loved me I would. But of course, she\ndoesn't; they never do, these girls who go and live with white men, I\nthink she liked me, but that's all. What would you do in my place?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, my dear fellow, how can I tell? Would you ever forget that dream?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment the boy came in to say that my Madrassi servant with the\nFord car had just come up. Masterson looked at his watch.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll want to be getting off, won't you? And I must get back to my\noffice. I'm afraid I've rather bored you with my domestic affairs.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not at all,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe shook hands, I put on my topee, and he waved to me as the car drove\noff.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nFirst the King of Siam had two daughters and he called them Night and\nDay. Then he had two more, so he changed the names of the first ones and\ncalled the four of them after the seasons, Spring and Autumn, Winter and\nSummer. But in course of time he had three others and he changed their\nnames again and called all seven by the days of the week. But when his\neighth daughter was born he did not know what to do till he suddenly\nthought of the months of the year. The Queen said there were only twelve\nand it confused her to have to remember so many new names, but the King\nhad a methodical mind and when he made it up he never could change it if\nhe tried. He changed the names of all his daughters and called them\nJanuary, February, March (though of course in Siamese) till he came to\nthe youngest, who was called August, and the next one was called\nSeptember.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That only leaves October, November, and December,\" said the Queen. \"And\nafter that we shall have to begin all over again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, we shan't,\" said the King, \"because I think twelve daughters are\nenough for any man and after the birth of dear little December I shall\nbe reluctantly compelled to cut off your head.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe cried bitterly when he said this, for he was extremely fond of the\nQueen. Of course it made the Queen very uneasy because she knew that it\nwould distress the King very much if he had to cut off her head. And it\nwould not be very nice for her. But it so happened that there was no\nneed for either of them to worry because September was the last daughter\nthey ever had. The Queen only had sons after that and they were called\nby the letters of the alphabet, so there was no cause for anxiety there\nfor a long time, since she had only reached the letter J.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow the King of Siam's daughters had had their characters permanently\nembittered by having to change their names in this way, and the older\nones, whose names of course had been changed oftener than the others,\nhad their characters more permanently embittered. But September, who had\nnever known what it was to be called anything but September (except of\ncourse by her sisters, who because their characters were embittered\ncalled her all sorts of names), had a very sweet and charming nature.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe King of Siam had a habit which I think might be usefully imitated in\nEurope. Instead of receiving presents on his birthday he gave them and\nit looks as though he liked it, for he used often to say he was sorry he\nhad only been born on one day and so only had one birthday in the year.\nBut in this way he managed in course of time to give away all his\nwedding presents and the loyal addresses which the mayors of the cities\nin Siam presented him with and all his own crowns which had gone out of\nfashion. One year on his birthday, not having anything else handy, he\ngave each of his daughters a beautiful green parrot in a beautiful\ngolden cage. There were nine of them and on each cage was written the\nname of the month which was the name of the princess it belonged to. The\nnine princesses were very proud of their parrots and they spent an hour\nevery day (for like their father they were of a methodical turn of mind)\nin teaching them to talk. Presently all the parrots could say God Save\nthe King (in Siamese, which is very difficult) and some of them could\nsay Pretty Polly in no less than seven oriental languages. But one day\nwhen the Princess September went to say good-morning to her parrot she\nfound it lying dead at the bottom of its golden cage. She burst into a\nflood of tears, and nothing that her Maids of Honour could say comforted\nher. She cried so much that the Maids of Honour, not knowing what to do,\ntold the Queen, and the Queen said it was stuff and nonsense and the\nchild had better go to bed without any supper. The Maids of Honour\nwanted to go to a party, so they put the Princess September to bed as\nquickly as they could and left her by herself. And while she lay in her\nbed, crying still even though she felt rather hungry, she saw a little\nbird hop into her room. She took her thumb out of her mouth and sat up.\nThen the little bird began to sing and he sang a beautiful song all\nabout the lake in the King's garden and the willow trees that looked at\nthemselves in the still water and the goldfish that glided in and out of\nthe branches that were reflected in it. When he had finished, the\nPrincess was not crying any more and she quite forgot that she had had\nno supper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That was a very nice song,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe little bird gave her a bow, for artists have naturally good manners,\nand they like to be appreciated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would you care to have me instead of your parrot?\" said the little\nbird. \"It's true that I'm not so pretty to look at, but on the other\nhand I have a much better voice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Princess September clapped her hands with delight and then the\nlittle bird hopped on to the end of her bed and sang her to sleep.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen she awoke next day the little bird was still sitting there, and as\nshe opened her eyes he said good-morning. The Maids of Honour brought in\nher breakfast, and he ate rice out of her hand and he had his bath in\nher saucer. He drank out of it too. The Maids of Honour said they didn't\nthink it was very polite to drink one's bath water, but the Princess\nSeptember said that was the artistic temperament. When he had finished\nhis breakfast he began to sing again so beautifully that the Maids of\nHonour were quite surprised, for they had never heard anything like it,\nand the Princess September was very proud and happy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now I want to show you to my eight sisters,\" said the Princess.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe stretched out the first finger of her right hand so that it served\nas a perch and the little bird flew down and sat on it. Then, followed\nby her Maids of Honour, she went through the palace and called on each\nof the Princesses in turn, starting with January, for she was mindful of\netiquette, and going all the way down to August. And for each of the\nPrincesses the little bird sang a different song. But the parrots could\nonly say God Save the King and Pretty Polly. At last she showed the\nlittle bird to the King and Queen. They were surprised and delighted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I knew I was right to send you to bed without any supper,\" said the\nQueen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This bird sings much better than the parrots,\" said the King.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have thought you got quite tired of hearing people say God\nSave the King,\" said the Queen. \"I can't think why those girls wanted to\nteach their parrots to say it too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The sentiment is admirable,\" said the King, \"and I never mind how often\nI hear it. But I do get tired of hearing those parrots say Pretty\nPolly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They say it in seven different languages,\" said the Princesses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say they do,\" said the King, \"but it reminds me too much of my\ncouncillors. They say the same thing in seven different ways and it\nnever means anything in any way they say it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Princesses, their characters as I have already said being naturally\nembittered, were vexed at this, and the parrots looked very glum indeed.\nBut the Princess September ran through all the rooms of the palace,\nsinging like a lark, while the little bird flew round and round her,\nsinging like a nightingale, which indeed it was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThings went on like this for several days and then the eight Princesses\nput their heads together. They went to September and sat down in a\ncircle round her, hiding their feet as is proper for Siamese princesses\nto do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My poor September,\" they said. \"We are sorry for the death of your\nbeautiful parrot. It must be dreadful for you not to have a pet bird as\nwe have. So we have all put our pocket-money together and we are going\nto buy you a lovely green and yellow parrot.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thank you for nothing,\" said September. (This was not very civil of\nher, but Siamese princesses are sometimes a little short with one\nanother.) \"I have a pet bird which sings the most charming songs to me\nand I don't know what on earth I should do with a green and yellow\nparrot.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJanuary sniffed, then February sniffed, then March sniffed; in fact all\nthe Princesses sniffed, but in their proper order of precedence. When\nthey had finished September asked them:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why do you sniff? Have you all got colds in the head?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, my dear,\" they said, \"it's absurd to talk of your bird when the\nlittle fellow flies in and out just as he likes.\" They looked round the\nroom and raised their eyebrows so high that their foreheads entirely\ndisappeared.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll get dreadful wrinkles,\" said September.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you mind our asking where your bird is now?\" they said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's gone to pay a visit to his father-in-law,\" said the Princess\nSeptember.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what makes you think he'll come back?\" asked the Princesses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He always does come back,\" said September.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, my dear,\" said the eight Princesses, \"if you'll take our advice\nyou won't run any risks like that. If he comes back, and mind you, if he\ndoes you'll be lucky, pop him into the cage and keep him there. That's\nthe only way you can be sure of him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I like to have him fly about the room,\" said the Princess\nSeptember.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Safety first,\" said her sisters ominously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey got up and walked out of the room, shaking their heads, and they\nleft September very uneasy. It seemed to her that her little bird was\naway a long time and she could not think what he was doing. Something\nmight have happened to him. What with hawks and men with snares you\nnever knew what trouble he might get into. Besides, he might forget her,\nor he might take a fancy to somebody else; that would be dreadful; oh,\nshe wished he were safely back again, and in the golden cage that stood\nthere empty and ready. For when the Maids of Honour had buried the dead\nparrot they had left the cage in its old place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSuddenly September heard a tweet-tweet just behind her ear and she saw\nthe little bird sitting on her shoulder. He had come in so quietly and\nalighted so softly that she had not heard him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wondered what on earth had become of you,\" said the Princess.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought you'd wonder that,\" said the little bird. \"The fact is I very\nnearly didn't come back to-night at all. My father-in-law was giving a\nparty and they all wanted me to stay, but I thought you'd be anxious.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nUnder the circumstances this was a very unfortunate remark for the\nlittle bird to make.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSeptember felt her heart go thump, thump against her chest, and she made\nup her mind to take no more risks. She put up her hand and took hold of\nthe bird. This he was quite used to, she liked feeling his heart go\npit-a-pat, so fast, in the hollow of her hand, and I think he liked the\nsoft warmth of her little hand. So the bird suspected nothing and he was\nso surprised when she carried him over to the cage, popped him in, and\nshut the door on him for a moment he could think of nothing to say. But\nin a moment or two he hopped up on the ivory perch and said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is the joke?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no joke,\" said September, \"but some of mamma's cats are\nprowling about to-night, and I think you're much safer in there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I can't think why the Queen wants to have all those cats,\" said the\nlittle bird, rather crossly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you see, they're very special cats,\" said the Princess, \"they\nhave blue eyes and a kink in their tails, and they're a speciality of\nthe royal family, if you understand what I mean.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perfectly,\" said the little bird, \"but why did you put me in this cage\nwithout saying anything about it? I don't think it's the sort of place I\nlike.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shouldn't have slept a wink all night if I hadn't known you were\nsafe.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, just for this once I don't mind,\" said the little bird, \"so long\nas you let me out in the morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe ate a very good supper and then began to sing. But in the middle of\nhis song he stopped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what is the matter with me,\" he said, \"but I don't feel\nlike singing to-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well,\" said September, \"go to sleep instead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo he put his head under his wing and in a minute was fast asleep.\nSeptember went to sleep too. But when the dawn broke she was awakened by\nthe little bird calling her at the top of his voice:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wake up, wake up,\" he said. \"Open the door of this cage and let me out.\nI want to have a good fly while the dew is still on the ground.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're much better off where you are,\" said September. \"You have a\nbeautiful golden cage. It was made by the best workman in my papa's\nkingdom, and my papa was so pleased with it that he cut off his head so\nthat he should never make another.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me out, let me out,\" said the little bird.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'll have three meals a day served by my Maids of Honour; you'll have\nnothing to worry you from morning till night, and you can sing to your\nheart's content.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me out, let me out,\" said the little bird. And he tried to slip\nthrough the bars of the cage, but of course he couldn't, and he beat\nagainst the door but of course he couldn't open it. Then the eight\nPrincesses came in and looked at him. They told September she was very\nwise to take their advice. They said he would soon get used to the cage\nand in a few days would quite forget that he had ever been free. The\nlittle bird said nothing at all while they were there, but as soon as\nthey were gone he began to cry again: \"Let me out, let me out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be such an old silly,\" said September. \"I've only put you in the\ncage because I'm so fond of you. I know what's good for you much better\nthan you do yourself. Sing me a little song and I'll give you a piece of\nbrown sugar.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the little bird stood in the corner of his cage, looking out at the\nblue sky, and never sang a note. He never sang all day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's the good of sulking?\" said September. \"Why don't you sing and\nforget your troubles?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How can I sing?\" answered the bird. \"I want to see the trees and the\nlake and the green rice growing in the fields.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If that's all you want I'll take you for a walk,\" said September.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe picked up the cage and went out and she walked down to the lake\nround which grew the willow trees, and she stood at the edge of the\nrice-fields that stretched as far as the eye could see.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll take you out every day,\" she said. \"I love you and I only want to\nmake you happy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not the same thing,\" said the little bird. \"The rice-fields and\nthe lake and the willow trees look quite different when you see them\nthrough the bars of a cage.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo she brought him home again and gave him his supper. But he wouldn't\neat a thing. The Princess was a little anxious at this, and asked her\nsisters what they thought about it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must be firm,\" they said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But if he won't eat, he'll die,\" she answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That would be very ungrateful of him,\" they said. \"He must know that\nyou're only thinking of his own good. If he's obstinate and dies it'll\nserve him right and you'll be well rid of him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSeptember didn't see how that was going to do her very much good, but\nthey were eight to one and all older than she, so she said nothing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps he'll have got used to his cage by to-morrow,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd next day when she awoke she cried out good-morning in a cheerful\nvoice. She got no answer. She jumped out of bed and ran to the cage. She\ngave a startled cry, for there the little bird lay, at the bottom, on\nhis side, with his eyes closed, and he looked as if he were dead. She\nopened the door and putting her hand in lifted him out. She gave a sob\nof relief, for she felt that his little heart was beating still.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Wake up, wake up, little bird,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe began to cry and her tears fell on the little bird. He opened his\neyes and felt that the bars of the cage were no longer round him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I cannot sing unless I'm free and if I cannot sing, I die,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Princess gave a great sob.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then take your freedom,\" she said, \"I shut you in a golden cage because\nI loved you and wanted to have you all to myself. But I never knew it\nwould kill you. Go. Fly away among the trees that are round the lake and\nfly over the green rice-fields. I love you enough to let you be happy in\nyour own way.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe threw open the window and gently placed the little bird on the sill.\nHe shook himself a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come and go as you will, little bird,\" she said. \"I will never put you\nin a cage any more.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will come because I love you, little Princess,\" said the bird. \"And I\nwill sing you the loveliest songs I know. I shall go far away, but I\nshall always come back, and I shall never forget you.\" He gave himself\nanother shake. \"Good gracious me, how stiff I am,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen he opened his wings and flew right away into the blue. But the\nlittle Princess burst into tears, for it is very difficult to put the\nhappiness of someone you love before your own, and with her little bird\nfar out of sight she felt on a sudden very lonely. When her sisters knew\nwhat had happened they mocked her and said that the little bird would\nnever return. But he did at last. And he sat on September's shoulder and\nate out of her hand and sang her the beautiful songs he had learned\nwhile he was flying up and down the fair places of the world. September\nkept her window open day and night so that the little bird might come\ninto her room whenever he felt inclined, and this was very good for her;\nso she grew extremely beautiful. And when she was old enough she married\nthe King of Cambodia and was carried all the way to the city in which he\nlived on a white elephant. But her sisters never slept with their\nwindows open, so they grew extremely ugly as well as disagreeable, and\nwhen the time came to marry them off they were given away to the King's\ncouncillors with a pound of tea and a Siamese cat.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI left Bangkok on a shabby little ship of four or five hundred tons. The\ndingy saloon, which served also as dining-room, had two narrow tables\ndown its length with swivel chairs on both sides of them. The cabins\nwere in the bowels of the ship and they were extremely dirty.\nCockroaches walked about on the floor and however placid your\ntemperament it is difficult not to be startled when you go to the\nwash-basin to wash your hands and a huge cockroach stalks leisurely out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe dropped down the river, broad and lazy and smiling, and its green\nbanks were dotted with little huts on piles standing at the water's\nedge. We crossed the bar; and the open sea, blue and still, spread\nbefore me. The look of it and the smell of it filled me with elation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had gone on board early in the morning and soon discovered that I was\nthrown amid the oddest collection of persons I had ever encountered.\nThere were two French traders and a Belgian colonel, an Italian tenor,\nthe American proprietor of a circus with his wife, and a retired French\nofficial with his. The circus proprietor was what is termed a good\nmixer, a type which according to your mood you fly from or welcome, but\nI happened to be feeling much pleased with life and before I had been on\nboard an hour we had shaken for drinks, and he had shown me his animals.\nHe was a very short fat man and his stengah-shifter, white but none too\nclean, outlined the noble proportions of his abdomen, but the collar was\nso tight that you wondered he did not choke. He had a red, clean-shaven\nface, a merry blue eye and short, untidy sandy hair. He wore a battered\ntopee well on the back of his head. His name was Wilkins and he was born\nin Portland, Oregon. It appears that the Oriental has a passion for the\ncircus and Mr. Wilkins for twenty years had been travelling up and down\nthe East from Port Said to Yokohama (Aden, Bombay, Madras, Calcutta,\nRangoon, Singapore, Penang, Bangkok, Saigon, Huë, Hanoi, Hong-Kong,\nShanghai, their names roll on the tongue savourily, crowding the\nimagination with sunshine and strange sounds and a multicoloured\nactivity) with his menagerie and his merry-go-rounds. It was a strange\nlife he led, unusual and one that, one would have thought, must offer\nthe occasion for all sorts of curious experiences, but the odd thing\nabout him was that he was a perfectly commonplace little man and you\nwould have been prepared to find him running a garage or keeping a\nthird-rate hotel in a second-rate town in California. The fact is, and I\nhave noticed it so often that I do not know why it should always\nsurprise me, that the extraordinariness of a man's life does not make\nhim extraordinary, but contrariwise if a man is extraordinary he will\nmake extraordinariness out of a life as humdrum as that of a country\ncurate. I wish I could feel it reasonable to tell here the story of the\nhermit I went to see on an island in the Torres Straits, a shipwrecked\nmariner who had lived there alone for thirty years, but when you are\nwriting a book you are imprisoned by the four walls of your subject and\nthough for the entertainment of my own digressing mind I set it down now\nI should be forced in the end, by my sense of what is fit to go between\ntwo covers and what is not, to cut it out. Anyhow, the long and short of\nit is that notwithstanding his long and intimate communion with nature\nand his thoughts the man was as dull, insensitive and vulgar an oaf at\nthe end of this experience as he must have been at the beginning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Italian singer passed us and Mr. Wilkins told me that he was a\nNeapolitan who was on his way to Hong-Kong to rejoin his company, which\nhe had been forced to leave owing to an attack of malaria in Bangkok. He\nwas an enormous fellow, and very fat, and when he flung himself into a\nchair it creaked with dismay. He took off his topee, displayed a great\nhead of long, curly, greasy hair, and ran podgy and beringed fingers\nthrough it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He ain't very sociable,\" said Mr. Wilkins. \"He took the cigar I gave\nhim, but he wouldn't have a drink. I shouldn't wonder if there wasn't\nsomethin' rather queer about him. Nasty-lookin' guy, ain't he?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen a little fat woman in white came on deck holding by the hand a\nWa-Wa monkey. It walked solemnly by her side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is Mrs. Wilkins,\" said the circus proprietor, \"and our youngest\nson. Draw up a chair, Mrs. Wilkins, and meet this gentleman. I don't\nknow his name, but he's already paid for two drinks for me and if he\ncan't shake any better than he has yet he'll pay for one for you too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Wilkins sat down with an abstracted, serious look, and with her\neyes on the blue sea suggested that she did not see why she shouldn't\nhave a lemonade.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My, it's hot,\" she murmured, fanning herself with the topee which she\ntook off.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Wilkins feels the heat,\" said her husband. \"She's had twenty years\nof it now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Twenty-two and a half,\" said Mrs. Wilkins, still looking at the sea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And she's never got used to it yet.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nor never shall and you know it,\" said Mrs. Wilkins.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was just the same size as her husband and just as fat, and she had a\nround red face like his and the same sandy, untidy hair. I wondered if\nthey had married because they were so exactly alike, or if in the course\nof years they had acquired this astonishing resemblance. She did not\nturn her head but continued to look absently at the sea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you shown him the animals?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You bet your life I have.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What did he think of Percy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Thought him fine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI could not but feel that I was being unduly left out of a conversation\nof which I was at all events partly the subject, so I asked:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who's Percy?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Percy's our eldest son. There's a flyin'-fish, Elmer. He's the\noran-utan. Did he eat his food well this morning?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fine. He's the biggest oran-utan in captivity. I wouldn't take a\nthousand dollars for him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And what relation is the elephant?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Wilkins did not look at me, but with her blue eyes still gazed\nindifferently at the sea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's no relation,\" she answered. \"Only a friend.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe boy brought lemonade for Mrs. Wilkins, a whisky and soda for her\nhusband and a gin and tonic for me. We shook dice and I signed the chit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It must come expensive if he always loses when he shakes,\" Mrs. Wilkins\nmurmured to the coast-line.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I guess Egbert would like a sip of your lemonade, my dear,\" said Mr.\nWilkins.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Wilkins slightly turned her head and looked at the monkey sitting\non her lap.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would you like a sip of mother's lemonade, Egbert?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe monkey gave a little squeak and putting her arm round him she handed\nhim a straw. The monkey sucked up a little lemonade and having drunk\nenough sank back against Mrs. Wilkins' ample bosom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Wilkins thinks the world of Egbert,\" said her husband. \"You can't\nwonder at it, he's her youngest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Wilkins took another straw and thoughtfully drank her lemonade.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Egbert's all right,\" she remarked. \"There's nothin' wrong with Egbert.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJust then the French official, who had been sitting down, got up and\nbegan walking up and down. He had been accompanied on board by the\nFrench minister at Bangkok, one or two secretaries and a prince of the\nroyal family. There had been a great deal of bowing and shaking of hands\nand as the ship slipped away from the quay much waving of hats and\nhandkerchiefs. He was evidently a person of consequence. I had heard the\ncaptain address him as Monsieur le Gouverneur.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's the big noise on this boat,\" said Mr. Wilkins. \"He was Governor\nof one of the French colonies and now he's makin' a tour of the world.\nHe came to see my circus at Bangkok. I guess I'll ask him what he'll\nhave. What shall I call him, my dear?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Wilkins slowly turned her head and looked at the Frenchman, with\nthe rosette of the Legion of Honour in his buttonhole, pacing up and\ndown.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't call him anythin',\" she said. \"Show him a hoop and he'll jump\nright through it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI could not but laugh. Monsieur le Gouverneur was a little man, well\nbelow the average height, and smally made, with a very ugly little face\nand thick, almost negroid features; and he had a bushy grey head, bushy\ngrey eyebrows and a bushy grey moustache. He did look a little like a\npoodle and he had the poodle's soft, intelligent and shining eyes. Next\ntime he passed us Mr. Wilkins called out:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Monsoo. Qu'est ce que vous prenez?</i>\" I cannot reproduce the\neccentricities of his accent. \"<i>Une petite verre de porto.</i>\" He turned\nto me. \"Foreigners, they all drink porto. You're always safe with that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not the Dutch,\" said Mrs. Wilkins, with a look at the sea. \"They won't\ntouch nothin' but Schnapps.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe distinguished Frenchman stopped and looked at Mr. Wilkins with some\nbewilderment. Whereupon Mr. Wilkins tapped his breast and said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Moa, proprietarre Cirque. Vous avez visité.</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen, for a reason that escaped me, Mr. Wilkins made his arms into a\nhoop and outlined the gestures that represented a poodle jumping through\nit. Then he pointed at the Wa-Wa that Mrs. Wilkins was still holding on\nher lap.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>La petit fils de mon femme</i>,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLight broke upon the Governor and he burst into a peculiarly musical and\ninfectious laugh. Mr. Wilkins began laughing too.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Oui, oui</i>,\" he cried. \"<i>Moa</i>, circus proprietor. <i>Une petite verre de\nporto. Oui. Oui. N'est ce pas?</i>\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Wilkins talks French like a Frenchman,\" Mrs. Wilkins informed the\npassing sea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Mais très volontiers</i>,\" said the Governor, still smiling. I drew him\nup a chair and he sat down with a bow to Mrs. Wilkins.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell poodle-face his name's Egbert,\" she said, looking at the sea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI called the boy and we ordered a round of drinks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You sign the chit, Elmer,\" she said. \"It's not a bit of good Mr.\nWhat's-his-name shakin' if he can't shake nothin' better than a pair of\ntreys.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Vous comprenez le français, madame?</i>\" asked the Governor politely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He wants to know if you speak French, my dear.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where does he think I was raised? Naples?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen the Governor, with exuberant gesticulation, burst into a torrent of\nEnglish so fantastic that it required all my knowledge of French to\nunderstand what he was talking about.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPresently Mr. Wilkins took him down to look at his animals and a little\nlater we assembled in the stuffy saloon for luncheon. The Governor's\nwife appeared and was put on the captain's right. The Governor explained\nto her who we all were and she gave us a gracious bow. She was a large\nwoman, tall and of a robust build, of fifty-five perhaps, and she was\ndressed somewhat severely in black silk. On her head she wore a huge\nround topee. Her features were so large and regular, her form so\nstatuesque, that you were reminded of the massive females who take part\nin processions. She would have admirably suited the rôle of Columbia or\nBritannia in a patriotic demonstration. She towered over her diminutive\nhusband like a skyscraper over a shack. He talked incessantly, with\nvivacity and wit, and when he said anything amusing her heavy features\nrelaxed into a large, fond smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Que tu es bête, mon ami</i>,\" she said. She turned to the captain. \"You\nmust not pay any attention to him. He is always like that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe had indeed a very amusing meal and when it was over we separated to\nour various cabins to sleep away the heat of the afternoon. In such a\nsmall ship having once made the acquaintance of my fellow-passengers, it\nwould have been impossible, even had I wished it, not to pass with them\nevery moment of the day that I was not in my cabin. The only person who\nheld himself aloof was the Italian tenor. He spoke to no one, but sat by\nhimself as far forward as he could get, twanging a guitar in an\nundertone so that you had to strain your ears to catch the notes. We\nremained in sight of land and the sea was like a pail of milk. Talking\nof one thing and another we watched the day decline, we dined, and then\nwe sat out again on deck under the stars. The two traders played piquet\nin the hot saloon, but the Belgian colonel joined our little group. He\nwas shy and fat and opened his mouth only to utter a civility. Soon,\ninfluenced perhaps by the night and encouraged by the darkness that gave\nhim, up there in the bows, the sensation of being alone with the sea,\nthe Italian tenor, accompanying himself on his guitar, began to sing,\nfirst in a low tone, and then a little louder, till presently, his music\ncaptivating him, he sang with all his might. He had the real Italian\nvoice, all macaroni, olive oil and sunshine, and he sang the Neapolitan\nsongs that I had heard in my youth in the Piazza San Ferdinando, and\nfragments from <i>La Bohème</i>, and <i>Traviata</i> and <i>Rigoletto</i>. He sang with\nemotion and false emphasis and his tremolo reminded you of every\nthird-rate Italian tenor you had ever heard, but there in the openness\nof that lovely night his exaggerations only made you smile and you could\nnot but feel in your heart a lazy sensual pleasure. He sang for an hour,\nperhaps, and we all fell silent; then he was still, but he did not move\nand we saw his huge bulk dimly outlined against the luminous sky.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI saw that the little French Governor had been holding the hand of his\nlarge wife and the sight was absurd and touching.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you know that this is the anniversary of the day on which I first\nsaw my wife?\" he said, suddenly breaking the silence which had certainly\nweighed on him, for I had never met a more loquacious creature. \"It is\nalso the anniversary of the day on which she promised to be my wife.\nAnd, which will surprise you, they were one and the same.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Voyons, mon ami</i>,\" said the lady, \"you are not going to bore our\nfriends with that old story. You are really quite insupportable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut she spoke with a smile on her large, firm face, and in a tone that\nsuggested that she was quite willing to hear it again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But it will interest them, <i>mon petit chou</i>.\" It was in this way that\nhe always addressed his wife and it was funny to hear this imposing and\neven majestic lady thus addressed by her small husband. \"Will it not,\n<i>monsieur</i>?\" he asked me. \"It is a romance and who does not like\nromance, especially on such a night as this?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI assured the Governor that we were all anxious to hear and the Belgian\ncolonel took the opportunity once more to be polite.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see, ours was a marriage of convenience pure and simple.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>C'est vrai</i>,\" said the lady. \"It would be stupid to deny it. But\nsometimes love comes after marriage and not before, and then it is\nbetter. It lasts longer.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI could not but notice that the Governor gave her hand an affectionate\nlittle squeeze.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see, I had been in the navy, and when I retired I was forty-nine. I\nwas strong and active and I was very anxious to find an occupation. I\nlooked about; I pulled all the strings I could. Fortunately I had a\ncousin who had some political importance. It is one of the advantages of\ndemocratic government that if you have sufficient influence, merit,\nwhich otherwise might pass unnoticed, generally receives its due\nreward.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are modesty itself, <i>mon pauvre ami</i>,\" said she.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And presently I was sent for by the Minister to the Colonies and\noffered the post of Governor in a certain colony. It was a very distant\nspot that they wished to send me to and a lonely one, but I had spent my\nlife wandering from port to port, and that was not a matter that\ntroubled me. I accepted with joy. The minister told me that I must be\nready to start in a month. I told him that would be easy for an old\nbachelor who had nothing much in the world but a few clothes and a few\nbooks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'<i>Comment, mon lieutenant</i>,' he cried. 'You are a bachelor?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Certainly,' I answered. 'And I have every intention of remaining one.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'In that case I am afraid I must withdraw my offer. For this position\nit is essential that you should be married.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is too long a story to tell you, but the gist of it was that owing\nto the scandal my predecessor, a bachelor, had caused by having native\ngirls to live in the Residency and the consequent complaints of the\nwhite people, planters and the wives of functionaries, it had been\ndecided that the next Governor must be a model of respectability. I\nexpostulated. I argued. I recapitulated my services to the country and\nthe services my cousin could render at the next elections. Nothing would\nserve. The minister was adamant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'But what can I do?' I cried with dismay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You can marry,' said the minister.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'<i>Mais voyons, monsieur le ministre</i>, I do not know any women. I am not\na lady's man and I am forty-nine. How do you expect me to find a wife?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Nothing is more simple. Put an advertisement in the paper.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was confounded. I did not know what to say.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Well, think it over,' said the minister. 'If you can find a wife in a\nmonth you can go, but no wife no job. That is my last word.' He smiled a\nlittle, to him the situation was not without humour. 'And if you think\nof advertising I recommend the <i>Figaro</i>.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I walked away from the ministry with death in my heart. I knew the\nplace to which they desired to appoint me and I knew it would suit me\nvery well to live there; the climate was tolerable and the Residency was\nspacious and comfortable. The notion of being a Governor was far from\ndispleasing me and, having nothing much but my pension as a naval\nofficer, the salary was not to be despised. Suddenly I made up my mind.\nI walked to the offices of the <i>Figaro</i>, composed an advertisement and\nhanded it in for insertion. But I can tell you, when I walked up the\nChamps Elysées afterwards my heart was beating much more furiously than\nit had ever done when my ship was stripped for action.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Governor leaned forward and put his hand impressively on my knee.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Mon cher monsieur</i>, you will never believe it, but I had four thousand\nthree hundred and seventy-two replies. It was an avalanche. I had\nexpected half-a-dozen; I had to take a cab to take the letters to my\nhotel. My room was swamped with them. There were four thousand three\nhundred and seventy-two women who were willing to share my solitude and\nbe a Governor's lady. It was staggering. They were of all ages from\nseventeen to seventy. There were maidens of irreproachable ancestry and\nthe highest culture, there were unmarried ladies who had made a little\nslip at one period of their career and now desired to regularise their\nsituation; there were widows whose husbands had died in the most\nharrowing circumstances; and there were widows whose children would be a\nsolace to my old age. They were blonde and dark, tall and short, fat and\nthin; some could speak five languages and others could play the piano.\nSome offered me love and some craved for it; some could only give me a\nsolid friendship but mingled with esteem; some had a fortune and others\ngolden prospects. I was overwhelmed. I was bewildered. At last I lost my\ntemper, for I am a passionate man, and I got up and I stamped on all\nthose letters and all those photographs and I cried: I will marry none\nof them. It was hopeless, I had less than a month now and I could not\nsee over four thousand aspirants to my hand in that time. I felt that if\nI did not see them all, I should be tortured for the rest of my life by\nthe thought that I had missed the one woman the fates had destined to\nmake me happy. I gave it up as a bad job.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I went out of my room hideous with all those photographs and littered\npapers and to drive care away went on to the boulevard and sat down at\nthe Café de la Paix. After a time I saw a friend passing and he nodded\nto me and smiled. I tried to smile but my heart was sore. I realised\nthat I must spend the years that remained to me in a cheap <i>pension</i> at\nToulon or Brest as an <i>officier de marine en retraite</i>. <i>Zut!</i> My friend\nstopped and coming up to me sat down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What is making you look so glum, <i>mon cher</i>?' he asked me. 'You who\nare the gayest of mortals.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was glad to have someone in whom I could confide my troubles and told\nhim the whole story. He laughed consumedly. I have thought since that\nperhaps the incident had its comic side, but at the time, I assure you,\nI could see in it nothing to laugh at. I mentioned the fact to my friend\nnot without asperity and then, controlling his mirth as best he could,\nhe said to me: 'But, my dear fellow, do you really want to marry?' At\nthis I entirely lost my temper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You are completely idiotic,' I said. 'If I did not want to marry, and\nwhat is more marry at once, within the next fortnight, do you imagine\nthat I should have spent three days reading love letters from women I\nhave never set eyes on?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Calm yourself and listen to me,' he replied. 'I have a cousin who\nlives in Geneva. She is Swiss, <i>du reste</i>, and she belongs to a family\nof the greatest respectability in the republic. Her morals are without\nreproach, she is of a suitable age, a spinster, for she has spent the\nlast fifteen years nursing an invalid mother who has lately died, she is\nwell educated and <i>pardessus le marché</i> she is not ugly.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It sounds as though she were a paragon,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I do not say that, but she has been well brought up and would become\nthe position you have to offer her.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'There is one thing you forget. What inducement would there be for her\nto give up her friends and her accustomed life to accompany in exile a\nman of forty-nine who is by no means a beauty?'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMonsieur le Gouverneur broke off his narrative and shrugging his\nshoulders so emphatically that his head almost sank between them, turned\nto us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am ugly. I admit it. I am of an ugliness that does not inspire terror\nor respect, but only ridicule, and that is the worst ugliness of all.\nWhen people see me for the first time they do not shrink with horror,\nthere would evidently be something flattering in that, they burst out\nlaughing. Listen, when the admirable Mr. Wilkins showed me his animals\nthis morning, Percy, the oran-utan, held out his arms and but for the\nbars of the cage would have clasped me to his bosom as a long-lost\nbrother. Once indeed when I was at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris and\nwas told that one of the anthropoid apes had escaped I made my way to\nthe exit as quickly as I could in fear that, mistaking me for the\nrefugee, they would seize me and, notwithstanding my expostulations,\nshut me up in the monkey house.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"<i>Voyons, mon ami</i>,\" said Madame his wife, in her deep slow voice, \"you\nare talking even greater nonsense than usual. I do not say that you are\nan Apollo, in your position it is unnecessary that you should be, but\nyou have dignity, you have poise, you are what any woman would call a\nfine man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will resume my story. When I made this remark to my friend he\nreplied: 'One can never tell with women. There is something about\nmarriage that wonderfully attracts them. There would be no harm in\nasking her. After all it is regarded as a compliment by a woman to be\nasked in marriage. She can but refuse.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'But I do not know your cousin and I do not see how I am to make her\nacquaintance. I cannot go to her house, ask to see her and when I am\nshown into the drawing-room say: <i>Voilà</i>, I have come to ask you to\nmarry me. She would think I was a lunatic and scream for help. Besides,\nI am a man of an extreme timidity, and I could never take such a step.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I will tell you what to do,' said my friend. 'Go to Geneva and take\nher a box of chocolates from me. She will be glad to have news of me and\nwill receive you with pleasure. You can have a little talk and then if\nyou do not like the look of her you take your leave and no harm is done.\nIf on the other hand you do, we can go into the matter and you can make\na formal demand for her hand.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was desperate. It seemed the only thing to do. We went to a shop at\nonce and bought an enormous box of chocolates and that night I took the\ntrain to Geneva. No sooner had I arrived than I sent her a letter to say\nthat I was the bearer of a gift from her cousin and much wished to give\nmyself the pleasure of delivering it in person. Within an hour I\nreceived her reply to the effect that she would be pleased to receive me\nat four o'clock in the afternoon. I spent the interval before my mirror\nand seventeen times I tied and retied my tie. As the clock struck four I\npresented myself at the door of her house and was immediately ushered\ninto the drawing-room. She was waiting for me. Her cousin said she was\nnot ugly. Imagine my surprise to see a young woman, <i>enfin</i> a woman\nstill young, of a noble presence, with the dignity of Juno, the features\nof Venus, and in her expression the intelligence of Minerva.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are too absurd,\" said Madame. \"But by now these gentlemen know that\none cannot believe all you say.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I swear to you that I do not exaggerate. I was so taken aback that I\nnearly dropped the box of chocolates. But I said to myself: <i>La garde\nmeurt mais ne se rend pas</i>. I presented the box of chocolates. I gave\nher news of her cousin. I found her amiable. We talked for a quarter of\nan hour. And then I said to myself: <i>Allons-y</i>. I said to her:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Mademoiselle, I must tell you that I did not come here merely to give\nyou a box of chocolates.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She smiled and remarked that evidently I must have had reasons to come\nto Geneva of more importance than that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I came to ask you to do me the honour of marrying me.' She gave a\nstart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'But, <i>monsieur</i>, you are mad,' she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I beseech you not to answer till you have heard the facts,' I\ninterrupted, and before she could say another word I told her the whole\nstory. I told her about my advertisement in the <i>Figaro</i> and she laughed\ntill the tears ran down her face. Then I repeated my offer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You are serious?' she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I have never been more serious in my life.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I will not deny that your offer has come as a surprise. I had not\nthought of marrying, I have passed the age; but evidently your offer is\nnot one that a woman should refuse without consideration. I am\nflattered. Will you give me a few days to reflect?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'<i>Mademoiselle</i>, I am absolutely desolated,' I replied. 'But I have not\ntime. If you will not marry me I must go back to Paris and resume my\nperusal of the fifteen or eighteen hundred letters that still await my\nattention.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It is quite evident that I cannot possibly give you an answer at once.\nI had not set eyes on you a quarter of an hour ago. I must consult my\nfriends and my family.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What have they got to do with it? You are of full age. The matter is\npressing. I cannot wait. I have told you everything. You are an\nintelligent woman. What can prolonged reflection add to the impulse of\nthe moment?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You are not asking me to say yes or no this very minute? That is\noutrageous.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'That is exactly what I am asking. My train goes back to Paris in a\ncouple of hours.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She looked at me reflectively.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You are quite evidently a lunatic. You ought to be shut up both for\nyour own safety and that of the public.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Well, which is it to be?' I said. 'Yes or no?'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She shrugged her shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'<i>Mon Dieu.</i>' She waited a minute and I was on tenterhooks. 'Yes.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Governor waved his hand towards his wife.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And there she is. We were married in a fortnight and I became Governor\nof a colony. I married a jewel, my dear sirs, a woman of the most\ncharming character, one in a thousand, a woman of a masculine\nintelligence and a feminine sensibility, an admirable woman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But hold your tongue, <i>mon ami</i>,\" his wife said. \"You are making me as\nridiculous as yourself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe turned to the Belgian colonel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you a bachelor, <i>mon colonel</i>? If so I strongly recommend you to go\nto Geneva. It is a nest (<i>une pépinière</i> was the word he used) of the\nmost adorable young women. You will find a wife there as nowhere else.\nGeneva is besides a charming city. Do not waste a minute, but go there\nand I will give you a letter to my wife's nieces.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was she who summed up the story.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The fact is that in a marriage of convenience you expect less and so\nyou are less likely to be disappointed. As you do not make senseless\nclaims on one another there is no reason for exasperation. You do not\nlook for perfection and so you are tolerant to one another's faults.\nPassion is all very well, but it is not a proper foundation for\nmarriage. <i>Voyez-vous</i>, for two people to be happy in marriage they must\nbe able to respect one another, they must be of the same condition and\ntheir interests must be alike; then if they are decent people and are\nwilling to give and take, to live and let live, there is no reason why\ntheir union should not be as happy as ours.\" She paused. \"But, of\ncourse, my husband is a very, very remarkable man.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI had been wandering about the East for months and at last reached\nHaiphong. It is a commercial town and a dull one, but I knew that from\nthere I could find a ship of sorts to take me to Hong-Kong. I had some\ndays to wait and nothing to do. It is true that from Haiphong you can\nvisit the Bay of Along, which is one of the <i>sehenswürdigkeiten</i> of\nIndo-China, but I was tired of sights. I contented myself with sitting\nin the cafés, for here it was none too warm and I was glad to get out of\ntropical clothes, and reading back numbers of <i>L'Illustration</i>, or for\nthe sake of exercise taking a brisk walk along straight, wide streets.\nHaiphong is traversed by canals and sometimes I got a glimpse of a scene\nwhich in its varied life, with all the native craft on the water, was\nmulticoloured and charming. There was one canal, with tall Chinese\nhouses on each side of it, that had a pleasant curve. The houses were\nwhitewashed, but the whitewash was discoloured and stained; with their\ngrey roofs they made an agreeable composition against the pale sky. The\npicture had the faded elegance of an old water-colour. There was nowhere\nan emphatic note. It was soft and a little weary and inspired one with a\nfaint melancholy. I was reminded I scarcely know why of an old maid I\nknew in my youth, a relic of the Victorian age, who wore black silk\nmittens and made crochet shawls for the poor, black for widows and white\nfor married women. She had suffered in her youth, but whether from\nill-health or unrequited love, no one exactly knew.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut there was a local paper at Haiphong, a small dingy sheet with stubby\ntype the ink of which came off on your fingers, and it gave you a\npolitical article, the wireless news, advertisements and local\nintelligence. The editor, doubtless hard pressed for matter, printed the\nnames of the persons, Europeans, natives of the country and Chinese, who\nhad arrived at Haiphong or left it, and mine was put in with the rest.\nOn the morning of the day before that on which the old tub I was taking\nwas to sail for Hong-Kong I was sitting in the café of the hotel\ndrinking a Dubonnet before luncheon when the boy came in and said that a\ngentleman wished to see me. I did not know a soul in Haiphong and asked\nwho it was. The boy said he was an Englishman and lived there, but he\ncould not tell me his name. The boy spoke very little French and it was\nhard for me to understand what he said. I was mystified, but told him to\nshow the visitor in. A moment later he came back followed by a white man\nand pointed me out to him. The man gave me a look and walked towards me.\nHe was a very tall fellow, well over six feet high, rather fat and\nbloated, with a red, clean-shaven face and extremely pale blue eyes. He\nwore very shabby khaki shorts and a stengah-shifter unbuttoned at the\nneck, and a battered helmet. I concluded at once that he was a stranded\nbeachcomber who was going to touch me for a loan and wondered how little\nI could hope to get off for.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe came up to me and held out a large red hand with broken, dirty nails.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't suppose you remember me,\" he said. \"My name's Grosely. I was at\nSt. Thomas's Hospital with you. I recognised your name as soon as I saw\nit in the paper and I thought I'd look you up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had not the smallest recollection of him, but I asked him to sit down\nand offered him a drink. By his appearance I had first thought he would\nask me for ten piastres and I might have given him five, but now it\nlooked more likely that he would ask for a hundred and I should have to\nthink myself lucky if I could content him with fifty. The habitual\nborrower always asks twice what he expects to get and it only\ndissatisfies him to give him what he has asked since then he is vexed\nwith himself for not having asked more. He feels you have cheated him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you a doctor?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I was only at the bloody place a year.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took off his sun-helmet and showed me a mop of grey hair, which much\nneeded a brush. His face was curiously mottled and he did not look\nhealthy. His teeth were badly decayed and at the corners of his mouth\nwere empty spaces. When the boy came to take the orders he asked for\nbrandy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Bring the bottle,\" he said. \"<i>La bouteille.</i> Savvy?\" He turned to me.\n\"I've been living here for the last five years, but I can't get along\nwith French somehow. I talk Tonkinese.\" He leaned his chair back and\nlooked at me. \"I remember you, you know. You used to go about with those\ntwins. What was their name? I expect I've changed more than you have.\nI've spent the best part of my life in China. Rotten climate, you know.\nIt plays hell with a man.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI still had not the smallest recollection of him. I thought it best to\nsay so.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Were you the same year as I was?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. '92.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a devil of a long time ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAbout sixty boys and young men entered the hospital every year; they\nwere most of them shy and confused by the new life they were entering\nupon; many had never been in London before; and to me at least they were\nshadows that passed without any particular rhyme or reason across a\nwhite sheet. During the first year a certain number for one reason or\nanother dropped out, and in the second year those that remained gained\nby degrees the beginnings of a personality. They were not only\nthemselves, but the lectures one had attended with them, the scone and\ncoffee one had eaten at the same table for luncheon, the dissection one\nhad done at the same board in the same dissecting room, and <i>The Belle\nof New York</i> one had seen together from the pit of the Shaftesbury\nTheatre.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe boy brought the bottle of brandy and Grosely, if that was really his\nname, pouring himself out a generous helping drank it down at a gulp\nwithout water or soda.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I couldn't stand doctoring,\" he said, \"I chucked it. My people got fed\nup with me and I went out to China. They gave me a hundred pounds and\ntold me to shift for myself. I was damned glad to get out, I can tell\nyou. I guess I was just about as much fed up with them as they were with\nme. I haven't troubled them much since.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen from somewhere in the depths of my memory a faint hint crept into\nthe rim, as it were, of consciousness, as on a rising tide the water\nslides up the sand and then withdraws to advance with the next wave in a\nfuller volume. I had first an inkling of some shabby little scandal that\nhad got into the papers. Then I saw a boy's face, and so gradually the\nfacts recurred to me; I remembered him now. I didn't believe he was\ncalled Grosely then, I think he had a one-syllabled name, but that I was\nuncertain of. He was a very tall lad (I began to see him quite well),\nthin, with a slight stoop, he was only eighteen and had grown too fast\nfor his strength, he had curly, shining brown hair, rather large\nfeatures (they did not look so large now, perhaps because his face was\nfat and puffy) and a peculiarly fresh complexion, very pink and white,\nlike a girl's. I imagine people, women especially, would have thought\nhim a very handsome boy, but to us he was only a clumsy, shuffling lout.\nThen I remembered that he did not often come to lectures, no, it wasn't\nthat I remembered, there were too many students in the theatre to\nrecollect who was there and who wasn't. I remembered the dissecting\nroom. He had a leg at the next table to the one I was working at and he\nhardly ever touched it; I forget why the men who had other parts of the\nbody complained of his neglecting the work, I suppose somehow it\ninterfered with them. In those days a good deal of gossip went on over\nthe dissection of a \"part\" and out of the distance of thirty years some\nof it came back to me. Someone started the story that Grosely was a very\ngay dog. He drank like a fish and was an awful womaniser. Most of those\nboys were very simple, and they had brought to the hospital the notions\nthey had acquired at home and at school. Some were prudish and they were\nshocked; others, those who worked hard, sneered at him and asked how he\ncould hope to pass his exams; but a good many were excited and\nimpressed, he was doing what they would have liked to do if they had had\nthe courage. Grosely had his admirers and you could often see him\nsurrounded by a little band listening open-mouthed to stories of his\nadventures. Recollections now were crowding upon me. In a very little\nwhile he lost his shyness and assumed the airs of a man of the world.\nThey must have looked absurd on this smooth-cheeked boy with his pink\nand white skin. Men (so they called themselves) used to tell one another\nof his escapades. He became quite a hero. He would make caustic remarks\nas he passed the museum and saw a pair of earnest students going over\ntheir anatomy together. He was at home in the public-houses of the\nneighbourhood and was on familiar terms with the barmaids. Looking back,\nI imagine that, newly arrived from the country and the tutelage of\nparents and schoolmasters, he was captivated by his freedom and the\nthrill of London. His dissipations were harmless enough. They were due\nonly to the urge of youth. He lost his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut we were all very poor and we did not know how Grosely managed to pay\nfor his garish amusements. We knew his father was a country doctor and I\nthink we knew exactly how much he gave his son a month. It was not\nenough to pay for the harlots he picked up on the promenade at the\nPavilion and for the drinks he stood his friends in the Criterion Bar.\nWe told one another in awe-struck tones that he must be getting\nfearfully into debt. Of course he could pawn things, but we knew by\nexperience that you could not get more than three pounds for a\nmicroscope and thirty shillings for a skeleton. We said he must be\nspending at least ten pounds a week. Our ideas were not very grand and\nthis seemed to us the wildest pitch of extravagance. At last one of his\nfriends disclosed the mystery: Grosely had discovered a wonderful system\nfor making money. It amused and impressed us. None of us would have\nthought of anything so ingenious or have had the nerve to attempt it if\nhe had. Grosely went to auctions, not Christie's, of course, but\nauctions in the Strand and Oxford Street, and in private houses, and\nbought anything portable that was going cheap. Then he took his purchase\nto a pawnbroker's and pawned it for ten shillings or a pound more than\nhe had paid. He was making money, four or five pounds a week, and he\nsaid he was going to give up medicine and make a regular business of it.\nNot one of us had ever made a penny in his life and we regarded Grosely\nwith admiration.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By Jove, he's clever,\" we said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's just about as sharp as they make them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's the sort that ends up as a millionaire.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe were all very worldly-wise and what we didn't know about life at\neighteen we were pretty sure wasn't worth knowing. It was a pity that\nwhen an examiner asked us a question we were so nervous that the answer\noften flew straight out of our head and when a nurse asked us to post a\nletter we blushed scarlet. It became known that the Dean had sent for\nGrosely and hauled him over the coals. He had threatened him with sundry\npenalties if he continued systematically to neglect his work. Grosely\nwas indignant. He'd had enough of that sort of thing at school, he said,\nhe wasn't going to let a horse-faced eunuch treat him like a boy. Damn\nit all, he was getting on for nineteen and there wasn't much you could\nteach him. The Dean had said he heard he was drinking more than was good\nfor him. Damned cheek. He could carry his liquor as well as any man of\nhis age, he'd been blind last Saturday and he meant to get blind next\nSaturday, and if anyone didn't like it he could do the other thing.\nGrosely's friends quite agreed with him that a man couldn't let himself\nbe insulted like that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the blow fell at last and now I remembered quite well the shock it\ngave us all. I suppose we had not seen Grosely for two or three days,\nbut he had been in the habit of coming to the hospital more and more\nirregularly, so if we thought anything about it, I imagine we merely\nsaid that he was off on one of his bats. He would turn up again in a day\nor so, rather pale, but with a wonderful story of some girl he had\npicked up and the time he had had with her. The anatomy lecture was at\nnine in the morning and it was a rush to get there in time. On this\nparticular day little attention was paid to the lecturer, who, with a\nvisible pleasure in his limpid English and admirable elocution, was\ndescribing I know not what part of the human skeleton, for there was\nmuch excited whispering along the benches and a newspaper was\nsurreptitiously passed from hand to hand. Suddenly the lecturer stopped.\nHe had a pedagogic sarcasm. He affected not to know the names of his\nstudents.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am afraid I am disturbing the gentleman who is reading the paper.\nAnatomy is a very tedious science and I regret that the regulations of\nthe Royal College of Surgeons oblige me to ask you to give it enough of\nyour attention to pass an examination in it. Any gentleman, however, who\nfinds this impossible is at liberty to continue his perusal of the paper\noutside.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe wretched boy to whom this reproof was addressed reddened to the\nroots of his hair and in his embarrassment tried to stuff the newspaper\nin his pocket. The professor of anatomy observed him coldly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am afraid, sir, that the paper is a little too large to go into your\npocket,\" he remarked. \"Perhaps you would be good enough to hand it down\nto me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe newspaper was passed from row to row to the well of the theatre,\nand, not content with the confusion to which he had put the poor lad,\nthe eminent surgeon, taking it, asked:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"May I enquire what it is in the paper that the gentleman in question\nfound of such absorbing interest?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe student who gave it to him without a word pointed out the paragraph\nthat we had all been reading. The professor read it and we watched him\nin silence. He put the paper down and went on with his lecture. The\nheadline ran <i>Arrest of a Medical Student</i>. Grosely had been brought\nbefore the police-court magistrate for getting goods on credit and\npawning them. It appears that this is an indictable offence and the\nmagistrate had remanded him for a week. Bail was refused. It looked as\nthough his method of making money by buying things at auctions and\npawning them had not in the long run proved as steady a source of income\nas he expected and he had found it more profitable to pawn things that\nhe was not at the expense of paying for. We talked the matter over\nexcitedly as soon as the lecture was over and I am bound to say that,\nhaving no property ourselves, so deficient was our sense of its sanctity\nwe could none of us look upon his crime as a very serious one; but with\nthe natural love of the young for the terrible there were few who did\nnot think he would get anything from two years hard labour to seven\nyears penal servitude.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI do not know why, but I did not seem to have any recollection of what\nhappened to Grosely. I think he may have been arrested towards the end\nof a session and his case may have come on again when we had all\nseparated for holidays. I did not know if it was disposed of by the\npolice-court magistrate or whether it went up for trial. I had a sort of\nfeeling that he was sentenced to a short term of imprisonment, six weeks\nperhaps, for his operations had been pretty extensive; but I knew that\nhe had vanished from our midst and in a little while was thought of no\nmore. It was strange to me that after all these years I should recollect\nso much of the incident so clearly. It was as though, turning over an\nalbum of old snapshots, I saw all at once the photograph of a scene I\nhad quite forgotten.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut of course in that gross elderly man with grey hair and mottled red\nface I should never have recognised the lanky pink-cheeked boy. He\nlooked sixty, but I knew he must be much less than that. I wondered what\nhe had done with himself in the intervening time. It did not look as\nthough he had excessively prospered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What were you doing in China?\" I asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was a tide-waiter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, were you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt is not a position of great importance and I took care to keep out of\nmy tone any note of surprise. The tide-waiters are employees of the\nChinese Customs whose duty it is to board the ships and junks at the\nvarious treaty ports and I think their chief business is to prevent\nopium-smuggling. They are mostly retired A.B.s from the Royal Navy and\nnon-commissioned officers who have finished their time. I have seen them\ncome on board at various places up the Yangtse. They hobnob with the\npilot and the engineer, but the skipper is a trifle curt with them. They\nlearn to speak Chinese more fluently than most Europeans and often marry\nChinese women.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When I left England I swore I wouldn't go back till I'd made my pile.\nAnd I never did. They were glad enough to get anyone to be a tide-waiter\nin those days, any white man I mean, and they didn't ask questions. They\ndidn't care who you were. I was damned glad to get the job, I can tell\nyou, I was about broke to the wide when they took me on. I only took it\ntill I could get something better, but I stayed on, it suited me, I\nwanted to make money and I found out that a tide-waiter could make a\npacket if he knew the right way to go about it. I was with the Chinese\nCustoms for the best part of twenty-five years and when I came away I\nwouldn't mind betting that lots of commissioners would have been glad to\nhave the money I had.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave me a sly, mean look. I had an inkling of what he meant. But\nthere was a point on which I was willing to be reassured; if he was\ngoing to ask me for a hundred piastres (I was resigned to that sum now)\nI thought I might just as well take the blow at once.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hope you kept it,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You bet I did. I invested all my money in Shanghai and when I left\nChina I put it all in American railway bonds. Safety first is my motto.\nI know too much about crooks to take any risks myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI liked that remark, so I asked him if he wouldn't stay and have\nluncheon with me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I don't think I will. I don't eat much tiffin and anyway my chow's\nwaiting for me at home. I think I'll be getting along.\" He got up and he\ntowered over me. \"But look here, why don't you come along this evening\nand see my place? I've married a Haiphong girl. Got a baby too. It's not\noften I get a chance of talking to anyone about London. You'd better not\ncome to dinner. We only eat native food and I don't suppose you'd care\nfor that. Come along about nine, will you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had already told him that I was leaving Haiphong next day. He asked\nthe boy to bring him a piece of paper so that he might write down his\naddress. He wrote laboriously in the hand of a boy of fourteen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell the porter to explain to your rickshaw boy where it is. I'm on the\nsecond floor. There's no bell. Just knock. Well, see you later.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe walked out and I went in to luncheon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter dinner I called a rickshaw and with the porter's help made the boy\nunderstand where I wanted to go. I found presently that he was taking me\nalong the curved canal the houses of which had looked to me so like a\nfaded Victorian water-colour; he stopped at one of them and pointed to\nthe door. It looked so shabby and the neighbourhood was so squalid that\nI hesitated, thinking he had made a mistake. It seemed unlikely that\nGrosely could live so far in the native quarter and in a house so\nbedraggled. I told the rickshaw boy to wait and pushing open the door\nsaw a dark staircase in front of me. There was no one about and the\nstreet was empty. It might have been the small hours of the morning. I\nstruck a match and fumbled my way upstairs; on the second floor I struck\nanother match and saw a large brown door in front of me. I knocked and\nin a moment it was opened by a little Tonkinese woman holding a candle.\nShe was dressed in the earth-brown of the poorer classes, with a tight\nlittle black turban on her head; her lips and the skin round them were\nstained red with betel and when she opened her mouth to speak I saw that\nshe had the black teeth and black gums that so disfigure these people.\nShe said something in her native language and then I heard Grosely's\nvoice:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come along in. I was beginning to think you weren't going to turn up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI passed through a little dark ante-chamber and entered a large room\nthat evidently looked on the canal. Grosely was lying on a long chair\nand he raised his length from it as I came in. He was reading the\nHong-Kong papers by the light of a paraffin-lamp that stood on a table\nby his side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sit down,\" he said, \"and put your feet up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There's no reason I should take your chair.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go on. I'll sit on this.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took a kitchen chair and sitting on it put his feet on the end of\nmine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's my wife,\" he said pointing with his thumb at the Tonkinese woman\nwho had followed me into the room. \"And over there in the corner's the\nkid.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI followed his eyes and against the wall, lying on bamboo mats and\ncovered with a blanket, I saw a child sleeping.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Lively little beggar when he's awake. I wish you could have seen him.\nShe's going to have another soon.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI glanced at her and the truth of what he said was apparent. She was\nvery small, with tiny hands and feet, but her face was flat and the skin\nmuddy. She looked sullen, but may only have been shy. She went out of\nthe room and presently came back with a bottle of whisky, two glasses\nand a syphon. I looked round. There was a partition at the back of dark\nunpainted wood, which I suppose shut off another room, and pinned\nagainst the middle of this was a portrait cut out of an illustrated\npaper of John Galsworthy. He looked austere, mild and gentlemanly, and I\nwondered what he did there. The other walls were whitewashed, but the\nwhitewash was dingy and stained. Pinned on to them were pages of\npictures from the <i>Graphic</i> or the <i>Illustrated London News</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I put them up,\" said Grosely, \"I thought they made the place look\nhomelike.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What made you put up Galsworthy? Do you read his books.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I didn't know he wrote books. I liked his face.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere were one or two torn and shabby rattan mats on the floor and in a\ncorner a great pile of the <i>Hong-Kong Times</i>. The only furniture\nconsisted of a wash-hand stand, two or three kitchen chairs, a table or\ntwo and a large teak native bed. It was cheerless and sordid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not a bad little place, is it?\" said Grosely. \"Suits me all right.\nSometimes I've thought of moving, but I don't suppose I ever shall now.\"\nHe gave a little chuckle. \"I came to Haiphong for forty-eight hours and\nI've been here five years. I was on my way to Shanghai really.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was silent. Having nothing to say I said nothing. Then the little\nTonkinese woman made a remark to him, which I could not of course\nunderstand, and he answered her. He was silent again for a minute or\ntwo, but I thought he looked at me as though he wanted to ask me\nsomething. I did not know why he hesitated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you ever tried smoking opium on your travels in the East?\" he\ninquired at last, casually.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I did once, at Singapore. I thought I'd like to see what it was\nlike.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What happened?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Nothing very thrilling, to tell you the truth. I thought I was going to\nhave the most exquisite emotions. I expected visions, like de Quincey's,\nyou know. The only thing I felt was a kind of physical well-being, the\nsame sort of feeling that you get when you've had a Turkish bath and are\nlying in the cooling room, and then a peculiar activity of mind so that\neverything I thought of seemed extremely clear.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I really felt that two and two are four and there could not be the\nsmallest doubt about it. But next morning--oh God! My head reeled. I was\nas sick as a dog, I was sick all day, I vomited my soul out, and as I\nvomited I said to myself miserably: And there are people who call this\nfun.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGrosely leaned back in his chair and gave a low mirthless laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I expect it was bad stuff. Or you went at it too hard. They saw you\nwere a mug and gave you dregs that had been smoked already. They're\nenough to turn anybody up. Would you like to have another try now? I've\ngot some stuff here that I know's good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I think once was enough for me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"D'you mind if I have a pipe or two? You want it in a climate like this.\nIt keeps you from getting dysentery. And I generally have a bit of a\nsmoke about this time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go ahead,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe spoke again to the woman and she, raising her voice, called out\nsomething in a raucous tone. An answer came from the room behind the\nwooden partition and after a minute or two an old woman came out\ncarrying a little round tray. She was shrivelled and old and when she\nentered gave me an ingratiating smile of her stained mouth. Grosely got\nup and crossed over to the bed and lay on it. The old woman set the tray\ndown on the bed; on it was a spirit-lamp, a pipe, a long needle and a\nlittle round box of opium. She squatted on the bed and Grosely's wife\ngot on it too and sat, her feet tucked up under her, with her back\nagainst the wall. Grosely watched the old woman while she put a little\npellet of the drug on the needle, held it over the flame till it sizzled\nand then plugged it into the pipe. She handed it to him and with a great\nbreath he inhaled it, he held the smoke for a little while and then blew\nit out in a thick grey cloud. He handed her back the pipe and she\nstarted to make another. Nobody spoke. He smoked three pipes in\nsuccession and then sank back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By George, I feel better now. I was feeling all in. She makes a\nwonderful pipe, this old hag. Are you sure you won't have one?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Please yourself. Have some tea then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe spoke to his wife, who scrambled off the bed and went out of the\nroom. Presently she came back with a little china pot of tea and a\ncouple of Chinese bowls.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A lot of people smoke here, you know. It does you no harm if you don't\ndo it to excess. I never smoke more than twenty to twenty-five pipes a\nday. You can go on for years if you limit yourself to that. Some of the\nFrenchmen smoke as many as forty or fifty a day. That's too much. I\nnever do that, except now and then when I feel I want a binge. I'm bound\nto say it's never done me any harm.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe drank our tea, pale and vaguely scented and clean on the palate. Then\nthe old woman made him another pipe and then another. His wife had got\nback on to the bed and soon curling herself up at his feet went to\nsleep. Grosely smoked two or three pipes at a time, and while he was\nsmoking seemed intent upon nothing else, but in the intervals he was\nloquacious. Several times I suggested going, but he would not let me.\nThe hours wore on. Once or twice while he smoked I dozed. He told me all\nabout himself. He went on and on. I spoke only to give him a cue. I\ncannot relate what he told me in his own words. He repeated himself. He\nwas very long-winded and he told me his story confusedly, first a late\nbit, then an early bit, so that I had to arrange the sequence for\nmyself; sometimes I saw that, afraid he had said too much, he held\nsomething back; sometimes he lied and I had to make a guess at the truth\nfrom the smile he gave me or the look in his eyes. He had not the words\nto describe what he had felt, and I had to conjecture his meaning from\nslangy metaphors and hackneyed, vulgar phrases. I kept on asking myself\nwhat his real name was, it was on the tip of my tongue and it irritated\nme not to be able to recall it, though why it should in the least matter\nto me I did not know. He was somewhat suspicious of me at first and I\nsaw that this escapade of his in London and his imprisonment had been\nall these years a tormenting secret. He had always been haunted by the\nfear that sooner or later someone would find out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's funny that even now you shouldn't remember me at the hospital,\" he\nsaid, looking at me shrewdly. \"You must have a rotten memory.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hang it all, it's nearly thirty years ago. Think of the thousands of\npeople I've met since then. There's no reason why I should remember you\nany more than you remember me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's right. I don't suppose there is.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt seemed to reassure him. At last he had smoked enough and the old\nwoman made herself a pipe and smoked it. Then she went over to the mat\non which the child was lying and huddled down beside it. She lay so\nstill that I supposed she had fallen directly asleep. When at last I\nwent I found my boy curled up on the foot-board of the rickshaw in so\ndeep a slumber that I had to shake him. I knew where I was and I wanted\nair and exercise, so I gave him a couple of piastres and told him I\nwould walk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a strange story I carried away with me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was with a sort of horror that I had listened to Grosely, telling me\nof those twenty years he had spent in China. He had made money, I do not\nknow how much, but from the way he talked I should think something\nbetween fifteen and twenty thousand pounds, and for a tide-waiter it was\na fortune. He could not have come by it honestly, and little as I knew\nof the details of his trade, by his sudden reticences, by his leers and\nhints I guessed that there was no base transaction that, if it was made\nworth his while, he jibbed at. I suppose that nothing paid him better\nthan smuggling opium, and his position gave him the opportunity to do\nthis with safety and profit. I understood that his superior officers had\noften had their suspicions of him, but had never been able to get such\nproof of his malpractices as to justify them in taking any steps. They\ncontented themselves with moving him from one port to another, but that\ndid not disturb him; they watched him, but he was too clever for them. I\nsaw that he was divided between the fear of telling me too much to his\ndiscredit and the desire to boast of his own astuteness. He prided\nhimself on the confidence the Chinese had placed in him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They knew they could trust me,\" he said, \"and it gave me a pull. I\nnever double-crossed a Chinaman once.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe thought filled him with the complacency of the honest man. The\nChinese discovered that he was keen on curios and they got in the habit\nof giving him bits or bringing him things to buy; he never made\nenquiries how they had come by them and he bought them cheap. When he\nhad got a good lot he sent them to Peking and sold them at a handsome\nprofit. I remembered how he had started his commercial career by buying\nthings at auctions and pawning them. For twenty years by shabby shift\nand petty dishonesty he added pound to pound, and everything he made he\ninvested in Shanghai. He lived penuriously, saving half his pay; he\nnever went on leave because he did not want to waste his money, he would\nnot have anything to do with the Chinese women, he wanted to keep\nhimself free from any entanglement; he did not drink. He was consumed by\none ambition, to save enough to be able to go back to England and live\nthe life from which he had been snatched as a boy. That was the only\nthing he wanted. He lived in China as though in a dream; he paid no\nattention to the life around him; its colour and strangeness, its\npossibilities of pleasure, meant nothing to him. There was always before\nhim the mirage of London, the Criterion Bar, himself standing with his\nfoot on the rail, the promenade at the Empire and the Pavilion, the\npicked-up harlot, the serio-comic at the music-hall and the musical\ncomedy at the Gaiety. This was life and love and adventure. This was\nromance. This was what he yearned for with all his heart. There was\nsurely something impressive in the way in which during all those years\nhe had lived like an anchorite with that one end in view of leading\nagain a life that was so vulgar. It showed character.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You see,\" he said to me, \"even if I'd been able to get back to England\non leave I wouldn't have gone. I didn't want to go till I could go for\ngood. And then I wanted to do the thing in style.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe saw himself putting on evening clothes every night and going out with\na gardenia in his buttonhole, and he saw himself going to the Derby in a\nlong coat and a brown hat and a pair of opera glasses slung over his\nshoulder. He saw himself giving the girls a look over and picking out\nthe one he fancied. He made up his mind that on the night he arrived in\nLondon he would get blind, he hadn't been drunk for twenty years; he\ncouldn't afford to in his job, you had to keep your wits about you. He'd\ntake care not to get drunk on the ship on the way home. He'd wait till\nhe got to London. What a night he'd have! He thought of it for twenty\nyears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI do not know why Grosely left the Chinese Customs, whether the place\nwas getting too hot for him, whether he had reached the end of his\nservice or whether he had amassed the sum he had fixed. But at last he\nsailed. He went second-class; he did not intend to start spending money\ntill he reached London. He took rooms in Jermyn Street, he had always\nwanted to live there, and he went straight to a tailor's and ordered\nhimself an outfit. Slap up. Then he had a look round the town. It was\ndifferent from how he remembered it, there was much more traffic and he\nfelt confused and a little at sea. He went to the Criterion and found\nthere was no longer a bar where he had been used to lounge and drink.\nThere was a restaurant in Leicester Square where he had been in the\nhabit of dining when he was in funds, but he could not find it; he\nsupposed it had been torn down. He went to the Pavilion, but there were\nno women there; he was rather disgusted and went on to the Empire, he\nfound they had done away with the Promenade. It was rather a blow. He\ncould not quite make it out. Well, anyhow, he must be prepared for\nchanges in twenty years, and if he couldn't do anything else he could\nget drunk. He had had fever several times in China and the change of\nclimate had brought it on again, he wasn't feeling any too well, and\nafter four or five drinks he was glad to go to bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat first day was only a sample of many that followed it. Everything\nwent wrong. Grosely's voice grew peevish and bitter as he told me how\none thing and another had failed him. The old places were gone, the\npeople were different, he found it hard to make friends, he was\nstrangely lonely; he had never expected that in a great city like\nLondon. That's what was wrong with it, London had become too big, it\nwasn't the jolly, intimate place it had been in the early nineties. It\nhad gone to pieces. He picked up a few girls, but they weren't as nice\nas the girls he had known before, they weren't the fun they used to be,\nand he grew dimly conscious that they thought him a rum sort of cove. He\nwas only just over forty and they looked upon him as an old man. When he\ntried to cotton on to a lot of young fellows standing round a bar they\ngave him the cold shoulder. Anyway, these young fellows didn't know how\nto drink. He'd show them. He got soused every night, it was the only\nthing to do in that damned place, but, by Jove, it made him feel rotten\nnext day. He supposed it was the climate of China. When he was a medical\nstudent he could drink a bottle of whisky every night and be as fresh as\na daisy in the morning. He began to think more about China. All sorts of\nthings that he never knew he had noticed came back to him. It wasn't a\nbad life he'd led there. Perhaps he'd been a fool to keep away from\nthose Chinese girls, they were pretty little things some of them, and\nthey didn't put on the airs these English girls did. One could have a\ndamned good time in China if one had the money he had. One could keep a\nChinese girl and get into the club, and there'd be a lot of nice fellows\nto drink with and play bridge with and billiards. He remembered the\nChinese shops and all the row in the streets and the coolies carrying\nloads and the ports with the junks in them and the rivers with pagodas\non the banks. It was funny, he never thought much of China while he was\nthere and now--well, he couldn't get it out of his mind. It obsessed\nhim. He began to think that London was no place for a white man. It had\njust gone to the dogs, that was the long and short of it, and one day\nthe thought came to him that perhaps it would be a good thing if he went\nback to China. Of course it was silly, he'd worked like a slave for\ntwenty years to be able to have a good time in London, and it was absurd\nto go and live in China. With his money he ought to be able to have a\ngood time anywhere. But somehow he couldn't think of anything else but\nChina. One day he went to the pictures and saw a scene at Shanghai. That\nsettled it. He was fed up with London. He hated it. He was going to get\nout and this time he'd get out for good. He had been home a year and a\nhalf, and it seemed longer to him than all his twenty years in the East.\nHe took a passage on a French boat sailing from Marseilles, and when he\nsaw the coast of Europe sink into the sea he heaved a great sigh of\nrelief. When they got to Suez and he felt the first touch of the East he\nknew he had done the right thing. Europe was finished. The East was the\nonly place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went ashore at Djibouti and again at Colombo and Singapore, but\nthough the ship stopped for two days at Saigon he remained on board\nthere. He'd been drinking a good deal and he was feeling a bit under the\nweather. But when they reached Haiphong, where they were staying for\nforty-eight hours, he thought he might just as well have a look at it.\nThat was the last stopping-place before they got to China. He was bound\nfor Shanghai. When he got there he meant to go to a hotel and look\naround a bit and then get hold of a girl and a place of his own. He\nwould buy a pony or two and race. He'd soon make friends. In the East\nthey weren't so stiff and stand-offish as they were in London. Going\nashore, he dined at the hotel and after dinner got into a rickshaw and\ntold the boy he wanted a woman. The boy took him to the shabby tenement\nin which I had sat for so many hours and there were the old woman and\nthe girl who was now the mother of his child. After a while the old\nwoman asked him if he wouldn't like to smoke. He had never tried opium,\nhe had always been frightened of it, but now he didn't see why he\nshouldn't have a go. He was feeling good that night and the girl was a\njolly cuddlesome little thing; she was rather like a Chinese girl, small\nand pretty, like an idol. Well, he had a pipe or two, and he began to\nfeel very happy and comfortable. He stayed all night. He didn't sleep.\nHe just lay, feeling very restful, and thought about things.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I stopped there till my ship went on to Hong-Kong,\" he said. \"And when\nshe left I just stopped on.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How about your luggage?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor I am perhaps unworthily interested in the manner people combine\npractical details with the ideal aspects of life. When in a novel\npenniless lovers drive in a long, swift racing car over the distant\nhills I have always a desire to know how they managed to pay for it; and\nI have often asked myself how the characters of Henry James in the\nintervals of subtly examining their situation coped with the\nphysiological necessities of their bodies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I only had a trunk full of clothes, I was never one to want much more\nthan I stood up in, and I went down with the girl in a rickshaw to fetch\nit. I only meant to stay on till the next boat came through. You see, I\nwas so near China here I thought I'd wait a bit and get used to things,\nif you understand what I mean, before I went on.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI did. Those last words of his revealed him to me. I knew that on the\nthreshold of China his courage had failed him. England had been such a\nterrible disappointment that now he was afraid to put China to the test\ntoo. If that failed him he had nothing. For years England had been like\na mirage in the desert. But when he had yielded to the attraction, those\nshining pools and the palm trees and the green grass were nothing but\nthe rolling sandy dunes. He had China, and so long as he never saw it\nagain he kept it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Somehow I stayed on. You know, you'd be surprised how quickly the days\npass. I don't seem to have time to do half the things I want to. After\nall I'm comfortable here. The old woman makes a damned good pipe, and\nshe's a jolly little girl, my girl, and then there's the kid. A lively\nyoung beggar. If you're happy somewhere what's the good of going\nsomewhere else?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And are you happy here?\" I asked him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI looked round that large bare sordid room. There was no comfort in it\nand not one of the little personal things that one would have thought\nmight have given him the feeling of home. Grosely had taken on this\nequivocal little apartment, which served as a house of assignation and\nas a place for Europeans to smoke opium in, with the old woman who kept\nit, just as it was, and he camped, rather than lived, there still as\nthough next day he would pack his traps and go. After a little while he\nanswered my question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've never been so happy in my life. I often think I'll go on to\nShanghai some day, but I don't suppose I ever shall. And God knows, I\nnever want to see England again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Aren't you awfully lonely sometimes for people to talk to?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No. Sometimes a Chinese tramp comes in with an English skipper or a\nScotch engineer, and then I go on board and we have a talk about old\ntimes. There's an old fellow here, a Frenchman who was in the Customs,\nand he speaks English; I go and see him sometimes. But the fact is I\ndon't want anybody very much. I think a lot. It gets on my nerves when\npeople come between me and my thoughts. I'm not a big smoker, you know,\nI just have a pipe or two in the morning to settle my stomach, but I\ndon't really smoke till night. Then I think.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What d'you think about?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, all sorts of things. Sometimes about London and what it was like\nwhen I was a boy. But mostly about China. I think of the good times I\nhad and the way I made my money, and I remember the fellows I used to\nknow, and the Chinese. I had some narrow squeaks now and then, but I\nalways came through all right. And I wonder what the girls would have\nbeen like that I might have had. Pretty little things. I'm sorry now I\ndidn't keep one or two. It's a great country, China; I love those shops,\nwith an old fellow sitting on his heels smoking a water-pipe, and all\nthe shop-signs. And the temples. By George, that's the place for a man\nto live in. There's life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe mirage shone before his eyes. The illusion held him. He was happy. I\nwondered what would be his end. Well, that was not yet. For the first\ntime in his life perhaps he held the present in his hand.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nOutside on the quay the sun beat fiercely. A stream of motors, lorries\nand buses, private cars and hirelings, sped up and down the crowded\nthoroughfare, and every chauffeur blew his horn; rickshaws threaded\ntheir nimble path amid the throng, and the panting coolies found breath\nto yell at one another; coolies, carrying heavy bales, sidled along with\ntheir quick jog-trot and shouted to the passer-by to make way; itinerant\nvendors proclaimed their wares. Singapore is the meeting-place of a\nhundred peoples; and men of all colours, black Tamils, yellow Chinks,\nbrown Malays, Armenians, Jews and Bengalis, called to one another in\nraucous tones. But inside the office of Messrs. Ripley, Joyce and Naylor\nit was pleasantly cool; it was dark after the dusty glitter of the\nstreet and agreeably quiet after its unceasing din. Mr. Joyce sat in his\nprivate room, at the table, with an electric fan turned full on him. He\nwas leaning back, his elbows on the arms of the chair, with the tips of\nthe outstretched fingers of one hand resting neatly against the tips of\nthe outstretched fingers of the other. His gaze rested on the battered\nvolumes of the Law Reports which stood on a long shelf in front of him.\nOn the top of a cupboard were square boxes of japanned tin, on which\nwere painted the names of various clients.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a knock at the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA Chinese clerk, very neat in his white ducks, opened it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Crosbie is here, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe spoke beautiful English, accenting each word with precision, and Mr.\nJoyce had often wondered at the extent of his vocabulary. Ong Chi Seng\nwas a Cantonese, and he had studied law at Gray's Inn. He was spending a\nyear or two with Messrs. Ripley, Joyce and Naylor in order to prepare\nhimself for practice on his own account. He was industrious, obliging,\nand of exemplary character.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Show him in,\" said Mr. Joyce.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe rose to shake hands with his visitor and asked him to sit down. The\nlight fell on him as he did so. The face of Mr. Joyce remained in\nshadow. He was by nature a silent man, and now he looked at Robert\nCrosbie for quite a minute without speaking. Crosbie was a big fellow,\nwell over six feet high, with broad shoulders, and muscular. He was a\nrubber-planter, hard with the constant exercise of walking over the\nestate, and with the tennis which was his relaxation when the day's work\nwas over. He was deeply sunburned. His hairy hands, his feet in clumsy\nboots were enormous, and Mr. Joyce found himself thinking that a blow of\nthat great fist would easily kill the fragile Tamil. But there was no\nfierceness in his blue eyes; they were confiding and gentle; and his\nface, with its big, undistinguished features, was open, frank and\nhonest. But at this moment it bore a look of deep distress. It was drawn\nand haggard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You look as though you hadn't had much sleep the last night or two,\"\nsaid Mr. Joyce.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I haven't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce noticed now the old felt hat, with its broad double brim,\nwhich Crosbie had placed on the table; and then his eyes travelled to\nthe khaki shorts he wore, showing his red hairy thighs, the tennis shirt\nopen at the neck, without a tie, and the dirty khaki jacket with the\nends of the sleeves turned up. He looked as though he had just come in\nfrom a long tramp among the rubber trees. Mr. Joyce gave a slight frown.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You must pull yourself together, you know. You must keep your head.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I'm all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you seen your wife to-day?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I'm to see her this afternoon. You know, it is a damned shame that\nthey should have arrested her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think they had to do that,\" Mr. Joyce answered in his level, soft\ntone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have thought they'd have let her out on bail.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a very serious charge.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is damnable. She did what any decent woman would do in her place.\nOnly, nine women out of ten wouldn't have the pluck. Leslie's the best\nwoman in the world. She wouldn't hurt a fly. Why, hang it all, man, I've\nbeen married to her for twelve years, do you think I don't know her?\nGod, if I'd got hold of the man I'd have wrung his neck, I'd have killed\nhim without a moment's hesitation. So would you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear fellow, everybody's on your side. No one has a good word to say\nfor Hammond. We're going to get her off. I don't suppose either the\nassessors or the judge will go into court without having already made up\ntheir minds to bring in a verdict of not guilty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The whole thing's a farce,\" said Crosbie violently. \"She ought never to\nhave been arrested in the first place, and then it's terrible, after all\nthe poor girl's gone through, to subject her to the ordeal of a trial.\nThere's not a soul I've met since I've been in Singapore, man or woman,\nwho hasn't told me that Leslie was absolutely justified. I think it's\nawful to keep her in prison all these weeks.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The law is the law. After all, she confesses that she killed the man.\nIt is terrible, and I'm dreadfully sorry for both you and for her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't matter a hang,\" interrupted Crosbie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But the fact remains that murder has been committed, and in a civilised\ncommunity a trial is inevitable.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it murder to exterminate noxious vermin? She shot him as she would\nhave shot a mad dog.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce leaned back again in his chair and once more placed the tips\nof his ten fingers together. The little construction he formed looked\nlike the skeleton of a roof. He was silent for a moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should be wanting in my duty as your legal adviser,\" he said at last,\nin an even voice, looking at his client with his cool, brown eyes, \"if I\ndid not tell you that there is one point which causes me just a little\nanxiety. If your wife had only shot Hammond once, the whole thing would\nbe absolutely plain sailing. Unfortunately she fired six times.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Her explanation is perfectly simple. In the circumstances anyone would\nhave done the same.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say,\" said Mr. Joyce, \"and of course I think the explanation is\nvery reasonable. But it's no good closing our eyes to the facts. It's\nalways a good plan to put yourself in another man's place, and I can't\ndeny that if I were prosecuting for the Crown that is the point on which\nI should centre my enquiry.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear fellow, that's perfectly idiotic.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce shot a sharp glance at Robert Crosbie. The shadow of a smile\nhovered over his shapely lips. Crosbie was a good fellow, but he could\nhardly be described as intelligent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say it's of no importance,\" answered the lawyer, \"I just thought\nit was a point worth mentioning. You haven't got very long to wait now,\nand when it's all over I recommend you to go off somewhere with your\nwife on a trip, and forget all about it. Even though we are almost dead\ncertain to get an acquittal, a trial of that sort is anxious work, and\nyou'll both want a rest.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor the first time Crosbie smiled, and his smile strangely changed his\nface. You forgot the uncouthness and saw only the goodness of his soul.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I shall want it more than Leslie. She's borne up wonderfully.\nBy God, there's a plucky little woman for you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I've been very much struck by her self-control,\" said the lawyer.\n\"I should never have guessed that she was capable of such\ndetermination.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis duties as her counsel had made it necessary for him to have a good\nmany interviews with Mrs. Crosbie since her arrest. Though things had\nbeen made as easy as could be for her, the fact remained that she was in\ngaol, awaiting her trial for murder, and it would not have been\nsurprising if her nerves had failed her. She appeared to bear her ordeal\nwith composure. She read a great deal, took such exercise as was\npossible, and by favour of the authorities worked at the pillow lace\nwhich had always formed the entertainment of her long hours of leisure.\nWhen Mr. Joyce saw her, she was neatly dressed in cool, fresh, simple\nfrocks, her hair was carefully arranged, and her nails were manicured.\nHer manner was collected. She was able even to jest upon the little\ninconveniences of her position. There was something casual about the way\nin which she spoke of the tragedy, which suggested to Mr. Joyce that\nonly her good breeding prevented her from finding something a trifle\nludicrous in a situation which was eminently serious. It surprised him,\nfor he had never thought that she had a sense of humour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe had known her off and on for a good many years. When she paid visits\nto Singapore she generally came to dine with his wife and himself, and\nonce or twice she had passed a week-end with them at their bungalow by\nthe sea. His wife had spent a fortnight with her on the estate, and had\nmet Geoffrey Hammond several times. The two couples had been on\nfriendly, if not on intimate, terms, and it was on this account that\nRobert Crosbie had rushed over to Singapore immediately after the\ncatastrophe and begged Mr. Joyce to take charge personally of his\nunhappy wife's defence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe story she told him the first time he saw her she had never varied in\nthe smallest detail. She told it as coolly then, a few hours after the\ntragedy, as she told it now. She told it connectedly, in a level, even\nvoice, and her only sign of confusion was when a slight colour came into\nher cheeks as she described one or two of its incidents. She was the\nlast woman to whom one would have expected such a thing to happen. She\nwas in the early thirties, a fragile creature, neither short nor tall,\nand graceful rather than pretty. Her wrists and ankles were very\ndelicate, but she was extremely thin, and you could see the bones of her\nhands through the white skin, and the veins were large and blue. Her\nface was colourless, slightly sallow, and her lips were pale. You did\nnot notice the colour of her eyes. She had a great deal of light brown\nhair, and it had a slight natural wave; it was the sort of hair that\nwith a little touching-up would have been very pretty, but you could not\nimagine that Mrs. Crosbie would think of resorting to any such device.\nShe was a quiet, pleasant, unassuming woman. Her manner was engaging,\nand if she was not very popular it was because she suffered from a\ncertain shyness. This was comprehensible enough, for the planter's life\nis lonely, and in her own house, with people she knew, she was in her\nquiet way charming. Mrs. Joyce, after her fortnight's stay, had told her\nhusband that Leslie was a very agreeable hostess. There was more in her,\nshe said, than people thought; and when you came to know her you were\nsurprised how much she had read and how entertaining she could be.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was the last woman in the world to commit murder.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce dismissed Robert Crosbie with such reassuring words as he\ncould find and, once more alone in his office, turned over the pages of\nthe brief. But it was a mechanical action, for all its details were\nfamiliar to him. The case was the sensation of the day, and it was\ndiscussed in all the clubs, at all the dinner tables, up and down the\nPeninsula, from Singapore to Penang. The facts that Mrs. Crosbie gave\nwere simple. Her husband had gone to Singapore on business, and she was\nalone for the night. She dined by herself, late, at a quarter to nine,\nand after dinner sat in the sitting-room working at her lace. It opened\non the verandah. There was no one in the bungalow, for the servants had\nretired to their own quarters at the back of the compound. She was\nsurprised to hear a step on the gravel path in the garden, a booted\nstep, which suggested a white man rather than a native, for she had not\nheard a motor drive up, and she could not imagine who could be coming to\nsee her at that time of night. Someone ascended the few stairs that led\nup to the bungalow, walked across the verandah, and appeared at the door\nof the room in which she sat. At the first moment she did not recognise\nthe visitor. She sat with a shaded lamp, and he stood with his back to\nthe darkness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"May I come in?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe did not even recognise the voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is it?\" she asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe worked with spectacles, and she took them off as she spoke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Geoff. Hammond.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course. Come in and have a drink.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe rose and shook hands with him cordially. She was a little surprised\nto see him, for though he was a neighbour neither she nor Robert had\nbeen lately on very intimate terms with him, and she had not seen him\nfor some weeks. He was the manager of a rubber estate nearly eight miles\nfrom theirs, and she wondered why he had chosen this late hour to come\nand see them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Robert's away,\" she said. \"He had to go to Singapore for the night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPerhaps he thought his visit called for some explanation, for he said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry. I felt rather lonely to-night, so I thought I'd just come\nalong and see how you were getting on.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How on earth did you come? I never heard a car.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I left it down the road. I thought you might both be in bed and\nasleep.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis was natural enough. The planter gets up at dawn in order to take\nthe roll-call of the workers, and soon after dinner he is glad to go to\nbed. Hammond's car was in point of fact found next day a quarter of a\nmile from the bungalow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSince Robert was away there was no whisky and soda in the room. Leslie\ndid not call the boy, who was probably asleep, but fetched it herself.\nHer guest mixed himself a drink and filled his pipe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGeoff. Hammond had a host of friends in the colony. He was at this time\nin the late thirties, but he had come out as a lad. He had been one of\nthe first to volunteer on the outbreak of war, and had done very well. A\nwound in the knee caused him to be invalided out of the army after two\nyears, but he returned to the Federated Malay States with a D.S.O. and\nan M.C. He was one of the best billiard-players in the colony. He had\nbeen a beautiful dancer and a fine tennis-player, but though able no\nlonger to dance, and his tennis, with a stiff knee, was not so good as\nit had been, he had the gift of popularity and was universally liked. He\nwas a tall, good-looking fellow, with attractive blue eyes and a fine\nhead of black, curling hair. Old stagers said his only fault was that he\nwas too fond of the girls, and after the catastrophe they shook their\nheads and vowed that they had always known this would get him into\ntrouble.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe began now to talk to Leslie about the local affairs, the forthcoming\nraces in Singapore, the price of rubber, and his chances of killing a\ntiger which had been lately seen in the neighbourhood. She was anxious\nto finish by a certain date the piece of lace on which she was working,\nfor she wanted to send it home for her mother's birthday, and so put on\nher spectacles again, and drew towards her chair the little table on\nwhich stood the pillow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wish you wouldn't wear those great horn-spectacles,\" he said. \"I\ndon't know why a pretty woman should do her best to look plain.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was a trifle taken aback at this remark. He had never used that tone\nwith her before. She thought the best thing was to make light of it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have no pretensions to being a raving beauty, you know, and if you\nask me point-blank, I'm bound to tell you that I don't care two pins if\nyou think me plain or not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think you're plain. I think you're awfully pretty.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Sweet of you,\" she answered, ironically. \"But in that case I can only\nthink you half-witted.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe chuckled. But he rose from his chair and sat down in another by her\nside.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not going to have the face to deny that you have the prettiest\nhands in the world,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe made a gesture as though to take one of them. She gave him a little\ntap.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be an idiot. Sit down where you were before and talk sensibly, or\nelse I shall send you home.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not move.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't you know that I'm awfully in love with you?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe remained quite cool.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't. I don't believe it for a minute, and even if it were true I\ndon't want you to say it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was the more surprised at what he was saying, since during the seven\nyears she had known him he had never paid her any particular attention.\nWhen he came back from the war they had seen a good deal of one another,\nand once when he was ill Robert had gone over and brought him back to\ntheir bungalow in his car. He had stayed with them for a fortnight. But\ntheir interests were dissimilar, and the acquaintance had never ripened\ninto friendship. For the last two or three years they had seen little of\nhim. Now and then he came over to play tennis, now and then they met him\nat some planter's who was giving a party, but it often happened that\nthey did not set eyes on him for a month at a time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow he took another whisky and soda. Leslie wondered if he had been\ndrinking before. There was something odd about him, and it made her a\ntrifle uneasy. She watched him help himself with disapproval.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wouldn't drink any more if I were you,\" she said, good-humouredly\nstill.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe emptied his glass and put it down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think I'm talking to you like this because I'm drunk?\" he asked\nabruptly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is the most obvious explanation, isn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, it's a lie. I've loved you ever since I first knew you. I've held\nmy tongue as long as I could, and now it's got to come out. I love you,\nI love you, I love you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe rose and carefully put aside the pillow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good-night,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm not going now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last she began to lose her temper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But, you poor fool, don't you know that I've never loved anyone but\nRobert, and even if I didn't love Robert you're the last man I should\ncare for.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do I care? Robert's away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you don't go away this minute I shall call the boys, and have you\nthrown out.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're out of earshot.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was very angry now. She made a movement as though to go on to the\nverandah, from which the house-boy would certainly hear her, but he\nseized her arm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me go,\" she cried furiously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not much. I've got you now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe opened her mouth and called \"Boy, boy,\" but with a quick gesture he\nput his hand over it. Then before she knew what he was about he had\ntaken her in his arms and was kissing her passionately. She struggled,\nturning her lips away from his burning mouth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, no, no,\" she cried. \"Leave me alone. I won't.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe grew confused about what happened then. All that had been said\nbefore she remembered accurately, but now his words assailed her ears\nthrough a mist of horror and fear. He seemed to plead for her love. He\nbroke into violent protestations of passion. And all the time he held\nher in his tempestuous embrace. She was helpless, for he was a strong,\npowerful man, and her arms were pinioned to her sides; her struggles\nwere unavailing, and she felt herself grow weaker; she was afraid she\nwould faint, and his hot breath on her face made her feel desperately\nsick. He kissed her mouth, her eyes, her cheeks, her hair. The pressure\nof his arms was killing her. He lifted her off her feet. She tried to\nkick him, but he only held her more closely. He was carrying her now. He\nwasn't speaking any more, but she knew that his face was pale and his\neyes hot with desire. He was taking her into the bedroom. He was no\nlonger a civilised man, but a savage. And as he ran he stumbled against\na table which was in the way. His stiff knee made him a little awkward\non his feet, and with the burden of the woman in his arms he fell. In a\nmoment she had snatched herself away from him. She ran round the sofa.\nHe was up in a flash, and flung himself towards her. There was a\nrevolver on the desk. She was not a nervous woman, but Robert was to be\naway for the night, and she had meant to take it into her room when she\nwent to bed. That was why it happened to be there. She was frantic with\nterror now. She did not know what she was doing. She heard a report. She\nsaw Hammond stagger. He gave a cry. He said something, she didn't know\nwhat. He lurched out of the room on to the verandah. She was in a frenzy\nnow, she was beside herself, she followed him out, yes, that was it, she\nmust have followed him out, though she remembered nothing of it, she\nfollowed firing automatically, shot after shot, till the six chambers\nwere empty. Hammond fell down on the floor of the verandah. He crumpled\nup into a bloody heap.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen the boys, startled by the reports, rushed up, they found her\nstanding over Hammond with the revolver still in her hand and Hammond\nlifeless. She looked at them for a moment without speaking. They stood\nin a frightened, huddled bunch. She let the revolver fall from her hand,\nand without a word turned and went into the sitting-room. They watched\nher go into her bedroom and turn the key in the lock. They dared not\ntouch the dead body, but looked at it with terrified eyes, talking\nexcitedly to one another in undertones. Then the head-boy collected\nhimself; he had been with them for many years, he was Chinese and a\nlevel-headed fellow. Robert had gone into Singapore on his motor-cycle,\nand the car stood in the garage. He told the seis to get it out; they\nmust go at once to the Assistant District Officer and tell him what had\nhappened. He picked up the revolver and put it in his pocket. The\nA.D.O., a man called Withers, lived on the outskirts of the nearest\ntown, which was about thirty-five miles away. It took them an hour and a\nhalf to reach him. Everyone was asleep, and they had to rouse the boys.\nPresently Withers came out and they told him their errand. The head-boy\nshowed him the revolver in proof of what he said. The A.D.O. went into\nhis room to dress, sent for his car, and in a little while was following\nthem back along the deserted road. The dawn was just breaking as he\nreached the Crosbies' bungalow. He ran up the steps of the verandah, and\nstopped short as he saw Hammond's body lying where he fell. He touched\nthe face. It was quite cold.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where's mem?\" he asked the house-boy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Chinese pointed to the bedroom. Withers went to the door and\nknocked. There was no answer. He knocked again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Crosbie,\" he called.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who is it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Withers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was another pause. Then the door was unlocked and slowly opened.\nLeslie stood before him. She had not been to bed, and wore the tea-gown\nin which she had dined. She stood and looked silently at the A.D.O.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Your house-boy fetched me,\" he said. \"Hammond. What have you done?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He tried to rape me, and I shot him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My God. I say, you'd better come out here. You must tell me exactly\nwhat happened.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not now. I can't. You must give me time. Send for my husband.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWithers was a young man, and he did not know exactly what to do in an\nemergency which was so out of the run of his duties. Leslie refused to\nsay anything till at last Robert arrived. Then she told the two men the\nstory, from which since then, though she had repeated it over and over\nagain, she had never in the slightest degree diverged.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe point to which Mr. Joyce recurred was the shooting. As a lawyer he\nwas bothered that Leslie had fired not once, but six times, and the\nexamination of the dead man showed that four of the shots had been fired\nclose to the body. One might almost have thought that when the man fell\nshe stood over him and emptied the contents of the revolver into him.\nShe confessed that her memory, so accurate for all that had preceded,\nfailed her here. Her mind was blank. It pointed to an uncontrollable\nfury; but uncontrollable fury was the last thing you would have expected\nfrom this quiet and demure woman. Mr. Joyce had known her a good many\nyears, and had always thought her an unemotional person; during the\nweeks that had passed since the tragedy her composure had been amazing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce shrugged his shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The fact is, I suppose,\" he reflected, \"that you can never tell what\nhidden possibilities of savagery there are in the most respectable of\nwomen.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a knock at the door.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Chinese clerk entered and closed the door behind him. He closed it\ngently, with deliberation, but decidedly, and advanced to the table at\nwhich Mr. Joyce was sitting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"May I trouble you, sir, for a few words private conversation?\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe elaborate accuracy with which the clerk expressed himself always\nfaintly amused Mr. Joyce, and now he smiled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's no trouble, Chi Seng,\" he replied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The matter on which I desire to speak to you, sir, is delicate and\nconfidential.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Fire away.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce met his clerk's shrewd eyes. As usual Ong Chi Seng was dressed\nin the height of local fashion. He wore very shiny patent-leather shoes\nand gay silk socks. In his black tie was a pearl and ruby pin, and on\nthe fourth finger of his left hand a diamond ring. From the pocket of\nhis neat white coat protruded a gold fountain pen and a gold pencil. He\nwore a gold wrist-watch, and on the bridge of his nose invisible\npince-nez. He gave a little cough.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The matter has to do with the case R. <i>v.</i> Crosbie, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A circumstance has come to my knowledge, sir, which seems to me to put\na different complexion on it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What circumstance?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It has come to my knowledge, sir, that there is a letter in existence\nfrom the defendant to the unfortunate victim of the tragedy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shouldn't be at all surprised. In the course of the last seven years\nI have no doubt that Mrs. Crosbie often had occasion to write to Mr.\nHammond.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce had a high opinion of his clerk's intelligence and his words\nwere designed to conceal his thoughts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is very probable, sir. Mrs. Crosbie must have communicated with\nthe deceased frequently, to invite him to dine with her for example, or\nto propose a tennis game. That was my first thought when the matter was\nbrought to my notice. This letter, however, was written on the day of\nthe late Mr. Hammond's death.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce did not flicker an eyelash. He continued to look at Ong Chi\nSeng with the smile of faint amusement with which he generally talked to\nhim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who has told you this?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The circumstances were brought to my knowledge, sir, by a friend of\nmine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce knew better than to insist.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You will no doubt recall, sir, that Mrs. Crosbie has stated that until\nthe fatal night she had had no communication with the deceased for\nseveral weeks.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Have you got the letter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are its contents?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My friend gave me a copy. Would you like to peruse it, sir?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOng Chi Seng took from an inside pocket a bulky wallet. It was filled\nwith papers, Singapore dollar notes and cigarette cards. From the\nconfusion he presently extracted a half-sheet of thin notepaper and\nplaced it before Mr. Joyce. The letter read as follows:--\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n    <i>R. will be away for the night. I absolutely must see you. I\n    shall expect you at eleven. I am desperate, and if you don't\n    come I won't answer for the consequences. Don't drive up.--L.</i>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nIt was written in the flowing hand which the Chinese were taught at the\nforeign schools. The writing, so lacking in character, was oddly\nincongruous with the ominous words.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What makes you think that this note was written by Mrs. Crosbie?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have every confidence in the veracity of my informant, sir,\" replied\nOng Chi Seng. \"And the matter can very easily be put to the proof. Mrs.\nCrosbie will, no doubt, be able to tell you at once whether she wrote\nsuch a letter or not.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSince the beginning of the conversation Mr. Joyce had not taken his eyes\noff the respectable countenance of his clerk. He wondered now if he\ndiscerned in it a faint expression of mockery.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is inconceivable that Mrs. Crosbie should have written such a\nletter,\" said Mr. Joyce.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If that is your opinion, sir, the matter is of course ended. My friend\nspoke to me on the subject only because he thought, as I was in your\noffice, you might like to know of the existence of this letter before a\ncommunication was made to the Deputy Public Prosecutor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who has the original?\" asked Mr. Joyce sharply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOng Chi Seng made no sign that he perceived in this question and its\nmanner a change of attitude.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You will remember, sir, no doubt, that after the death of Mr. Hammond\nit was discovered that he had had relations with a Chinese woman. The\nletter is at present in her possession.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat was one of the things which had turned public opinion most\nvehemently against Hammond. It came to be known that for several months\nhe had had a Chinese woman living in his house.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a moment neither of them spoke. Indeed everything had been said and\neach understood the other perfectly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm obliged to you, Chi Seng. I will give the matter my consideration.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very good, sir. Do you wish me to make a communication to that effect\nto my friend?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say it would be as well if you kept in touch with him,\" Mr.\nJoyce answered with gravity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe clerk noiselessly left the room, shutting the door again with\ndeliberation, and left Mr. Joyce to his reflections. He stared at the\ncopy, in its neat, impersonal writing, of Leslie's letter. Vague\nsuspicions troubled him. They were so disconcerting that he made an\neffort to put them out of his mind. There must be a simple explanation\nof the letter, and Leslie without doubt could give it at once, but, by\nheaven, an explanation was needed. He rose from his chair, put the\nletter in his pocket, and took his topee. When he went out Ong Chi Seng\nwas busily writing at his desk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going out for a few minutes, Chi Seng,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. George Reed is coming by appointment at twelve o'clock, sir. Where\nshall I say you've gone?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce gave him a thin smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You can say that you haven't the least idea.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut he knew perfectly well that Ong Chi Seng was aware that he was going\nto the gaol. Though the crime had been committed in Belanda and the\ntrial was to take place at Belanda Bharu, since there was in the gaol no\nconvenience for the detention of a white woman Mrs. Crosbie had been\nbrought to Singapore.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen she was led into the room in which he waited she held out her thin,\ndistinguished hand, and gave him a pleasant smile. She was as ever\nneatly and simply dressed, and her abundant, pale hair was arranged with\ncare.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wasn't expecting to see you this morning,\" she said, graciously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe might have been in her own house, and Mr. Joyce almost expected to\nhear her call the boy and tell him to bring the visitor a gin pahit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How are you?\" he asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm in the best of health, thank you.\" A flicker of amusement flashed\nacross her eyes. \"This is a wonderful place for a rest cure.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe attendant withdrew and they were left alone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do sit down,\" said Leslie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took a chair. He did not quite know how to begin. She was so cool\nthat it seemed almost impossible to say to her the thing he had come to\nsay. Though she was not pretty there was something agreeable in her\nappearance. She had elegance, but it was the elegance of good breeding\nin which there was nothing of the artifice of society. You had only to\nlook at her to know what sort of people she had and what kind of\nsurroundings she had lived in. Her fragility gave her a singular\nrefinement. It was impossible to associate her with the vaguest idea of\ngrossness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm looking forward to seeing Robert this afternoon,\" she said, in her\ngood-humoured, easy voice. (It was a pleasure to hear her speak, her\nvoice and her accent were so distinctive of her class.) \"Poor dear, it's\nbeen a great trial to his nerves. I'm thankful it'll all be over in a\nfew days.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's only five days now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know. Each morning when I awake I say to myself, 'one less.'\" She\nsmiled then. \"Just as I used to do at school and the holidays were\ncoming.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way, am I right in thinking that you had no communication\nwhatever with Hammond for several weeks before the catastrophe?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm quite positive of that. The last time we met was at a tennis-party\nat the MacFarrens. I don't think I said more than two words to him. They\nhave two courts, you know, and we didn't happen to be in the same sets.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And you haven't written to him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, no.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you quite sure of that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, quite,\" she answered, with a little smile. \"There was nothing I\nshould write to him for except to ask him to dine or to play tennis, and\nI hadn't done either for months.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At one time you'd been on fairly intimate terms with him. How did it\nhappen that you had stopped asking him to anything?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Crosbie shrugged her thin shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"One gets tired of people. We hadn't anything very much in common. Of\ncourse, when he was ill Robert and I did everything we could for him,\nbut the last year or two he'd been quite well, and he was very popular.\nHe had a good many calls on his time, and there didn't seem to be any\nneed to shower invitations upon him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you quite certain that was all?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Crosbie hesitated for a moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I may just as well tell you. It had come to our ears that he was\nliving with a Chinese woman, and Robert said he wouldn't have him in the\nhouse, I had seen her myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce was sitting in a straight-backed arm-chair, resting his chin\non his hand, and his eyes were fixed on Leslie. Was it his fancy that,\nas she made this remark, her black pupils were filled on a sudden, for\nthe fraction of a second, with a dull red light? The effect was\nstartling. Mr. Joyce shifted in his chair. He placed the tips of his ten\nfingers together. He spoke very slowly, choosing his words.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think I should tell you that there is in existence a letter in your\nhandwriting to Geoff. Hammond.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe watched her closely. She made no movement, nor did her face change\ncolour, but she took a noticeable time to reply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In the past I've often sent him little notes to ask him to something or\nother, or to get me something when I knew he was going to Singapore.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This letter asks him to come and see you because Robert was going to\nSingapore.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's impossible. I never did anything of the kind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd better read it for yourself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took it out of his pocket and handed it to her. She gave it a glance\nand with a smile of scorn handed it back to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's not my handwriting.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know, it's said to be an exact copy of the original.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe read the words now, and as she read a horrible change came over her.\nHer colourless face grew dreadful to look at. It turned green. The flesh\nseemed on a sudden to fall away and her skin was tightly stretched over\nthe bones. Her lips receded, showing her teeth, so that she had the\nappearance of making a grimace. She stared at Mr. Joyce with eyes that\nstarted from their sockets. He was looking now at a gibbering death's\nhead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does it mean?\" she whispered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer mouth was so dry that she could utter no more than a hoarse sound.\nIt was no longer a human voice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That is for you to say,\" he answered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't write it. I swear I didn't write it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Be very careful what you say. If the original is in your handwriting it\nwould be useless to deny it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be a forgery.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be difficult to prove that. It would be easy to prove that it\nwas genuine.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA shiver passed through her lean body. But great beads of sweat stood on\nher forehead. She took a handkerchief from her bag and wiped the palms\nof her hands. She glanced at the letter again and gave Mr. Joyce a\nsidelong look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not dated. If I had written it and forgotten all about it, it\nmight have been written years ago. If you'll give me time, I'll try and\nremember the circumstances.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I noticed there was no date. If this letter were in the hands of the\nprosecution they would cross-examine the boys. They would soon find out\nwhether someone took a letter to Hammond on the day of his death.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Crosbie clasped her hands violently and swayed in her chair so that\nhe thought she would faint.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I swear to you that I didn't write that letter.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce was silent for a little while. He took his eyes from her\ndistraught face, and looked down on the floor. He was reflecting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In these circumstances we need not go into the matter further,\" he said\nslowly, at last breaking the silence. \"If the possessor of this letter\nsees fit to place it in the hands of the prosecution you will be\nprepared.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis words suggested that he had nothing more to say to her, but he made\nno movement of departure. He waited. To himself he seemed to wait a very\nlong time. He did not look at Leslie, but he was conscious that she sat\nvery still. She made no sound. At last it was he who spoke.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you have nothing more to say to me I think I'll be getting back to\nmy office.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What would anyone who read the letter be inclined to think that it\nmeant?\" she asked then.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He'd know that you had told a deliberate lie,\" answered Mr. Joyce\nsharply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You have stated definitely that you had had no communication with\nHammond for at least three months.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The whole thing has been a terrible shock to me. The events of that\ndreadful night have been a nightmare. It's not very strange if one\ndetail has escaped my memory.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be unfortunate, when your memory has reproduced so exactly\nevery particular of your interview with Hammond, that you should have\nforgotten so important a point as that he came to see you in the\nbungalow on the night of his death at your express desire.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hadn't forgotten. After what happened I was afraid to mention it. I\nthought you'd none of you believe my story if I admitted that he'd come\nat my invitation. I dare say it was stupid of me; but I lost my head,\nand after I'd said once that I'd had no communication with Hammond I was\nobliged to stick to it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBy now Leslie had recovered her admirable composure, and she met Mr.\nJoyce's appraising glance with candour. Her gentleness was very\ndisarming.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You will be required to explain, then, <i>why</i> you asked Hammond to come\nand see you when Robert was away for the night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe turned her eyes full on the lawyer. He had been mistaken in thinking\nthem insignificant, they were rather fine eyes, and unless he was\nmistaken they were bright now with tears. Her voice had a little break\nin it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was a surprise I was preparing for Robert. His birthday is next\nmonth. I knew he wanted a new gun and you know I'm dreadfully stupid\nabout sporting things. I wanted to talk to Geoff. about it. I thought\nI'd get him to order it for me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Perhaps the terms of the letter are not very clear to your\nrecollection. Will you have another look at it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I don't want to,\" she said quickly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does it seem to you the sort of letter a woman would write to a\nsomewhat distant acquaintance because she wanted to consult him about\nbuying a gun?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say it's rather extravagant and emotional. I do express myself\nlike that, you know. I'm quite prepared to admit it's very silly.\" She\nsmiled. \"And after all, Geoff. Hammond wasn't quite a distant\nacquaintance. When he was ill I'd nursed him like a mother. I asked him\nto come when Robert was away, because Robert wouldn't have him in the\nhouse.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce was tired of sitting so long in the same position. He rose and\nwalked once or twice up and down the room, choosing the words he\nproposed to say; then he learned over the back of the chair in which he\nhad been sitting. He spoke slowly in a tone of deep gravity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mrs. Crosbie, I want to talk to you very, very seriously. This case was\ncomparatively plain sailing. There was only one point which seemed to me\nto require explanation: as far as I could judge, you had fired no less\nthan four shots into Hammond when he was lying on the ground. It was\nhard to accept the possibility that a delicate, frightened, and\nhabitually self-controlled woman, of gentle nature and refined\ninstincts, should have surrendered to an absolutely uncontrolled frenzy.\nBut of course it was admissible. Although Geoffrey Hammond was much\nliked and on the whole thought highly of, I was prepared to prove that\nhe was the sort of man who might be guilty of the crime which in\njustification of your act you accused him of. The fact, which was\ndiscovered after his death, that he had been living with a Chinese woman\ngave us something very definite to go upon. That robbed him of any\nsympathy which might have been felt for him. We made up our minds to\nmake use of the odium which such a connection cast upon him in the minds\nof all respectable people. I told your husband this morning that I was\ncertain of an acquittal, and I wasn't just telling him that to give him\nheart. I do not believe the assessors would have left the court.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey looked into one another's eyes. Mrs. Crosbie was strangely still.\nShe was like a little bird paralysed by the fascination of a snake. He\nwent on in the same quiet tones.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But this letter has thrown an entirely different complexion on the\ncase. I am your legal adviser, I shall represent you in court. I take\nyour story as you tell it me, and I shall conduct your defence according\nto its terms. It may be that I believe your statements, and it may be\nthat I doubt them. The duty of counsel is to persuade the court that the\nevidence placed before it is not such as to justify it in bringing in a\nverdict of guilty, and any private opinion he may have of the guilt or\ninnocence of his client is entirely beside the point.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was astonished to see in Leslie's eyes the flicker of a smile.\nPiqued, he went on somewhat dryly:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're not going to deny that Hammond came to your house at your\nurgent, and I may even say, hysterical invitation?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Crosbie, hesitating for an instant, seemed to consider.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They can prove that the letter was taken to his bungalow by one of the\nhouse-boys. He rode over on his bicycle.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You mustn't expect other people to be stupider than you. The letter\nwill put them on the track of suspicions which have entered nobody's\nhead. I will not tell you what I personally thought when I saw the copy.\nI do not wish you to tell me anything but what is needed to save your\nneck.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Crosbie gave a shrill cry. She sprang to her feet, white with\nterror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't think they'd hang me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If they came to the conclusion that you hadn't killed Hammond in\nself-defence, it would be the duty of the assessors to bring in a\nverdict of guilty. The charge is murder. It would be the duty of the\njudge to sentence you to death.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what can they prove?\" she gasped.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know what they can prove. You know. I don't want to know. But\nif their suspicions are aroused, if they begin to make inquiries, if the\nnatives are questioned--what is it that can be discovered?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe crumpled up suddenly. She fell on the floor before he could catch\nher. She had fainted. He looked round the room for water, but there was\nnone there, and he did not want to be disturbed. He stretched her out on\nthe floor, and kneeling beside her waited for her to recover. When she\nopened her eyes he was disconcerted by the ghastly fear that he saw in\nthem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Keep quite still,\" he said. \"You'll be better in a moment.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You won't let them hang me,\" she whispered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe began to cry, hysterically, while in undertones he sought to quieten\nher.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For goodness sake pull yourself together,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Give me a minute.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHer courage was amazing. He could see the effort she made to regain her\nself-control, and soon she was once more calm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me get up now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave her his hand and helped her to her feet. Taking her arm, he led\nher to the chair. She sat down wearily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't talk to me for a minute or two,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen at last she spoke it was to say something which he did not expect.\nShe gave a little sigh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I've made rather a mess of things,\" she said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe did not answer, and once more there was a silence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Isn't it possible to get hold of the letter?\" she said at last.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do not think anything would have been said to me about it if the\nperson in whose possession it is was not prepared to sell it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Who's got it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Chinese woman who was living in Hammond's house.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA spot of colour flickered for an instant on Leslie's cheek-bones.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does she want an awful lot for it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I imagine that she has a very shrewd idea of its value. I doubt if it\nwould be possible to get hold of it except for a very large sum.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you going to let me be hanged?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think it's so simple as all that to secure possession of an\nunwelcome piece of evidence? It's no different from suborning a witness.\nYou have no right to make any such suggestion to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then what is going to happen to me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Justice must take its course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe grew very pale. A little shudder passed through her body.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I put myself in your hands. Of course I have no right to ask you to do\nanything that isn't proper.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce had not bargained for the little break in her voice which her\nhabitual self-restraint made quite intolerably moving. She looked at him\nwith humble eyes, and he thought that if he rejected their appeal they\nwould haunt him for the rest of his life. After all, nothing could bring\npoor Hammond back to life again. He wondered what really was the\nexplanation of that letter. It was not fair to conclude from it that she\nhad killed Hammond without provocation. He had lived in the East a long\ntime and his sense of professional honour was not perhaps so acute as it\nhad been twenty years before. He stared at the floor. He made up his\nmind to do something which he knew was unjustifiable, but it stuck in\nhis throat and he felt dully resentful towards Leslie. It embarrassed\nhim a little to speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know exactly what your husband's circumstances are?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFlushing a rosy red, she shot a swift glance at him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He has a good many tin shares and a small share in two or three rubber\nestates. I suppose he could raise money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He would have to be told what it was for.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe was silent for a moment. She seemed to think.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's in love with me still. He would make any sacrifice to save me. Is\nthere any need for him to see the letter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce frowned a little, and, quick to notice, she went on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Robert is an old friend of yours. I'm not asking you to do anything for\nme, I'm asking you to save a rather simple, kind man who never did you\nany harm from all the pain that's possible.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce did not reply. He rose to go and Mrs. Crosbie, with the grace\nthat was natural to her, held out her hand. She was shaken by the scene,\nand her look was haggard, but she made a brave attempt to speed him with\ncourtesy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's so good of you to take all this trouble for me. I can't begin to\ntell you how grateful I am.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce returned to his office. He sat in his own room, quite still,\nattempting to do no work, and pondered. His imagination brought him many\nstrange ideas. He shuddered a little. At last there was the discreet\nknock on the door which he was expecting. Ong Chi Seng came in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was just going out to have my tiffin, sir,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know if there was anything you wanted before I went, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think so. Did you make another appointment for Mr. Reed?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, sir. He will come at three o'clock.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOng Chi Seng turned away, walked to the door, and put his long slim\nfingers on the handle. Then, as though on an afterthought, he turned\nback.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is there anything you wish me to say to my friend, sir?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlthough Ong Chi Seng spoke English so admirably he had still a\ndifficulty with the letter R, and he pronounced it \"fliend.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What friend?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"About the letter Mrs. Crosbie wrote to Hammond deceased, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh! I'd forgotten about that. I mentioned it to Mrs. Crosbie and she\ndenies having written anything of the sort. It's evidently a forgery.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce took the copy from his pocket and handed it to Ong Chi Seng.\nOng Chi Seng ignored the gesture.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In that case, sir, I suppose there would be no objection if my fliend\ndelivered the letter to the Deputy Public Prosecutor.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"None. But I don't quite see what good that would do your friend.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My fliend, sir, thought it was his duty in the interests of justice.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I am the last man in the world to interfere with anyone who wishes to\ndo his duty, Chi Seng.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe eyes of the lawyer and of the Chinese clerk met. Not the shadow of a\nsmile hovered on the lips of either, but they understood each other\nperfectly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I quite understand, sir,\" said Ong Chi Seng, \"but from my study of the\ncase R. <i>v.</i> Crosbie I am of opinion that the production of such a\nletter would be damaging to our client.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have always had a very high opinion of your legal acumen, Chi Seng.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It has occurred to me, sir, that if I could persuade my fliend to\ninduce the Chinese woman who has the letter to deliver it into our hands\nit would save a great deal of trouble.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce idly drew faces on his blotting-paper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose your friend is a business man. In what circumstances do you\nthink he would be induced to part with the letter?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He has not got the letter. The Chinese woman has the letter. He is only\na relation of the Chinese woman. She is an ignorant woman; she did not\nknow the value of that letter till my fliend told her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What value did he put on it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ten thousand dollars, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good God! Where on earth do you suppose Mrs. Crosbie can get ten\nthousand dollars! I tell you the letter's a forgery.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe looked up at Ong Chi Seng as he spoke. The clerk was unmoved by the\noutburst. He stood at the side of the desk, civil, cool and observant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Crosbie owns an eighth share of the Betong Rubber Estate and a\nsixth share of the Selantan River Rubber Estate. I have a fliend who\nwill lend him the money on the security of his property.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You have a large circle of acquaintance, Chi Seng.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, you can tell them all to go to hell. I would never advise Mr.\nCrosbie to give a penny more than five thousand for a letter that can be\nvery easily explained.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Chinese woman does not want to sell the letter, sir. My fliend took\na long time to persuade her. It is useless to offer her less than the\nsum mentioned.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce looked at Ong Chi Seng for at least three minutes. The clerk\nbore the searching scrutiny without embarrassment. He stood in a\nrespectful attitude with downcast eyes. Mr. Joyce knew his man. Clever\nfellow, Chi Seng, he thought, I wonder how much he's going to get out of\nit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ten thousand dollars is a very large sum.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Crosbie will certainly pay it rather than see his wife hanged,\nsir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAgain Mr. Joyce paused. What more did Chi Seng know than he had said? He\nmust be pretty sure of his ground if he was obviously so unwilling to\nbargain. That sum had been fixed because whoever it was that was\nmanaging the affair knew it was the largest amount that Robert Crosbie\ncould raise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where is the Chinese woman now?\" asked Mr. Joyce.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She is staying at the house of my fliend, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will she come here?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think it more better if you go to her, sir. I can take you to the\nhouse to-night and she will give you the letter. She is a very ignorant\nwoman, sir, and she does not understand cheques.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wasn't thinking of giving her a cheque. I will bring bank-notes with\nme.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would only be waste of valuable time to bring less than ten thousand\ndollars, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I quite understand.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will go and tell my fliend after I have had my tiffin, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Very good. You'd better meet me outside the club at ten o'clock\nto-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"With pleasure, sir,\" said Ong Chi Seng.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave Mr. Joyce a little bow and left the room. Mr. Joyce went out to\nhave luncheon, too. He went to the club and here, as he had expected, he\nsaw Robert Crosbie. He was sitting at a crowded table, and as he passed\nhim, looking for a place, Mr. Joyce touched him on the shoulder.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'd like a word or two with you before you go,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Right you are. Let me know when you're ready.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce had made up his mind how to tackle him. He played a rubber of\nbridge after luncheon in order to allow time for the club to empty\nitself. He did not want on this particular matter to see Crosbie in his\noffice. Presently Crosbie came into the card-room and looked on till the\ngame was finished. The other players went on their various affairs, and\nthe two were left alone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A rather unfortunate thing has happened, old man,\" said Mr. Joyce, in a\ntone which he sought to render as casual as possible. \"It appears that\nyour wife sent a letter to Hammond asking him to come to the bungalow on\nthe night he was killed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But that's impossible,\" cried Crosbie. \"She's always stated that she\nhad had no communication with Hammond. I know from my own knowledge that\nshe hadn't set eyes on him for a couple of months.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The fact remains that the letter exists. It's in the possession of the\nChinese woman Hammond was living with. Your wife meant to give you a\npresent on your birthday, and she wanted Hammond to help her to get it.\nIn the emotional excitement that she suffered from after the tragedy,\nshe forgot all about it, and having once denied having any communication\nwith Hammond she was afraid to say that she had made a mistake. It was,\nof course, very unfortunate, but I dare say it was not unnatural.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCrosbie did not speak. His large, red face bore an expression of\ncomplete bewilderment, and Mr. Joyce was at once relieved and\nexasperated by his lack of comprehension. He was a stupid man, and Mr.\nJoyce had no patience with stupidity. But his distress since the\ncatastrophe had touched a soft spot in the lawyer's heart; and Mrs.\nCrosbie had struck the right note when she asked him to help her, not\nfor her sake, but for her husband's.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I need not tell you that it would be very awkward if this letter found\nits way into the hands of the prosecution. Your wife has lied, and she\nwould be asked to explain the lie. It alters things a little if Hammond\ndid not intrude, an unwanted guest, but came to your house by\ninvitation. It would be easy to arouse in the assessors a certain\nindecision of mind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce hesitated. He was face to face now with his decision. If it\nhad been a time for humour, he could have smiled at the reflection that\nhe was taking so grave a step, and that the man for whom he was taking\nit had not the smallest conception of its gravity. If he gave the matter\na thought, he probably imagined that what Mr. Joyce was doing was what\nany lawyer did in the ordinary run of business.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My dear Robert, you are not only my client, but my friend. I think we\nmust get hold of that letter. It'll cost a good deal of money. Except\nfor that I should have preferred to say nothing to you about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How much?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Ten thousand dollars.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's a devil of a lot. With the slump and one thing and another it'll\ntake just about all I've got.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Can you get it at once?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I suppose so. Old Charlie Meadows will let me have it on my tin shares\nand on those two estates I'm interested in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Then will you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is it absolutely necessary?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you want your wife to be acquitted.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCrosbie grew very red. His mouth sagged strangely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But...\" he could not find words, his face now was purple. \"But I\ndon't understand. She can explain. You don't mean to say they'd find her\nguilty? They couldn't hang her for putting a noxious vermin out of the\nway.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course they wouldn't hang her. They might only find her guilty of\nmanslaughter. She'd probably get off with two or three years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCrosbie started to his feet and his red face was distraught with horror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Three years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen something seemed to dawn in that slow intelligence of his. His mind\nwas darkness across which shot suddenly a flash of lightning, and though\nthe succeeding darkness was as profound, there remained the memory of\nsomething not seen but perhaps just descried. Mr. Joyce saw that\nCrosbie's big red hands, coarse and hard with all the odd jobs he had\nset them to, trembled.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What was the present she wanted to make me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"She says she wanted to give you a new gun.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOnce more that great red face flushed a deeper red.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When have you got to have the money ready?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was something odd in his voice now. It sounded as though he spoke\nwith invisible hands clutching at his throat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At ten o'clock to-night. I thought you could bring it to my office at\nabout six.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is the woman coming to you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I'm going to her.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll bring the money. I'll come with you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce looked at him sharply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think there's any need for you to do that? I think it would be\nbetter if you left me to deal with this matter by myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's my money, isn't it? I'm going to come.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce shrugged his shoulders. They rose and shook hands, Mr. Joyce\nlooked at him curiously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt ten o'clock they met in the empty club.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Everything all right?\" asked Mr. Joyce.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes. I've got the money in my pocket.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let's go then.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey walked down the steps. Mr. Joyce's car was waiting for them in the\nsquare, silent at that hour, and as they came to it Ong Chi Seng stepped\nout of the shadow of a house. He took his seat beside the driver and\ngave him a direction. They drove past the Hotel de l'Europe and turned\nup by the Sailor's Home to get into Victoria Street. Here the Chinese\nshops were still open, idlers lounged about, and in the roadway\nrickshaws and motor-cars and gharries gave a busy air to the scene.\nSuddenly their car stopped and Chi Seng turned round.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think it more better if we walk here, sir,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey got out and he went on. They followed a step or two behind. Then he\nasked them to stop.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You wait here, sir. I go in and speak to my fliend.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went into a shop, open to the street, where three or four Chinese\nwere standing behind the counter. It was one of those strange shops\nwhere nothing was on view, and you wondered what it was they sold there.\nThey saw him address a stout man in a duck suit with a large gold chain\nacross his breast, and the man shot a quick glance out into the night.\nHe gave Chi Seng a key and Chi Seng came out. He beckoned to the two men\nwaiting and slid into a doorway at the side of the shop. They followed\nhim and found themselves at the foot of a flight of stairs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you wait a minute I will light a match,\" he said, always\nresourceful. \"You come upstairs, please.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe held a Japanese match in front of them, but it scarcely dispelled the\ndarkness and they groped their way up behind him. On the first floor he\nunlocked a door and going in lit a gas-jet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come in, please,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a small square room, with one window, and the only furniture\nconsisted of two low Chinese beds covered with matting. In one corner\nwas a large chest, with an elaborate lock, and on this stood a shabby\ntray with an opium pipe on it and a lamp. There was in the room the\nfaint, acrid scent of the drug. They sat down and Ong Chi Seng offered\nthem cigarettes. In a moment the door was opened by the fat Chinaman\nwhom they had seen behind the counter. He bade them good-evening in very\ngood English, and sat down by the side of his fellow-countryman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Chinese woman is just coming,\" said Chi Seng.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA boy from the shop brought in a tray with a teapot and cups and the\nChinaman offered them a cup of tea. Crosbie refused. The Chinese talked\nto one another in undertones, but Crosbie and Mr. Joyce were silent. At\nlast there was the sound of a voice outside; someone was calling in a\nlow tone; and the Chinaman went to the door. He opened it, spoke a few\nwords, and ushered a woman in. Mr. Joyce looked at her. He had heard\nmuch about her since Hammond's death, but he had never seen her. She was\na stoutish person, not very young, with a broad, phlegmatic face, she\nwas powdered and rouged and her eyebrows were a thin black line, but she\ngave you the impression of a woman of character. She wore a pale blue\njacket and a white skirt, her costume was not quite European nor quite\nChinese, but on her feet were little Chinese silk slippers. She wore\nheavy gold chains round her neck, gold bangles on her wrists, gold\near-rings and elaborate gold pins in her black hair. She walked in\nslowly, with the air of a woman sure of herself, but with a certain\nheaviness of tread, and sat down on the bed beside Ong Chi Seng. He said\nsomething to her and nodding she gave an incurious glance at the two\nwhite men.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Has she got the letter?\" asked Mr. Joyce.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCrosbie said nothing, but produced a roll of five-hundred-dollar notes.\nHe counted out twenty and handed them to Chi Seng.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will you see if that is correct?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe clerk counted them and gave them to the fat Chinaman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Quite correct, sir.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Chinaman counted them once more and put them in his pocket. He spoke\nagain to the woman and she drew from her bosom a letter. She gave it to\nChi Seng who cast his eyes over it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is the right document, sir,\" he said, and was about to give it to\nMr. Joyce when Crosbie took it from him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let me look at it,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce watched him read and then held out his hand for it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You'd better let me have it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCrosbie folded it up deliberately and put it in his pocket.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I'm going to keep it myself. It's cost me enough money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce made no rejoinder. The three Chinese watched the little\npassage, but what they thought about it, or whether they thought, it was\nimpossible to tell from their impassive countenances. Mr. Joyce rose to\nhis feet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you want me any more to-night, sir?\" said Ong Chi Seng.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\" He knew that the clerk wished to stay behind in order to get his\nagreed share of the money, and he turned to Crosbie. \"Are you ready?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCrosbie did not answer, but stood up. The Chinaman went to the door and\nopened it for them. Chi Seng found a bit of candle and lit it in order\nto light them down, and the two Chinese accompanied them to the street.\nThey left the woman sitting quietly on the bed smoking a cigarette. When\nthey reached the street the Chinese left them and went once more\nupstairs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What are you going to do with that letter?\" asked Mr. Joyce.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Keep it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey walked to where the car was waiting for them and here Mr. Joyce\noffered his friend a lift. Crosbie shook his head.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm going to walk.\" He hesitated a little and shuffled his feet. \"I\nwent to Singapore on the night of Hammond's death partly to buy a new\ngun that a man I knew wanted to dispose of. Good-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe disappeared quickly into the darkness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce was quite right about the trial. The assessors went into court\nfully determined to acquit Mrs. Crosbie. She gave evidence on her own\nbehalf. She told her story simply and with straightforwardness. The\nD.P.P. was a kindly man and it was plain that he took no great pleasure\nin his task. He asked the necessary questions in a deprecating manner.\nHis speech for the prosecution might really have been a speech for the\ndefence, and the assessors took less than five minutes to consider their\npopular verdict. It was impossible to prevent the great outburst of\napplause with which it was received by the crowd that packed the\ncourt-house. The judge congratulated Mrs. Crosbie and she was a free\nwoman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNo one had expressed a more violent disapprobation of Hammond's\nbehaviour than Mrs. Joyce; she was a woman loyal to her friends and she\nhad insisted on the Crosbies staying with her after the trial, for she\nin common with everyone else had no doubt of the result, till they could\nmake arrangements to go away. It was out of the question for poor, dear,\nbrave Leslie to return to the bungalow at which the horrible catastrophe\nhad taken place. The trial was over by half-past twelve and when they\nreached the Joyces' house a grand luncheon was awaiting them. Cocktails\nwere ready, Mrs. Joyce's million-dollar cocktail was celebrated through\nall the Malay States, and Mrs. Joyce drank Leslie's health. She was a\ntalkative, vivacious woman, and now she was in the highest spirits. It\nwas fortunate, for the rest of them were silent. She did not wonder; her\nhusband never had much to say, and the other two were naturally\nexhausted from the long strain to which they had been subjected. During\nluncheon she carried on a bright and spirited monologue. Then coffee was\nserved.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now, children,\" she said in her gay, bustling fashion, \"you must have a\nrest and after tea I shall take you both for a drive to the sea.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce, who lunched at home only by exception, had of course to go\nback to his office.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm afraid I can't do that, Mrs. Joyce,\" said Crosbie. \"I've got to get\nback to the estate at once.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not to-day?\" she cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, now. I've neglected it for too long and I have urgent business.\nBut I shall be very grateful if you will keep Leslie until we have\ndecided what to do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Joyce was about to expostulate, but her husband prevented her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If he must go, he must, and there's an end of it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was something in the lawyer's tone which made her look at him\nquickly. She held her tongue and there was a moment's silence. Then\nCrosbie spoke again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you'll forgive me, I'll start at once so that I can get there before\ndark.\" He rose from the table. \"Will you come and see me off, Leslie?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Of course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey went out of the dining-room together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think that's rather inconsiderate of him,\" said Mrs. Joyce. \"He must\nknow that Leslie wants to be with him just now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sure he wouldn't go if it wasn't absolutely necessary.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I'll just see that Leslie's room is ready for her. She wants a\ncomplete rest, of course, and then amusement.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Joyce left the room and Joyce sat down again. In a short time he\nheard Crosbie start the engine of his motor-cycle and then noisily\nscrunch over the gravel of the garden path. He got up and went into the\ndrawing-room. Mrs. Crosbie was standing in the middle of it, looking\ninto space, and in her hand was an open letter. He recognised it. She\ngave him a glance as he came in and he saw that she was deathly pale.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He knows,\" she whispered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce went up to her and took the letter from her hand. He lit a\nmatch and set the paper afire. She watched it burn. When he could hold\nit no longer he dropped it on the tiled floor and they both looked at\nthe paper curl and blacken. Then he trod it into ashes with his foot.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What does he know?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe gave him a long, long stare and into her eyes came a strange look.\nWas it contempt or despair? Mr. Joyce could not tell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He knows that Geoff. was my lover.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Joyce made no movement and uttered no sound.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He'd been my lover for years. He became my lover almost immediately\nafter he came back from the war. We knew how careful we must be. When we\nbecame lovers I pretended I was tired of him, and he seldom came to the\nhouse when Robert was there. I used to drive out to a place we knew and\nhe met me, two or three times a week, and when Robert went to Singapore\nhe used to come to the bungalow late, when the boys had gone for the\nnight. We saw one another constantly, all the time, and not a soul had\nthe smallest suspicion of it. And then lately, a year ago, he began to\nchange. I didn't know what was the matter. I couldn't believe that he\ndidn't care for me any more. He always denied it. I was frantic. I made\nhim scenes. Sometimes I thought he hated me. Oh, if you knew what\nagonies I endured. I passed through hell. I knew he didn't want me any\nmore and I wouldn't let him go. Misery! Misery! I loved him. I'd given\nhim everything. He was my life. And then I heard he was living with a\nChinese woman. I couldn't believe it. I wouldn't believe it. At last I\nsaw her, I saw her with my own eyes, walking in the village, with her\ngold bracelets and her necklaces, an old, fat, Chinese woman. She was\nolder than I was. Horrible! They all knew in the kampong that she was\nhis mistress. And when I passed her, she looked at me and I knew that\nshe knew I was his mistress too. I sent for him. I told him I must see\nhim. You've read the letter. I was mad to write it. I didn't know what I\nwas doing. I didn't care. I hadn't seen him for ten days. It was a\nlifetime. And when last we'd parted he took me in his arms and kissed\nme, and told me not to worry. And he went straight from my arms to\nhers.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe had been speaking in a low voice, vehemently, and now she stopped\nand wrung her hands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That damned letter. We'd always been so careful. He always tore up any\nword I wrote to him the moment he'd read it. How was I to know he'd\nleave that one? He came, and I told him I knew about the Chinawoman. He\ndenied it. He said it was only scandal. I was beside myself. I don't\nknow what I said to him. Oh, I hated him then. I tore him limb from\nlimb. I said everything I could to wound him. I insulted him. I could\nhave spat in his face. And at last he turned on me. He told me he was\nsick and tired of me and never wanted to see me again. He said I bored\nhim to death. And then he acknowledged that it was true about the\nChinawoman. He said he'd known her for years, before the war, and she\nwas the only woman who really meant anything to him, and the rest was\njust pastime. And he said he was glad I knew and now at last I'd leave\nhim alone. And then I don't know what happened, I was beside myself, I\nsaw red. I seized the revolver and I fired. He gave a cry and I saw I'd\nhit him. He staggered and rushed for the verandah. I ran after him and\nfired again. He fell and then I stood over him and I fired and fired\ntill the revolver went click, click, and I knew there were no more\ncartridges.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last she stopped, panting. Her face was no longer human, it was\ndistorted with cruelty, and rage and pain. You would never have thought\nthat this quiet, refined woman was capable of such fiendish passion. Mr.\nJoyce took a step backwards. He was absolutely aghast at the sight of\nher. It was not a face, it was a gibbering, hideous mask. Then they\nheard a voice calling from another room, a loud, friendly, cheerful\nvoice. It was Mrs. Joyce.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Come along, Leslie darling, your room's ready. You must be dropping\nwith sleep.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMrs. Crosbie's features gradually composed themselves. Those passions,\nso clearly delineated, were smoothed away as with your hand you would\nsmooth a crumpled paper, and in a minute the face was cool and calm and\nunlined. She was a trifle pale, but her lips broke into a pleasant,\naffable smile. She was once more the well-bred and even distinguished\nwoman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm coming, Dorothy dear. I'm sorry to give you so much trouble.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThe new assistant arrived in the afternoon. When the Resident, Mr.\nWarburton, was told that the prahu was in sight he put on his solar\ntopee and went down to the landing-stage. The guard, eight little Dyak\nsoldiers, stood to attention as he passed. He noted with satisfaction\nthat their bearing was martial, their uniforms neat and clean, and their\nguns shining. They were a credit to him. From the landing-stage he\nwatched the bend of the river round which in a moment the boat would\nsweep. He looked very smart in his spotless ducks and white shoes. He\nheld under his arm a gold-headed Malacca cane which had been given him\nby the Sultan of Perak. He awaited the newcomer with mingled feelings.\nThere was more work in the district than one man could properly do, and\nduring his periodical tours of the country under his charge it had been\ninconvenient to leave the station in the hands of a native clerk, but he\nhad been so long the only white man there that he could not face the\narrival of another without misgiving. He was accustomed to loneliness.\nDuring the war he had not seen an English face for three years; and once\nwhen he was instructed to put up an afforestation officer he was seized\nwith panic, so that when the stranger was due to arrive, having arranged\neverything for his reception, he wrote a note telling him he was obliged\nto go up-river, and fled; he remained away till he was informed by a\nmessenger that his guest had left.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow the prahu appeared in the broad reach. It was manned by prisoners,\nDyaks under various sentences, and a couple of warders were waiting on\nthe landing-stage to take them back to gaol. They were sturdy fellows,\nused to the river, and they rowed with a powerful stroke. As the boat\nreached the side a man got out from under the attap awning and stepped\non shore. The guard presented arms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Here we are at last. By God, I'm as cramped as the devil. I've brought\nyou your mail.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe spoke with exuberant joviality. Mr. Warburton politely held out his\nhand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Cooper, I presume?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's right. Were you expecting anyone else?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe question had a facetious intent, but the Resident did not smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My name is Warburton. I'll show you your quarters. They'll bring your\nkit along.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe preceded Cooper along the narrow pathway and they entered a compound\nin which stood a small bungalow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've had it made as habitable as I could, but of course no one has\nlived in it for a good many years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was built on piles. It consisted of a long living-room which opened\non to a broad verandah, and behind, on each side of a passage, were two\nbedrooms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This'll do me all right,\" said Cooper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I dare say you want to have a bath and a change. I shall be very much\npleased if you'll dine with me to-night. Will eight o'clock suit you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Any old time will do for me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Resident gave a polite, but slightly disconcerted smile, and\nwithdrew. He returned to the Fort where his own residence was. The\nimpression which Allen Cooper had given him was not very favourable, but\nhe was a fair man, and he knew that it was unjust to form an opinion on\nso brief a glimpse. Cooper seemed to be about thirty. He was a tall,\nthin fellow, with a sallow face in which there was not a spot of colour.\nIt was a face all in one tone. He had a large, hooked nose and blue\neyes. When, entering the bungalow, he had taken off his topee and flung\nit to a waiting boy, Mr. Warburton noticed that his large skull, covered\nwith short, brown hair, contrasted somewhat oddly with a weak, small\nchin. He was dressed in khaki shorts and a khaki shirt, but they were\nshabby and soiled; and his battered topee had not been cleaned for days.\nMr. Warburton reflected that the young man had spent a week on a\ncoasting steamer and had passed the last forty-eight hours lying in the\nbottom of a prahu.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We'll see what he looks like when he comes in to dinner.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe went into his room, where his things were as neatly laid out as if he\nhad an English valet, undressed, and, walking down the stairs to the\nbath-house, sluiced himself with cool water. The only concession he made\nto the climate was to wear a white dinner jacket; but otherwise, in a\nboiled shirt and a high collar, silk socks and patent-leather shoes, he\ndressed as formally as though he were dining at his club in Pall Mall. A\ncareful host, he went into the dining-room to see that the table was\nproperly laid. It was gay with orchids, and the silver shone brightly.\nThe napkins were folded into elaborate shapes. Shaded candles in silver\ncandlesticks shed a soft light. Mr. Warburton smiled his approval and\nreturned to the sitting-room to await his guest. Presently he appeared.\nCooper was wearing the khaki shorts, the khaki shirt, and the ragged\njacket in which he had landed. Mr. Warburton's smile of greeting froze\non his face.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Hulloa, you're all dressed up,\" said Cooper. \"I didn't know you were\ngoing to do that. I very nearly put on a sarong.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It doesn't matter at all. I dare say your boys were busy.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You needn't have bothered to dress on my account, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't. I always dress for dinner.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Even when you're alone?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Especially when I'm alone,\" replied Mr. Warburton, with a frigid stare.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe saw a twinkle of amusement in Cooper's eyes, and he flushed an angry\nred. Mr. Warburton was a hot-tempered man; you might have guessed that\nfrom his red face with its pugnacious features and from his red hair now\ngrowing white; his blue eyes, cold as a rule and observing, could flash\nwith sudden wrath; but he was a man of the world and he hoped a just\none. He must do his best to get on with this fellow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When I lived in London I moved in circles in which it would have been\njust as eccentric not to dress for dinner every night as not to have a\nbath every morning. When I came to Borneo I saw no reason to discontinue\nso good a habit. For three years during the war I never saw a white man.\nI never omitted to dress on a single occasion on which I was well enough\nto come into dinner. You have not been very long in this country;\nbelieve me, there is no better way to maintain the proper pride which\nyou should have in yourself. When a white man surrenders in the\nslightest degree to the influences that surround him he very soon loses\nhis self-respect, and when he loses his self-respect you may be quite\nsure the natives will soon cease to respect him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, if you expect me to put on a boiled shirt and a stiff collar in\nthis heat I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When you are dining in your own bungalow you will, of course, dress as\nyou think fit, but when you do me the pleasure of dining with me,\nperhaps you will come to the conclusion that it is only polite to wear\nthe costume usual in civilised society.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTwo Malay boys, in sarongs and songkoks, with smart white coats and\nbrass buttons, came in, one bearing gin pahits, and the other a tray on\nwhich were olives and anchovies. Then they went in to dinner. Mr.\nWarburton flattered himself that he had the best cook, a Chinese, in\nBorneo, and he took great trouble to have as good food as in the\ndifficult circumstances was possible. He exercised much ingenuity in\nmaking the best of his materials.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Would you care to look at the menu?\" he said, handing it to Cooper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was written in French and the dishes had resounding names. They were\nwaited on by the two boys. In opposite corners of the room two more\nwaved immense fans, and so gave movement to the sultry air. The fare was\nsumptuous and the champagne excellent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you do yourself like this every day?\" said Cooper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton gave the menu a careless glance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I have not noticed that the dinner is any different from usual,\" he\nsaid. \"I eat very little myself, but I make a point of having a proper\ndinner served to me every night. It keeps the cook in practice and it's\ngood discipline for the boys.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe conversation proceeded with effort. Mr. Warburton was elaborately\ncourteous and, it may be, found a slightly malicious amusement in the\nembarrassment which he thereby occasioned in his companion. Cooper had\nnot been more than a few months in Sembulu, and Mr. Warburton's\nenquiries about friends of his in Kuala Solor were soon exhausted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way,\" he said presently, \"did you meet a lad called Hennerley?\nHe's come out recently, I believe.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh yes, he's in the police. A rotten bounder.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should hardly have expected him to be that. His uncle is my friend\nLord Barraclough. I had a letter from Lady Barraclough only the other\nday asking me to look out for him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I heard he was related to somebody or other. I suppose that's how he\ngot the job. He's been to Eton and Oxford and he doesn't forget to let\nyou know it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You surprise me,\" said Mr. Warburton. \"All his family have been at Eton\nand Oxford for a couple of hundred years. I should have expected him to\ntake it as a matter of course.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought him a damned prig.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"To what school did you go?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was born in Barbados. I was educated there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I see.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton managed to put so much offensiveness into his brief reply\nthat Cooper flushed. For a moment he was silent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've had two or three letters from Kuala Solor,\" continued Mr.\nWarburton, \"and my impression was that young Hennerley was a great\nsuccess. They say he's a first-rate sportsman.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, yes, he's very popular. He's just the sort of fellow they would\nlike in K.S. I haven't got much use for the first-rate sportsman myself.\nWhat does it amount to in the long run that a man can play golf and\ntennis better than other people? And who cares if he can make a break of\nseventy-five at billiards? They attach a damned sight too much\nimportance to that sort of thing in England.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think so? I was under the impression that the first-rate\nsportsman had come out of the war certainly no worse than anyone else.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, if you're going to talk of the war then I do know what I'm talking\nabout. I was in the same regiment as Hennerley and I can tell you that\nthe men couldn't stick him at any price.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How do you know?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Because I was one of the men.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, you hadn't got a commission.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A fat chance I had of getting a commission. I was what was called a\nColonial. I hadn't been to a public-school and I had no influence. I was\nin the ranks the whole damned time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCooper frowned. He seemed to have difficulty in preventing himself from\nbreaking out into violent invective. Mr. Warburton watched him, his\nlittle blue eyes narrowed, watched him and formed his opinion. Changing\nthe conversation, he began to speak to Cooper about the work that would\nbe required of him, and as the clock struck ten he rose.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, I won't keep you any more. I dare say you're tired by your\njourney.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey shook hands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I say, look here,\" said Cooper, \"I wonder if you can find me a boy.\nThe boy I had before never turned up when I was starting from K.S. He\ntook my kit on board and all that, and then disappeared. I didn't know\nhe wasn't there till we were out of the river.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll ask my head-boy. I have no doubt he can find you someone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right. Just tell him to send the boy along and if I like the look\nof him I'll take him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere was a moon, so that no lantern was needed. Cooper walked across\nfrom the Fort to his bungalow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder why on earth they've sent me a fellow like that?\" reflected\nMr. Warburton. \"If that's the kind of man they're going to get out now I\ndon't think much of it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe strolled down his garden. The Fort was built on the top of a little\nhill and the garden ran down to the river's edge; on the bank was an\narbour, and hither it was his habit to come after dinner to smoke a\ncheroot. And often from the river that flowed below him a voice was\nheard, the voice of some Malay too timorous to venture into the light of\nday, and a complaint or an accusation was softly wafted to his ears, a\npiece of information was whispered to him or a useful hint, which\notherwise would never have come into his official ken. He threw himself\nheavily into a long rattan chair. Cooper! An envious, ill-bred fellow,\nbumptious, self-assertive and vain. But Mr. Warburton's irritation could\nnot withstand the silent beauty of the night. The air was scented with\nthe sweet-smelling flowers of a tree that grew at the entrance to the\narbour, and the fire-flies, sparkling dimly, flew with their slow and\nsilvery flight. The moon made a pathway on the broad river for the light\nfeet of Sila's bride, and on the further bank a row of palm trees was\ndelicately silhouetted against the sky. Peace stole into the soul of Mr.\nWarburton.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was a queer creature and he had had a singular career. At the age of\ntwenty-one he had inherited a considerable fortune, a hundred thousand\npounds, and when he left Oxford he threw himself into the gay life,\nwhich in those days (now Mr. Warburton was a man of four and fifty)\noffered itself to the young man of good family. He had his flat in Mount\nStreet, his private hansom, and his hunting-box in Warwickshire. He went\nto all the places where the fashionable congregate. He was handsome,\namusing, and generous. He was a figure in the society of London in the\nearly nineties, and society then had not lost its exclusiveness nor its\nbrilliance. The Boer War which shook it was unthought of; the Great War\nwhich destroyed it was prophesied only by the pessimists. It was no\nunpleasant thing to be a rich young man in those days, and Mr.\nWarburton's chimney-piece during the season was packed with cards for\none great function after another. Mr. Warburton displayed them with\ncomplacency. For Mr. Warburton was a snob. He was not a timid snob, a\nlittle ashamed of being impressed by his betters, nor a snob who sought\nthe intimacy of persons who had acquired celebrity in politics or\nnotoriety in the arts, nor the snob who was dazzled by riches; he was\nthe naked, unadulterated common snob who dearly loved a lord. He was\ntouchy and quick-tempered, but he would much rather have been snubbed by\na person of quality than flattered by a commoner. His name figured\ninsignificantly in Burke's Peerage, and it was marvellous to watch the\ningenuity he used to mention his distant relationship to the noble\nfamily he belonged to; but never a word did he say of the honest\nLiverpool manufacturer from whom, through his mother, a Miss Gubbins, he\nhad come by his fortune. It was the terror of his fashionable life that\nat Cowes, maybe, or at Ascot, when he was with a duchess or even with a\nprince of the blood, one of these relatives would claim acquaintance\nwith him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis failing was too obvious not soon to become notorious, but its\nextravagance saved it from being merely despicable. The great whom he\nadored laughed at him, but in their hearts felt his adoration not\nunnatural. Poor Warburton was a dreadful snob, of course, but after all\nhe was a good fellow. He was always ready to back a bill for an\nimpecunious nobleman, and if you were in a tight corner you could safely\ncount on him for a hundred pounds. He gave good dinners. He played whist\nbadly, but never minded how much he lost if the company was select. He\nhappened to be a gambler, an unlucky one, but he was a good loser, and\nit was impossible not to admire the coolness with which he lost five\nhundred pounds at a sitting. His passion for cards, almost as strong as\nhis passion for titles, was the cause of his undoing. The life he led\nwas expensive and his gambling losses were formidable. He began to\nplunge more heavily, first on horses, and then on the Stock Exchange. He\nhad a certain simplicity of character, and the unscrupulous found him an\ningenuous prey. I do not know if he ever realised that his smart friends\nlaughed at him behind his back, but I think he had an obscure instinct\nthat he could not afford to appear other than careless of his money. He\ngot into the hands of money-lenders. At the age of thirty-four he was\nruined.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was too much imbued with the spirit of his class to hesitate in the\nchoice of his next step. When a man in his set had run through his\nmoney, he went out to the colonies. No one heard Mr. Warburton repine.\nHe made no complaint because a noble friend had advised a disastrous\nspeculation, he pressed nobody to whom he had lent money to repay it, he\npaid his debts (if he had only known it, the despised blood of the\nLiverpool manufacturer came out in him there), sought help from no one,\nand, never having done a stroke of work in his life, looked for a means\nof livelihood. He remained cheerful, unconcerned and full of humour. He\nhad no wish to make anyone with whom he happened to be uncomfortable by\nthe recital of his misfortune. Mr. Warburton was a snob, but he was also\na gentleman.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe only favour he asked of any of the great friends in whose daily\ncompany he had lived for years was a recommendation. The able man who\nwas at that time Sultan of Sembulu took him into his service. The night\nbefore he sailed he dined for the last time at his club.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I hear you're going away, Warburton,\" the old Duke of Hereford said to\nhim.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I'm going to Borneo.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good God, what are you going there for?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I'm broke.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you? I'm sorry. Well, let us know when you come back. I hope you\nhave a good time.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh yes. Lots of shooting, you know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Duke nodded and passed on. A few hours later Mr. Warburton watched\nthe coast of England recede into the mist, and he left behind everything\nwhich to him made life worth living.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTwenty years had passed since then. He kept up a busy correspondence\nwith various great ladies and his letters were amusing and chatty. He\nnever lost his love for titled persons and paid careful attention to the\nannouncements in <i>The Times</i> (which reached him six weeks after\npublication) of their comings and goings. He perused the column which\nrecords births, deaths, and marriages, and he was always ready with his\nletter of congratulation or condolence. The illustrated papers told him\nhow people looked and on his periodical visits to England, able to take\nup the threads as though they had never been broken, he knew all about\nany new person who might have appeared on the social surface. His\ninterest in the world of fashion was as vivid as when himself had been a\nfigure in it. It still seemed to him the only thing that mattered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut insensibly another interest had entered into his life. The position\nhe found himself in flattered his vanity; he was no longer the sycophant\ncraving the smiles of the great, he was the master whose word was law.\nHe was gratified by the guard of Dyak soldiers who presented arms as he\npassed. He liked to sit in judgement on his fellow men. It pleased him\nto compose quarrels between rival chiefs. When the head-hunters were\ntroublesome in the old days he set out to chastise them with a thrill of\npride in his own behaviour. He was too vain not to be of dauntless\ncourage, and a pretty story was told of his coolness in adventuring\nsingle-handed into a stockaded village and demanding the surrender of a\nbloodthirsty pirate. He became a skilful administrator. He was strict,\njust and honest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd little by little he conceived a deep love for the Malays. He\ninterested himself in their habits and customs. He was never tired of\nlistening to their talk. He admired their virtues, and with a smile and\na shrug of the shoulders condoned their vices.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In my day,\" he would say, \"I have been on intimate terms with some of\nthe greatest gentlemen in England, but I have never known finer\ngentlemen than some well-born Malays whom I am proud to call my\nfriends.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe liked their courtesy and their distinguished manners, their\ngentleness and their sudden passions. He knew by instinct exactly how to\ntreat them. He had a genuine tenderness for them. But he never forgot\nthat he was an English gentleman, and he had no patience with the white\nmen who yielded to native customs. He made no surrenders. And he did not\nimitate so many of the white men in taking a native woman to wife, for\nan intrigue of this nature, however sanctified by custom, seemed to him\nnot only shocking but undignified. A man who had been called George by\nAlbert Edward, Prince of Wales, could hardly be expected to have any\nconnection with a native. And when he returned to Borneo from his visits\nto England it was now with something like relief. His friends, like\nhimself, were no longer young, and there was a new generation which\nlooked upon him as a tiresome old man. It seemed to him that the England\nof to-day had lost a good deal of what he had loved in the England of\nhis youth. But Borneo remained the same. It was home to him now. He\nmeant to remain in service as long as was possible, and the hope in his\nheart was that he would die before at last he was forced to retire. He\nhad stated in his will that wherever he died he wished his body to be\nbrought back to Sembulu, and buried among the people he loved within the\nsound of the softly flowing river.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut these emotions he kept hidden from the eyes of men; and no one,\nseeing this spruce, stout, well-set up man, with his clean-shaven strong\nface and his whitening hair, would have dreamed that he cherished so\nprofound a sentiment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe knew how the work of the station should be done, and during the next\nfew days he kept a suspicious eye on his assistant. He saw very soon\nthat he was painstaking and competent. The only fault he had to find\nwith him was that he was brusque with the natives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Malays are shy and very sensitive,\" he said to him. \"I think you\nwill find that you will get much better results if you take care always\nto be polite, patient and kindly.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCooper gave a short, grating laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was born in Barbados and I was in Africa in the war. I don't think\nthere's much about niggers that I don't know.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I know nothing,\" said Mr. Warburton acidly. \"But we were not talking of\nthem. We were talking of Malays.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Aren't they niggers?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are very ignorant,\" replied Mr. Warburton.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe said no more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn the first Sunday after Cooper's arrival he asked him to dinner. He\ndid everything ceremoniously, and though they had met on the previous\nday in the office and later, on the Fort verandah where they drank a gin\nand bitters together at six o'clock, he sent a polite note across to the\nbungalow by a boy. Cooper, however unwillingly, came in evening dress\nand Mr. Warburton, though gratified that his wish was respected, noticed\nwith disdain that the young man's clothes were badly cut and his shirt\nill-fitting. But Mr. Warburton was in a good temper that evening.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By the way,\" he said to him, as he shook hands, \"I've talked to my\nhead-boy about finding you someone and he recommends his nephew. I've\nseen him and he seems a bright and willing lad. Would you like to see\nhim?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't mind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He's waiting now.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton called his boy and told him to send for his nephew. In a\nmoment a tall, slender youth of twenty appeared. He had large dark eyes\nand a good profile. He was very neat in his sarong, a little white coat,\nand a fez, without a tassel, of plum-covered velvet. He answered to the\nname of Abas. Mr. Warburton looked on him with approval, and his manner\ninsensibly softened as he spoke to him in fluent and idiomatic Malay. He\nwas inclined to be sarcastic with white people, but with the Malays he\nhad a happy mixture of condescension and kindliness. He stood in the\nplace of the Sultan. He knew perfectly how to preserve his own dignity\nand at the same time put a native at his ease.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Will he do?\" said Mr. Warburton, turning to Cooper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Yes, I dare say he's no more of a scoundrel than any of the rest of\nthem.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton informed the boy that he was engaged, and dismissed him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You're very lucky to get a boy like that,\" he told Cooper. \"He belongs\nto a very good family. They came over from Malacca nearly a hundred\nyears ago.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't much mind if the boy who cleans my shoes and brings me a drink\nwhen I want it has blue blood in his veins or not. All I ask is that he\nshould do what I tell him and look sharp about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton pursed his lips, but made no reply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey went in to dinner. It was excellent, and the wine was good. Its\ninfluence presently had its effect on them, and they talked not only\nwithout acrimony, but even with friendliness. Mr. Warburton liked to do\nhimself well, and on Sunday night he made it a habit to do himself even\na little better than usual. He began to think he was unfair to Cooper.\nOf course he was not a gentleman, but that was not his fault, and when\nyou got to know him it might be that he would turn out a very good\nfellow. His faults, perhaps, were faults of manner. And he was certainly\ngood at his work, quick, conscientious and thorough. When they reached\nthe dessert Mr. Warburton was feeling kindly disposed towards all\nmankind.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This is your first Sunday, and I'm going to give you a very special\nglass of port. I've only got about two dozen of it left and I keep it\nfor special occasions.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave his boy instructions and presently the bottle was brought. Mr.\nWarburton watched the boy open it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I got this port from my old friend Charles Hollington. He'd had it for\nforty years, and I've had it for a good many. He was well-known to have\nthe best cellar in England.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is he a wine merchant?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not exactly,\" smiled Mr. Warburton. \"I was speaking of Lord Hollington\nof Castle Reagh. He's one of the richest peers in England. A very old\nfriend of mine. I was at Eton with his brother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis was an opportunity that Mr. Warburton could never resist, and he\ntold a little anecdote of which the only point seemed to be that he knew\nan Earl. The port was certainly very good; he drank a glass and then a\nsecond. He lost all caution. He had not talked to a white man for\nmonths. He began to tell stories. He showed himself in the company of\nthe great. Hearing him, you would have thought that at one time\nministries were formed and policies decided on his suggestion whispered\ninto the ear of a duchess or thrown over the dinner-table to be\ngratefully acted on by the confidential adviser of the Sovereign. The\nold days at Ascot, Goodwood and Cowes lived again for him. Another glass\nof port. There were the great house-parties in Yorkshire and in Scotland\nto which he went every year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I had a man called Foreman then, the best valet I ever had, and why do\nyou think he gave me notice? You know in the House-keeper's Room the\nladies' maids and the gentlemen's gentlemen sit according to the\nprecedence of their masters. He told me he was sick of going to party\nafter party at which I was the only commoner. It meant that he always\nhad to sit at the bottom of the table, and all the best bits were taken\nbefore a dish reached him. I told the story to the old Duke of Hereford,\nand he roared. 'By God, sir,' he said, 'if I were King of England, I'd\nmake you a viscount just to give your man a chance.' 'Take him yourself,\nDuke,' I said. 'He's the best valet I've ever had.' 'Well, Warburton,'\nhe said, 'if he's good enough for you he's good enough for me. Send him\nalong.'\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen there was Monte Carlo, where Mr. Warburton and the Grand Duke\nFyodor, playing in partnership, had broken the bank one evening; and\nthere was Marienbad. At Marienbad Mr. Warburton had played baccarat with\nEdward VII.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was only Prince of Wales then, of course. I remember him saying to\nme, 'George, if you draw on a five you'll lose your shirt.' He was\nright; I don't think he ever said a truer word in his life. He was a\nwonderful man. I always said he was the greatest diplomatist in Europe.\nBut I was a young fool in those days, I hadn't the sense to take his\nadvice. If I had, if I'd never drawn on a five, I dare say I shouldn't\nbe here to-day.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCooper was watching him. His brown eyes, deep in their sockets, were\nhard and supercilious, and on his lips was a mocking smile. He had heard\na good deal about Mr. Warburton in Kuala Solor, not a bad sort, and he\nran his district like clockwork, they said, but by heaven, what a snob!\nThey laughed at him good-naturedly, for it was impossible to dislike a\nman who was so generous and so kindly, and Cooper had already heard the\nstory of the Prince of Wales and the game of baccarat. But Cooper\nlistened without indulgence. From the beginning he had resented the\nResident's manner. He was very sensitive, and he writhed under Mr.\nWarburton's polite sarcasms. Mr. Warburton had a knack of receiving a\nremark of which he disapproved with a devastating silence. Cooper had\nlived little in England and he had a peculiar dislike of the English. He\nresented especially the public-school boy since he always feared that he\nwas going to patronise him. He was so much afraid of others putting on\nairs with him that, in order as it were to get in first, he put on such\nairs as to make everyone think him insufferably conceited.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, at all events the war has done one good thing for us,\" he said at\nlast. \"It's smashed up the power of the aristocracy. The Boer War\nstarted it, and 1914 put the lid on.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The great families of England are doomed,\" said Mr. Warburton with the\ncomplacent melancholy of an <i>émigré</i> who remembered the court of Louis\nXV. \"They cannot afford any longer to live in their splendid palaces and\ntheir princely hospitality will soon be nothing but a memory.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And a damned good job too in my opinion.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"My poor Cooper, what can you know of the glory that was Greece and the\ngrandeur that was Rome?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton made an ample gesture. His eyes for an instant grew dreamy\nwith a vision of the past.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, believe me, we're fed up with all that rot. What we want is a\nbusiness government by business men. I was born in a Crown Colony, and\nI've lived practically all my life in the colonies. I don't give a row\nof pins for a lord. What's wrong with England is snobbishness. And if\nthere's anything that gets my goat it's a snob.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA snob! Mr. Warburton's face grew purple and his eyes blazed with anger.\nThat was a word that had pursued him all his life. The great ladies\nwhose society he had enjoyed in his youth were not inclined to look upon\nhis appreciation of themselves as unworthy, but even great ladies are\nsometimes out of temper and more than once Mr. Warburton had had the\ndreadful word flung in his teeth. He knew, he could not help knowing,\nthat there were odious people who called him a snob. How unfair it was!\nWhy, there was no vice he found so detestable as snobbishness. After\nall, he liked to mix with people of his own class, he was only at home\nin their company, and how in heaven's name could anyone say that was\nsnobbish? Birds of a feather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I quite agree with you,\" he answered. \"A snob is a man who admires or\ndespises another because he is of a higher social rank than his own. It\nis the most vulgar failing of our English middle-class.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe saw a flicker of amusement in Cooper's eyes. Cooper put up his hand\nto hide the broad smile that rose to his lips, and so made it more\nnoticeable. Mr. Warburton's hands trembled a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nProbably Cooper never knew how greatly he had offended his chief. A\nsensitive man himself he was strangely insensitive to the feelings of\nothers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTheir work forced them to see one another for a few minutes now and then\nduring the day, and they met at six to have a drink on Mr. Warburton's\nverandah. This was an old-established custom of the country which Mr.\nWarburton would not for the world have broken. But they ate their meals\nseparately, Cooper in his bungalow and Mr. Warburton at the Fort. After\nthe office work was over they walked till dusk fell, but they walked\napart. There were but few paths in this country where the jungle pressed\nclose upon the plantations of the village, and when Mr. Warburton caught\nsight of his assistant passing along with his loose stride, he would\nmake a circuit in order to avoid him. Cooper with his bad manners, his\nconceit in his own judgment and his intolerance had already got on his\nnerves; but it was not till Cooper had been on the station for a couple\nof months that an incident happened which turned the Resident's dislike\ninto bitter hatred.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton was obliged to go up-country on a tour of inspection, and\nhe left the station in Cooper's charge with more confidence, since he\nhad definitely come to the conclusion that he was a capable fellow. The\nonly thing he did not like was that he had no indulgence. He was honest,\njust and painstaking, but he had no sympathy for the natives. It\nbitterly amused Mr. Warburton to observe that this man who looked upon\nhimself as every man's equal should look upon so many men as his own\ninferiors. He was hard, he had no patience with the native mind, and he\nwas a bully. Mr. Warburton very quickly realised that the Malays\ndisliked and feared him. He was not altogether displeased. He would not\nhave liked it very much if his assistant had enjoyed a popularity which\nmight rival his own. Mr. Warburton made his elaborate preparations, set\nout on his expedition, and in three weeks returned. Meanwhile the mail\nhad arrived. The first thing that struck his eyes when he entered his\nsitting-room was a great pile of open newspapers. Cooper had met him,\nand they went into the room together. Mr. Warburton turned to one of the\nservants who had been left behind, and sternly asked him what was the\nmeaning of those open papers. Cooper hastened to explain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wanted to read all about the Wolverhampton murder, and so I borrowed\nyour <i>Times</i>. I brought them back again. I knew you wouldn't mind.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton turned on him, white with anger.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But I do mind. I mind very much.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Cooper, with composure. \"The fact is, I simply\ncouldn't wait till you came back.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I wonder you didn't open my letters as well.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCooper, unmoved, smiled at his chief's exasperation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, that's not quite the same thing. After all, I couldn't imagine\nyou'd mind my looking at your newspapers. There's nothing private in\nthem.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I very much object to anyone reading my paper before me.\" He went up to\nthe pile. There were nearly thirty numbers there. \"I think it extremely\nimpertinent of you. They're all mixed up.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We can easily put them in order,\" said Cooper, joining him at the\ntable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't touch them,\" cried Mr. Warburton.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I say, it's childish to make a scene about a little thing like that.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"How dare you speak to me like that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, go to hell,\" said Cooper, and he flung out of the room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton, trembling with passion, was left contemplating his\npapers. His greatest pleasure in life had been destroyed by those\ncallous, brutal hands. Most people living in out-of-the-way places when\nthe mail comes tear open impatiently their papers and taking the last\nones first glance at the latest news from home. Not so Mr. Warburton.\nHis newsagent had instructions to write on the outside of the wrapper\nthe date of each paper he despatched, and when the great bundle arrived\nMr. Warburton looked at these dates and with his blue pencil numbered\nthem. His head-boy's orders were to place one on the table every morning\nin the verandah with the early cup of tea and it was Mr. Warburton's\nespecial delight to break the wrapper as he sipped his tea, and read the\nmorning paper. It gave him the illusion of living at home. Every Monday\nmorning he read the Monday <i>Times</i> of six weeks back, and so went\nthrough the week. On Sunday he read the <i>Observer</i>. Like his habit of\ndressing for dinner it was a tie to civilisation. And it was his pride\nthat no matter how exciting the news was he had never yielded to the\ntemptation of opening a paper before its allotted time. During the war\nthe suspense sometimes had been intolerable, and when he read one day\nthat a push was begun he had undergone agonies of suspense which he\nmight have saved himself by the simple expedient of opening a later\npaper which lay waiting for him on a shelf. It had been the severest\ntrial to which he had ever exposed himself, but he victoriously\nsurmounted it. And that clumsy fool had broken open those neat tight\npackages because he wanted to know whether some horrid woman had\nmurdered her odious husband.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton sent for his boy and told him to bring wrappers. He folded\nup the papers as neatly as he could, placed a wrapper round each and\nnumbered it. But it was a melancholy task.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I shall never forgive him,\" he said. \"Never.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course his boy had been with him on his expedition; he never\ntravelled without him, for his boy knew exactly how he liked things, and\nMr. Warburton was not the kind of jungle traveller who was prepared to\ndispense with his comforts; but in the interval since their arrival he\nhad been gossiping in the servants' quarters. He had learnt that Cooper\nhad had trouble with his boys. All but the youth Abas had left him. Abas\nhad desired to go too, but his uncle had placed him there on the\ninstructions of the Resident, and he was afraid to leave without his\nuncle's permission.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I told him he had done well, Tuan,\" said the boy. \"But he is unhappy.\nHe says it is not a good house, and he wishes to know if he may go as\nthe others have gone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, he must stay. The Tuan must have servants. Have those who went been\nreplaced?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, Tuan, no one will go.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton frowned. Cooper was an insolent fool, but he had an\nofficial position and must be suitably provided with servants. It was\nnot seemly that his house should be improperly conducted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where are the boys who ran away?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They are in the kampong, Tuan.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go and see them to-night, and tell them that I expect them to be back\nin Tuan Cooper's house at dawn to-morrow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They say they will not go, Tuan.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"On my order?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe boy had been with Mr. Warburton for fifteen years, and he knew every\nintonation of his master's voice. He was not afraid of him, they had\ngone through too much together, once in the jungle the Resident had\nsaved his life, and once, upset in some rapids, but for him the Resident\nwould have been drowned; but he knew when the Resident must be obeyed\nwithout question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I will go to the kampong,\" he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton expected that his subordinate would take the first\nopportunity to apologise for his rudeness, but Cooper had the ill-bred\nman's inability to express regret; and when they met next morning in the\noffice he ignored the incident. Since Mr. Warburton had been away for\nthree weeks it was necessary for them to have a somewhat prolonged\ninterview. At the end of it, Mr. Warburton dismissed him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't think there's anything else, thank you.\" Cooper turned to go,\nbut Mr. Warburton stopped him. \"I understand you've been having some\ntrouble with your boys.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCooper gave a harsh laugh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They tried to blackmail me. They had the damned cheek to run away, all\nexcept that incompetent fellow Abas--he knew when he was well off--but I\njust sat tight. They've all come to heel again.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"This morning they were all back on their jobs, the Chinese cook and\nall. There they were, as cool as cucumbers; you would have thought they\nowned the place. I suppose they'd come to the conclusion that I wasn't\nsuch a fool as I looked.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"By no means. They came back on my express order.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCooper flushed slightly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should be obliged if you wouldn't interfere with my private\nconcerns.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"They're not your private concerns. When your servants run away it makes\nyou ridiculous. You are perfectly free to make a fool of yourself, but I\ncannot allow you to be made a fool of. It is unseemly that your house\nshould not be properly staffed. As soon as I heard that your boys had\nleft you, I had them told to be back in their places at dawn. That'll\ndo.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton nodded to signify that the interview was at an end. Cooper\ntook no notice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shall I tell you what I did? I called them and gave the whole bally lot\nthe sack. I gave them ten minutes to get out of the compound.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton shrugged his shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What makes you think you can get others?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've told my own clerk to see about it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton reflected for a moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think you behaved very foolishly. You will do well to remember in\nfuture that good masters make good servants.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Is there anything else you want to teach me?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should like to teach you manners, but it would be an arduous task,\nand I have not the time to waste. I will see that you get boys.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Please don't put yourself to any trouble on my account. I'm quite\ncapable of getting them for myself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton smiled acidly. He had an inkling that Cooper disliked him\nas much as he disliked Cooper, and he knew that nothing is more galling\nthan to be forced to accept the favours of a man you detest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Allow me to tell you that you have no more chance of getting Malay or\nChinese servants here now than you have of getting an English butler or\na French chef. No one will come to you except on an order from me. Would\nyou like me to give it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"As you please. Good-morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton watched the development of the situation with acrid\nhumour. Cooper's clerk was unable to persuade Malay, Dyak or Chinese to\nenter the house of such a master. Abas, the boy who remained faithful to\nhim, knew how to cook only native food, and Cooper, a coarse feeder,\nfound his gorge rise against the everlasting rice. There was no\nwater-carrier, and in that great heat he needed several baths a day. He\ncursed Abas, but Abas opposed him with sullen resistance and would not\ndo more than he chose. It was galling to know that the lad stayed with\nhim only because the Resident insisted. This went on for a fortnight and\nthen, one morning, he found in his house the very servants whom he had\npreviously dismissed. He fell into a violent rage, but he had learnt a\nlittle sense, and this time, without a word, he let them stay. He\nswallowed his humiliation, but the impatient contempt he had felt for\nMr. Warburton's idiosyncrasies changed into a sullen hatred: the\nResident with this malicious stroke had made him the laughing-stock of\nall the natives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe two men now held no communication with one another. They broke the\ntime-honoured custom of sharing, notwithstanding personal dislike, a\ndrink at six o'clock with any white man who happened to be at the\nstation. Each lived in his own house as though the other did not exist.\nNow that Cooper had fallen into the work, it was necessary for them to\nhave little to do with one another in the office. Mr. Warburton used his\norderly to send any message he had to give his assistant, and his\ninstructions he sent by formal letter. They saw one another constantly,\nthat was inevitable, but did not exchange half a dozen words in a week.\nThe fact that they could not avoid catching sight of one another got on\ntheir nerves. They brooded over their antagonism, and Mr. Warburton,\ntaking his daily walk, could think of nothing but how much he detested\nhis assistant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd the dreadful thing was that in all probability they would remain\nthus, facing each other in deadly enmity, till Mr. Warburton went on\nleave. It might be three years. He had no reason to send in a complaint\nto headquarters: Cooper did his work very well, and at that time men\nwere hard to get. True, vague complaints reached him and hints that the\nnatives found Cooper harsh. There was certainly a feeling of\ndissatisfaction among them. But when Mr. Warburton looked into specific\ncases, all he could say was that Cooper had shown severity where\nmildness would not have been misplaced, and had been unfeeling when\nhimself would have been sympathetic. He had done nothing for which he\ncould be taken to task. But Mr. Warburton watched him. Hatred will often\nmake a man clear-sighted, and he had a suspicion that Cooper was using\nthe natives without consideration, yet keeping within the law, because\nhe felt that thus he could exasperate his chief. One day perhaps he\nwould go too far. None knew better than Mr. Warburton how irritable the\nincessant heat could make a man and how difficult it was to keep one's\nself-control after a sleepless night. He smiled softly to himself.\nSooner or later Cooper would deliver himself into his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen at last the opportunity came, Mr. Warburton laughed aloud. Cooper\nhad charge of the prisoners; they made roads, built sheds, rowed when it\nwas necessary to send the prahu up or down stream, kept the town clean\nand otherwise usefully employed themselves. If well-behaved they even on\noccasion served as house-boys. Cooper kept them hard at it. He liked to\nsee them work. He took pleasure in devising tasks for them; and seeing\nquickly enough that they were being made to do useless things the\nprisoners worked badly. He punished them by lengthening their hours.\nThis was contrary to the regulations, and as soon as it was brought to\nthe attention of Mr. Warburton, without referring the matter back to his\nsubordinate, he gave instructions that the old hours should be kept;\nCooper, going out for his walk, was astounded to see the prisoners\nstrolling back to the gaol; he had given instructions that they were not\nto knock off till dusk. When he asked the warder in charge why they had\nleft off work he was told that it was the Resident's bidding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhite with rage he strode to the Fort. Mr. Warburton, in his spotless\nwhite ducks and his neat topee, with a walking-stick in his hand,\nfollowed by his dogs, was on the point of starting out on his afternoon\nstroll. He had watched Cooper go, and knew that he had taken the road by\nthe river. Cooper jumped up the steps and went straight up to the\nResident.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I want to know what the hell you mean by countermanding my order that\nthe prisoners were to work till six,\" he burst out, beside himself with\nfury.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton opened his cold blue eyes very wide and assumed an\nexpression of great surprise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Are you out of your mind? Are you so ignorant that you do not know that\nthat is not the way to speak to your official superior?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, go to hell. The prisoners are my pidgin, and you've got no right to\ninterfere. You mind your business and I'll mind mine. I want to know\nwhat the devil you mean by making a damned fool of me. Everyone in the\nplace will know that you've countermanded my order.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton kept very cool.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You had no power to give the order you did. I countermanded it because\nit was harsh and tyrannical. Believe me, I have not made half such a\ndamned fool of you as you have made of yourself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You disliked me from the first moment I came here. You've done\neverything you could to make the place impossible for me because I\nwouldn't lick your boots for you. You got your knife into me because I\nwouldn't flatter you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCooper, spluttering with rage, was nearing dangerous ground, and Mr.\nWarburton's eyes grew on a sudden colder and more piercing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You are wrong. I thought you were a cad, but I was perfectly satisfied\nwith the way you did your work.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You snob. You damned snob. You thought me a cad because I hadn't been\nto Eton. Oh, they told me in K.S. what to expect. Why, don't you know\nthat you're the laughing-stock of the whole country? I could hardly help\nbursting into a roar of laughter when you told your celebrated story\nabout the Prince of Wales. My God, how they shouted at the club when\nthey told it. By God, I'd rather be the cad I am than the snob you are.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got Mr. Warburton on the raw.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"If you don't get out of my house this minute I shall knock you down,\"\nhe cried.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe other came a little closer to him and put his face in his.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Touch me, touch me,\" he said. \"By God, I'd like to see you hit me. Do\nyou want me to say it again? Snob. Snob.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCooper was three inches taller than Mr. Warburton, a strong, muscular\nyoung man. Mr. Warburton was fat and fifty-four. His clenched fist shot\nout. Cooper caught him by the arm and pushed him back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Don't be a damned fool. Remember I'm not a gentleman. I know how to use\nmy hands.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe gave a sort of hoot, and grinning all over his pale, sharp face\njumped down the verandah steps. Mr. Warburton, his heart in his anger\npounding against his ribs, sank exhausted into a chair. His body tingled\nas though he had prickly heat. For one horrible moment he thought he was\ngoing to cry. But suddenly he was conscious that his head-boy was on the\nverandah and instinctively regained control of himself. The boy came\nforward and filled him a glass of whisky and soda. Without a word Mr.\nWarburton took it and drank it to the dregs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you want to say to me?\" asked Mr. Warburton, trying to force a\nsmile on to his strained lips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tuan, the assistant Tuan is a bad man. Abas wishes again to leave him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let him wait a little. I shall write to Kuala Solor and ask that Tuan\nCooper should go elsewhere.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tuan Cooper is not good with the Malays.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Leave me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe boy silently withdrew. Mr. Warburton was left alone with his\nthoughts. He saw the club at Kuala Solor, the men sitting round the\ntable in the window in their flannels, when the night had driven them in\nfrom golf and tennis, drinking whiskies and gin pahits, and laughing\nwhen they told the celebrated story of the Prince of Wales and himself\nat Marienbad. He was hot with shame and misery. A snob! They all thought\nhim a snob. And he had always thought them very good fellows, he had\nalways been gentleman enough to let it make no difference to him that\nthey were of very second-rate position. He hated them now. But his\nhatred for them was nothing compared with his hatred for Cooper. And if\nit had come to blows Cooper could have thrashed him. Tears of\nmortification ran down his red, fat face. He sat there for a couple of\nhours smoking cigarette after cigarette, and he wished he were dead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt last the boy came back and asked him if he would dress for dinner. Of\ncourse! He always dressed for dinner. He rose wearily from his chair and\nput on his stiff shirt and the high collar. He sat down at the prettily\ndecorated table, and was waited on as usual by the two boys while two\nothers waved their great fans. Over there in the bungalow, two hundred\nyards away, Cooper was eating a filthy meal clad only in a sarong and a\nbaju. His feet were bare and while he ate he probably read a detective\nstory. After dinner Mr. Warburton sat down to write a letter. The Sultan\nwas away, but he wrote, privately and confidentially, to his\nrepresentative. Cooper did his work very well, he said, but the fact was\nthat he couldn't get on with him. They were getting dreadfully on each\nother's nerves and he would look upon it as a very great favour if\nCooper could be transferred to another post.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe despatched the letter next morning by special messenger. The answer\ncame a fortnight later with the month's mail. It was a private note, and\nran as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>\n    \"My dear Warburton,\n<br>\n&nbsp;\n<br>\n    \"I do not want to answer your letter officially, and so I am\n    writing you a few lines myself. Of course if you insist I will\n    put the matter up to the Sultan, but I think you would be much\n    wiser to drop it. I know Cooper is a rough diamond, but he is\n    capable, and he had a pretty thin time in the war, and I think\n    he should be given every chance. I think you are a little too\n    much inclined to attach importance to a man's social position.\n    You must remember that times have changed. Of course it's a very\n    good thing for a man to be a gentleman, but it's better that he\n    should be competent and hard-working. I think if you'll exercise\n    a little tolerance you'll get on very well with Cooper.\n<br>\n&nbsp;\n<br>\n    \"Yours very sincerely,\n<br>\n    \"Richard Temple.\"\n</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThe letter dropped from Mr. Warburton's hand. It was easy to read\nbetween the lines. Dick Temple, whom he had known for twenty years, Dick\nTemple who came from quite a good county family, thought him a snob, and\nfor that reason had no patience with his request. Mr. Warburton felt on\na sudden discouraged with life. The world of which he was a part had\npassed away and the future belonged to a meaner generation. Cooper\nrepresented it and Cooper he hated with all his heart. He stretched out\nhis hand to fill his glass, and at the gesture his head-boy stepped\nforward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know you were there.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe boy picked up the official letter. Ah, that was why he was waiting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Does Tuan Cooper go, Tuan?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"There will be a misfortune.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a moment the words conveyed nothing to his lassitude. But only for a\nmoment. He sat up in his chair and looked at the boy. He was all\nattention.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tuan Cooper is not behaving rightly with Abas.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton shrugged his shoulders. How should a man like Cooper know\nhow to treat servants? Mr. Warburton knew the type: he would be grossly\nfamiliar with them at one moment and rude and inconsiderate the next.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let Abas go back to his family.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tuan Cooper holds back his wages so that he may not run away. He has\npaid him nothing for three months. I tell him to be patient. But he is\nangry, he will not listen to reason. If the Tuan continues to use him\nill there will be a misfortune.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You were right to tell me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe fool! Did he know so little of the Malays as to think he could\nsafely injure them? It would serve him damned well right if he got a\nkris in his back. A kris. Mr. Warburton's heart seemed on a sudden to\nmiss a beat. He had only to let things take their course and one fine\nday he would be rid of Cooper. He smiled faintly as the phrase, a\nmasterly inactivity, crossed his mind. And now his heart beat a little\nquicker, for he saw the man he hated lying on his face in a pathway of\nthe jungle with a knife in his back. A fit end for the cad and the\nbully. Mr. Warburton sighed. It was his duty to warn him, and of course\nhe must do it. He wrote a brief and formal note to Cooper asking him to\ncome to the Fort at once.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn ten minutes Cooper stood before him. They had not spoken to one\nanother since the day when Mr. Warburton had nearly struck him. He did\nnot now ask him to sit down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Did you wish to see me?\" asked Cooper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was untidy and none too clean. His face and hands were covered with\nlittle red blotches where mosquitoes had bitten him and he had scratched\nhimself till the blood came. His long, thin face bore a sullen look.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I understand that you are again having trouble with your servants.\nAbas, my head-boy's nephew, complains that you have held back his wages\nfor three months. I consider it a most arbitrary proceeding. The lad\nwishes to leave you, and I certainly do not blame him. I must insist on\nyour paying what is due to him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't choose that he should leave me. I am holding back his wages as\na pledge of his good behaviour.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You do not know the Malay character. The Malays are very sensitive to\ninjury and ridicule. They are passionate and revengeful. It is my duty\nto warn you that if you drive this boy beyond a certain point you run a\ngreat risk.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCooper gave a contemptuous chuckle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you think he'll do?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I think he'll kill you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Why should you mind?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, I wouldn't,\" replied Mr. Warburton, with a faint laugh. \"I should\nbear it with the utmost fortitude. But I feel the official obligation to\ngive you a proper warning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Do you think I'm afraid of a damned nigger?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a matter of entire indifference to me.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, let me tell you this, I know how to take care of myself; that boy\nAbas is a dirty, thieving rascal, and if he tries any monkey tricks on\nme, by God, I'll wring his bloody neck.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That was all I wished to say to you,\" said Mr. Warburton.\n\"Good-evening.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton gave him a little nod of dismissal. Cooper flushed, did\nnot for a moment know what to say or do, turned on his heel and stumbled\nout of the room. Mr. Warburton watched him go with an icy smile on his\nlips. He had done his duty. But what would he have thought had he known\nthat when Cooper got back to his bungalow, so silent and cheerless, he\nthrew himself down on his bed and in his bitter loneliness on a sudden\nlost all control of himself? Painful sobs tore his chest and heavy tears\nrolled down his thin cheeks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter this Mr. Warburton seldom saw Cooper, and never spoke to him. He\nread his <i>Times</i> every morning, did his work at the office, took his\nexercise, dressed for dinner, dined and sat by the river smoking his\ncheroot. If by chance he ran across Cooper he cut him dead. Each, though\nnever for a moment unconscious of the propinquity, acted as though the\nother did not exist. Time did nothing to assuage their animosity. They\nwatched one another's actions and each knew what the other did. Though\nMr. Warburton had been a keen shot in his youth, with age he had\nacquired a distaste for killing the wild things of the jungle, but on\nSundays and holidays Cooper went out with his gun: if he got something\nit was a triumph over Mr. Warburton; if not, Mr. Warburton shrugged his\nshoulders and chuckled. These counter-jumpers trying to be sportsmen!\nChristmas was a bad time for both of them: they ate their dinners alone,\neach in his own quarters, and they got deliberately drunk. They were the\nonly white men within two hundred miles and they lived within shouting\ndistance of each other. At the beginning of the year Cooper went down\nwith fever, and when Mr. Warburton caught sight of him again he was\nsurprised to see how thin he had grown. He looked ill and worn. The\nsolitude, so much more unnatural because it was due to no necessity, was\ngetting on his nerves. It was getting on Mr. Warburton's too, and often\nhe could not sleep at night. He lay awake brooding. Cooper was drinking\nheavily and surely the breaking point was near; but in his dealings with\nthe natives he took care to do nothing that might expose him to his\nchief's rebuke. They fought a grim and silent battle with one another.\nIt was a test of endurance. The months passed, and neither gave sign of\nweakening. They were like men dwelling in regions of eternal night, and\ntheir souls were oppressed with the knowledge that never would the day\ndawn for them. It looked as though their lives would continue for ever\nin this dull and hideous monotony of hatred.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd when at last the inevitable happened it came upon Mr. Warburton with\nall the shock of the unexpected. Cooper accused the boy Abas of stealing\nsome of his clothes, and when the boy denied the theft took him by the\nscruff of the neck and kicked him down the steps of the bungalow. The\nboy demanded his wages and Cooper flung at his head every word of abuse\nhe knew. If he saw him in the compound in an hour he would hand him over\nto the police. Next morning the boy waylaid him outside the Fort when he\nwas walking over to his office, and again demanded his wages. Cooper\nstruck him in the face with his clenched fist. The boy fell to the\nground and got up with blood streaming from his nose.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCooper walked on and set about his work. But he could not attend to it.\nThe blow had calmed his irritation, and he knew that he had gone too\nfar. He was worried. He felt ill, miserable and discouraged. In the\nadjoining office sat Mr. Warburton, and his impulse was to go and tell\nhim what he had done; he made a movement in his chair, but he knew with\nwhat icy scorn he would listen to the story. He could see his\npatronising smile. For a moment he had an uneasy fear of what Abas might\ndo. Warburton had warned him all right. He sighed. What a fool he had\nbeen! But he shrugged his shoulders impatiently. He did not care; a fat\nlot he had to live for. It was all Warburton's fault; if he hadn't put\nhis back up nothing like this would have happened. Warburton had made\nlife a hell for him from the start. The snob. But they were all like\nthat: it was because he was a Colonial. It was a damned shame that he\nhad never got his commission in the war; he was as good as anyone else.\nThey were a lot of dirty snobs. He was damned if he was going to knuckle\nunder now. Of course Warburton would hear of what had happened; the old\ndevil knew everything. He wasn't afraid. He wasn't afraid of any Malay\nin Borneo, and Warburton could go to blazes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was right in thinking that Mr. Warburton would know what had\nhappened. His head-boy told him when he went in to tiffin.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where is your nephew now?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I do not know, Tuan. He has gone.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton remained silent. After luncheon as a rule he slept a\nlittle, but to-day he found himself very wide awake. His eyes\ninvoluntarily sought the bungalow where Cooper was now resting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe idiot! Hesitation for a little was in Mr. Warburton's mind. Did the\nman know in what peril he was? He supposed he ought to send for him. But\neach time he had tried to reason with Cooper, Cooper had insulted him.\nAnger, furious anger welled up suddenly in Mr. Warburton's heart, so\nthat the veins on his temples stood out and he clenched his fists. The\ncad had had his warning. Now let him take what was coming to him. It was\nno business of his, and if anything happened it was not his fault. But\nperhaps they would wish in Kuala Solor that they had taken his advice\nand transferred Cooper to another station.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe was strangely restless that night. After dinner he walked up and down\nthe verandah. When the boy went away to his own quarters, Mr. Warburton\nasked him whether anything had been seen of Abas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, Tuan, I think maybe he has gone to the village of his mother's\nbrother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton gave him a sharp glance, but the boy was looking down, and\ntheir eyes did not meet. Mr. Warburton went down to the river and sat in\nhis arbour. But peace was denied him. The river flowed ominously silent.\nIt was like a great serpent gliding with sluggish movement towards the\nsea. And the trees of the jungle over the water were heavy with a\nbreathless menace. No bird sang. No breeze ruffled the leaves of the\ncassias. All around him it seemed as though something waited.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe walked across the garden to the road. He had Cooper's bungalow in\nfull view from there. There was a light in his sitting-room, and across\nthe road floated the sound of ragtime. Cooper was playing his\ngramophone. Mr. Warburton shuddered; he had never got over his\ninstinctive dislike of that instrument. But for that he would have gone\nover and spoken to Cooper. He turned and went back to his own house. He\nread late into the night, and at last he slept. But he did not sleep\nvery long, he had terrible dreams, and he seemed to be awakened by a\ncry. Of course that was a dream too, for no cry--from the bungalow for\ninstance--could be heard in his room. He lay awake till dawn. Then he\nheard hurried steps and the sound of voices, his head-boy burst suddenly\ninto the room without his fez, and Mr. Warburton's heart stood still.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tuan, Tuan.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton jumped out of bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I'll come at once.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe put on his slippers, and in his sarong and pyjama-jacket walked\nacross his compound and into Cooper's. Cooper was lying in bed, with his\nmouth open, and a kris sticking in his heart. He had been killed in his\nsleep. Mr. Warburton started, but not because he had not expected to see\njust such a sight, he started because he felt in himself a sudden glow\nof exultation. A great burden had been lifted from his shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCooper was quite cold. Mr. Warburton took the kris out of the wound, it\nhad been thrust in with such force that he had to use an effort to get\nit out, and looked at it. He recognised it. It was a kris that a dealer\nhad offered him some weeks before, and which he knew Cooper had bought.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Where is Abas?\" he asked sternly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Abas is at the village of his mother's brother.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe sergeant of the native police was standing at the foot of the bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Take two men and go to the village and arrest him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton did what was immediately necessary. With set face he gave\norders. His words were short and peremptory. Then he went back to the\nFort. He shaved and had his bath, dressed and went into the dining-room.\nBy the side of his plate <i>The Times</i> in its wrapper lay waiting for him.\nHe helped himself to some fruit. The head-boy poured out his tea while\nthe second handed him a dish of eggs. Mr. Warburton ate with a good\nappetite. The head-boy waited.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is it?\" asked Mr. Warburton.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tuan, Abas, my nephew, was in the house of his mother's brother all\nnight. It can be proved. His uncle will swear that he did not leave the\nkampong.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton turned upon him with a frown.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tuan Cooper was killed by Abas. You know it as well as I know it.\nJustice must be done.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tuan, you would not hang him?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Warburton hesitated an instant, and though his voice remained set\nand stern a change came into his eyes. It was a flicker which the Malay\nwas quick to notice and across his own eyes flashed an answering look of\nunderstanding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The provocation was very great. Abas will be sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment.\" There was a pause while Mr. Warburton helped himself to\nmarmalade. \"When he has served a part of his sentence in prison I will\ntake him into this house as a boy. You can train him in his duties. I\nhave no doubt that in the house of Tuan Cooper he got into bad habits.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Shall Abas give himself up, Tuan?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It would be wise of him.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe boy withdrew. Mr. Warburton took his <i>Times</i> and neatly slit the\nwrapper. He loved to unfold the heavy, rustling pages. The morning, so\nfresh and cool, was delicious and for a moment his eyes wandered out\nover the garden with a friendly glance. A great weight had been lifted\nfrom his mind. He turned to the columns in which were announced the\nbirths, deaths, and marriages. That was what he always looked at first.\nA name he knew caught his attention. Lady Ormskirk had had a son at\nlast. By George, how pleased the old dowager must be! He would write her\na note of congratulation by the next mail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAbas would make a very good house-boy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThat fool Cooper!\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI arrived in Seoul towards evening and after dinner, tired by the long\nrailway journey from Peking, to stretch my cramped legs I went for a\nwalk. I wandered at random along a narrow and busy street. The Koreans\nin their long white gowns and their little white top-hats were amusing\nto look at and the open shops displayed wares that arrested my foreign\neyes. Presently I came to a second-hand bookseller's and catching sight\nof shelves filled with English books went in to have a look at them. I\nglanced at the titles and my heart sank. They were commentaries on the\nOld Testament, treatises on the Epistles of St. Paul, sermons and lives\nof divines doubtless eminent, but whose names were unfamiliar to me; I\nam an ignorant person. I supposed that this was the library of some\nmissionary whom death had claimed in the midst of his labours and whose\nbooks then had been purchased by a Japanese bookseller. The Japanese are\nastute, but I could not imagine who in Seoul would be found to buy a\nwork in three volumes on the Epistle to the Corinthians. But as I was\nturning away, between volume two and volume three of this treatise I\nnoticed a little book bound in paper. I do not know what induced me to\ntake it out. It was called the <i>Complete Poker Player</i> and its cover was\nillustrated with a hand holding four aces. I looked at the title-page.\nThe author was Mr. John Blackbridge, actuary and counseller-at-law, and\nthe preface was dated 1879. I wondered how this work happened to be\namong the books of a deceased missionary and I looked in one or two of\nthem to see if I could find his name. Perhaps it was there only by\naccident. It may be that it was the entire library of a stranded gambler\nand had found its way to those shelves when his effects were sold to pay\nhis hotel bill. But I preferred to think that it was indeed the property\nof the missionary and that when he was weary of reading divinity he\nrested his mind by the perusal of these lively pages. Perhaps somewhere\nin Korea, at night and alone in his mission-house, he dealt innumerable\npoker hands in order to see for himself whether you could really only\nget a straight flush once in sixty-five thousand hands. But the owner of\nthe shop was looking at me with disfavour so I turned to him and asked\nthe price of the book. He gave it a contemptuous glance and told me I\ncould have it for twenty sen. I put it in my pocket.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI do not remember that for so small a sum I have ever purchased better\nentertainment. For Mr. John Blackbridge in these pages of his did a\nthing that no writer can do who deliberately tries to, but that, if done\nunconsciously, gives a book a rare and precious savour; he painted a\ncomplete portrait of himself. He stands before the reader so vividly\nthat I was convinced that a wood-cut of him figured as a frontispiece\nand I was surprised to discover, on looking at the book again the other\nday, that there was nothing of the kind. I see him very distinctly as a\nman of middle-age, in a black frock-coat and a chimney-pot hat, wearing\na black satin stock; he is clean-shaven and his jaw is square; his lips\nare thin and his eyes wary; his face is sallow and somewhat wrinkled. It\nis a countenance not without severity, but when he tells a story or\nmakes one of his dry jokes his eyes light up and his smile is winning.\nHe enjoyed his bottle of Burgundy, but I cannot believe that he ever\ndrank enough to confuse his excellent faculties. He was just rather than\nmerciful at the card-table and he was prepared to punish presumption\nwith rigour. He had few illusions, for here are some of the things that\nlife had taught him: \"Men hate those whom they have injured; men love\nthose whom they have benefited; men naturally avoid their benefactors;\nmen are universally actuated by self-interest; gratitude is a lively\nsense of expected benefits; promises are never forgotten by those to\nwhom they are made, usually by those who make them.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt may be presumed that he was a Southerner, for while speaking of Jack\nPots, which he describes as a frivolous attempt to make the game more\ninteresting, he remarks that they are not popular in the South. \"This\nlast fact,\" he says, \"contains much promise, because the South is the\nconservative portion of the country, and may be relied on as the last\nresort of good sense in social matters. The revolutionary Kossuth made\nno progress below Richmond; neither Spiritualism, nor Free Love, nor\nCommunism, has ever been received with the least favour by the Southern\nmind; and it is for this reason that we greatly respect the Southern\nverdict upon the Jack Pot.\" It was in his day an innovation and he\ncondemned it. \"The time has arrived when all additions to the present\nstandard combinations in Draw Poker must be worthless; the game being\ncomplete. The Jack Pot,\" he says, \"was invented (in Toledo, Ohio) by\nreckless players to compensate losses incurred by playing against\ncautious players; and the principle is the same as if a party should\nplay whist for stakes, and all be obliged every few minutes to stop, and\npurchase tickets in a lottery; or raffle for a turkey; or share a deal\nin Keno.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPoker is a game for gentlemen (he does not hesitate to make frequent use\nof this abused word; he lived in a day when to be a gentleman had its\nobligations but also its privileges) and a straight flush is to be\nrespected, not because you make money on it (\"I have never seen anyone\nmake much money upon a straight flush,\" he says) but \"because it\nprevents any hand from being <i>absolutely</i> the winning hand, and thus\nrelieves gentlemen from the necessity of betting on a certainty. Without\nthe use of straights, and hence without the use of a straight flush,\nfour aces would be a certainty and no gentleman could do more than\n<i>call</i> on them.\" This, I confess, catches me on the raw, for once in my\nlife I had a straight flush, and bet on it till I was called.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. John Blackbridge had personal dignity, rectitude, humour and common\nsense. \"The amusements of mankind,\" he says, \"have not as yet received\nproper recognition at the hands of the makers of the civil law, and of\nthe unwritten social law,\" and he had no patience with the persons who\ncondemn the most agreeable pastime that has been invented, namely\ngambling, because risk is attached to it. Every transaction in life is a\nrisk, he truly observes, and involves the question of loss and gain. \"To\nretire to rest at night is a practice that is fortified by countless\nprecedents, and it is generally regarded as prudent and necessary. Yet\nit is surrounded by risks of every kind.\" He enumerates them and finally\nsums up his argument with these reasonable words: \"If social circles\nwelcome the banker and merchant who live by taking fair risks for the\nsake of profit, there is no apparent reason why they should not at least\ntolerate the man who at times employs himself in giving and taking fair\nrisks for the sake of amusement.\" But here his good sense is obvious.\n\"Twenty years of experience in the city of New York, both professionally\n(you must not forget that he is an actuary and counsellor-at-law) and as\na student of social life, satisfy me that the average American gentleman\nin a large city has not over three thousand dollars a year to spend upon\namusements. Will it be fair to devote more than one-third of this fund\nto cards? I do not think that anyone will say that one-third is not\nample allowance for a single amusement. Given, therefore, a thousand\ndollars a year for the purpose of playing Draw Poker, what should be the\nlimit of the stakes, in order that the average American gentleman may\nplay the game with a contented mind, and with the certainty not only\nthat he can pay his losses, but that his winnings will be paid to him?\"\nMr. Blackbridge has no doubt that the answer is two dollars and a half.\n\"The game of Poker should be intellectual and not emotional; and it is\nimpossible to exclude the emotions from it, if the stakes are so high\nthat the question of loss and gain penetrates to the feelings.\" From\nthis quotation it may be seen that Mr. Blackbridge looked upon poker as\nonly on the side a game of chance. He considered that it needed as much\nforce of character, mental ability, power of decision and insight into\nmotive to play poker as to govern a country or to lead an army, and I\nhave an idea that on the whole he would have thought it a more sensible\nuse of a man's faculties.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI am tempted to quote interminably, for Mr. Blackbridge seldom writes a\nsentence that is other than characteristic, and his language is\nexcellent; it is dignified as befits his subject and his condition (he\ndoes not forget that he is a gentleman), measured, clear and pointed.\nHis phrase takes an ample sweep when he treats of mankind and its\nfoibles, but he can be as direct and simple as you please. Could\nanything be better than this terse but adequate description of a\ncard-sharper? \"He was a very good-looking man of about forty years of\nage, having the appearance of one who had been leading a temperate and\nthoughtful life.\" But I will content myself with giving a few of his\naphorisms and wise saws chosen almost at random from the wealth of his\nbook.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Let your chips talk for you. A silent player is so far forth, a\nmystery; and a mystery is always feared.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In this game never do anything that you are not compelled to; while\ncheerfully responding to your obligations.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"At Draw Poker all statements not called for by the laws of the game, or\nsupported by ocular demonstration, may be set down as fictitious;\ndesigned to enliven the path of truth throughout the game, as flowers in\nsummer enliven the margins of the highway.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Lost money is never recovered. After losing you may win, but the losing\ndoes not bring the winning.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No gentleman will ever play any game of cards with the design of\nhabitually winning and never losing.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"A gentleman is always willing to pay a fair price for recreation and\namusement.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"...that habit of mind which continually leads us to undervalue the\nmental force of other men, while we continually overvalue their good\nluck.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The injury done to your capital by a loss is never compensated by the\nbenefit done to your capital by a gain of the same amount.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Players usually straddle when they are in bad luck, upon the principle\nthat bad play and bad luck united will win. A slight degree of\nintoxication aids to perfect this intellectual deduction.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Euchre is a contemptible game.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The lower cards as well as the lower classes are only useful in\ncombination or in excess, and cannot be depended upon under any other\ncircumstances.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It is a hard matter to hold four Aces as steadily as a pair, but the\ntable will bear their weight with as much equanimity as a pair of\ndeuces.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf good luck and bad luck: \"To feel emotions over such incidents is\nunworthy of a man; and it is much more unworthy to express them. But no\nwords need be wasted over practices which all men despise in others;\nand, in their reflecting moments, lament in themselves.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Endorsing for your friends is a bad habit, but it is nothing to playing\nPoker on credit.... Debit and credit ought never to interfere with\nthe fine intellectual calculations of this game.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere is a grand ring in his remarks on the player who has trained his\nintellect to bring logic to bear upon the principles and phenomena of\nthe game. \"He will thus feel a constant sense of security amid all\npossible fluctuations that occur, and he will also abstain from pressing\nan ignorant or an intellectually weak opponent, beyond what may be\nnecessary either for the purpose of playing the game correctly, or of\npunishing presumption.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI leave Mr. John Blackbridge with this last word and I can hear him\nsaying it gently, but with a tolerant smile:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"For we must take human nature as it is.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI have long had in mind a novel in which a card-sharper was the\nprincipal character; and, going up and down the world, I have kept my\neyes open for members of this profession. Because the idea is prevalent\nthat it is a slightly dishonourable one the persons who follow it do not\nopenly acknowledge the fact. Their reticence is such that it is often\nnot till you have become quite closely acquainted with them, or even\nhave played cards with them two or three times, that you discover in\nwhat fashion they earn their living. But even then they have a\ndisinclination to enlarge upon the mysteries of their craft. They have a\nweakness for passing themselves off for cavalrymen, commercial agents or\nlanded proprietors. This snobbish attitude makes them the most difficult\nclass in the world for the novelist to study. It has been my good\nfortune to meet a number of these gentlemen, and though I have found\nthem affable, obliging and debonair, I have no sooner hinted, however\ndiscreetly, at my curiosity (after all purely professional) in the\ntechnique of their calling than they have grown shy and uncommunicative.\nAn airy reference on my part to stacking the cards has made them assume\nimmediately the appearance of a clam. I am not easily discouraged, and\nlearning by experience that I could hope for no good results from a\ndirect method, I have adopted the oblique. I have been childlike with\nthem and bland. I have found that they gave me their attention and even\ntheir sympathy. Though they confessed honestly that they had never read\na word I had written they were interested by the fact that I was a\nwriter. I suppose they felt obscurely that I too followed a calling that\nthe Philistine regarded without indulgence. But I have been forced to\ngather my facts by a bold surmise. It has needed patience and industry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt may be imagined with what enthusiasm I made the acquaintance a little\nwhile ago of two gentlemen who seemed likely to add appreciably to my\nsmall store of information. I was travelling from Haiphong on a French\nliner going East, and they joined the ship at Hong-Kong. They had gone\nthere for the races and were now on their way back to Shanghai. I was\ngoing there too, and thence to Peking. I soon learned that they had come\nfrom New York for a trip, were bound for Peking also, and by a happy\ncoincidence meant to return to America in the ship in which I had myself\nbooked a passage. I was naturally attracted to them, for they were\npleasant fellows, but it was not till a fellow-passenger warned me that\nthey were professional gamblers that I settled down to complete\nenjoyment of their acquaintance. I had no hope that they would ever\ndiscuss with frankness their interesting occupation, but I expected from\na hint here, from a casual remark there, to learn some very useful\nthings.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne--Campbell was his name--was a man in the late thirties, small, but\nso well built as not to look short, slender, with large, melancholy eyes\nand beautiful hands. But for a premature baldness he would have been\nmore than commonly good-looking. He was neatly dressed. He spoke slowly,\nin a low voice, and his movements were deliberate. The other was made on\nanother pattern. He was a big, burly man with a red face and crisp black\nhair, of powerful appearance, strong in the arm and pugnacious. His name\nwas Peterson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe merits of the combination were obvious. The elegant, exquisite\nCampbell had the subtle brain, the knowledge of character, and the deft\nhands; but the hazards of the card-sharper's life are many, and when it\ncame to a scrap Peterson's ready fist must often have proved invaluable.\nI do not know how it spread through the ship so quickly that a blow of\nPeterson's would stretch any man out. But during the short voyage from\nHong-Kong to Shanghai they never even suggested a game of cards. Perhaps\nthey had done well during the race-week and felt entitled to a holiday.\nThey were certainly enjoying the advantages of not living for the time\nin a dry country and I do not think I do them an injustice if I say that\nfor the most part they were far from sober. Each one talked little of\nhimself but willingly of the other. Campbell informed me that Peterson\nwas one of the most distinguished mining engineers in New York and\nPeterson assured me that Campbell was an eminent banker. He said that\nhis wealth was fabulous. And who was I not to accept ingenuously all\nthat was told me? But I thought it negligent of Campbell not to wear\njewellery of a more expensive character. It seemed to me that to use a\nsilver cigarette case was rather careless.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI stayed but a day in Shanghai, and though I met the pair again in\nPeking I was then so much engaged that I saw little of them. I thought\nit a little odd that Campbell should spend his entire time in the hotel.\nI do not think he even went to see the Temple of Heaven. But I could\nquite understand that from his point of view Peking was unsatisfactory\nand I was not surprised when the pair returned to Shanghai, where, I\nknew the wealthy merchants played for big money. I met them again in the\nship that was to take us across the Pacific and I could not but\nsympathise with my friends when I saw that the passengers were little\ninclined to gamble. There were no rich people among them. It was a dull\ncrowd. Campbell indeed suggested a game of poker, but no one would play\nmore than twenty-dollar table stakes, and Peterson, evidently not\nthinking it worth his while, would not join. Although we played\nafternoon and evening through the journey he sat down with us only on\nthe last day. I suppose he thought he might just as well make his bar\nchits, and this he did very satisfactorily in a single sitting. But\nCampbell evidently loved the game for itself. Of course it is only if\nyou have a passion for the business by which you earn your living that\nyou can make a success of it. The stakes were nothing to him and he\nplayed all day and every day. It fascinated me to see the way in which\nhe dealt the cards, very slowly, with his delicate hands. His eyes\nseemed to bore through the back of each one. He drank heavily, but\nremained quiet and self-controlled. His face was expressionless. I\njudged him to be a perfect card-player and I wished that I could see him\nat work. It increased my esteem for him to see that he could take what\nwas only a relaxation so seriously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI parted with the pair at Victoria and concluded that I should never see\nthem again. I set about sorting my impressions and made notes of the\nvarious points that I thought would prove useful.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen I arrived in New York I found an invitation to luncheon at the Ritz\nwith an old friend of mine. When I went she said to me:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's quite a small party.

The truth flashed across me: Campbell really was\nan opulent banker; Peterson really was a distinguished engineer; they\nwere not card-sharpers at all.

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI am not a bad sailor and when under stress of weather the game broke up\nI did not go below. We were in the habit of playing poker into the small\nhours, a mild game that could hurt nobody, but it had been blowing all\nday and with nightfall the wind strengthened to half a gale. One or two\nof our bunch admitted that they felt none too comfortable and one or two\nothers played with unwonted detachment. But even if you are not sick\ndirty weather at sea is an unpleasant thing. I hate the fool who tells\nyou he loves a storm and tramping the deck lustily vows that it can\nnever be too rough for him. When the woodwork groans and creaks, glasses\ncrash to the floor and you lurch in your chair as the ship heels over,\nwhen the wind howls and the waves thunder against the side, I very much\nprefer dry land. I think no one was sorry when one of the players said\nhe had had enough, and the last round of jack pots was agreed to without\ndemur. I remained alone in the smoking-room, for I knew I should not\neasily get to sleep in that racket and I could not read in bed with any\ncomfort when the North Pacific kept dashing itself against my\nport-holes. I shuffled together the two packs we had been playing with\nand set out a complicated patience.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had been playing about ten minutes when the door was opened with a\nblast of wind that sent my cards flying, and two passengers, rather\nbreathless, slipped into the smoking-room. We were not a full ship and\nwe were ten days out from Hong-Kong, so that I had had time to become\nacquainted with pretty well everyone on board. I had spoken on several\noccasions to the pair who now entered, and seeing me by myself they came\nover to my table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey were very old men, both of them. That perhaps was what had brought\nthem together, for they had first met when they got on board at\nHong-Kong, and now you saw them sitting together in the smoking-room\nmost of the day, not talking very much, but just comfortable to be side\nby side, with a bottle of Vichy water between them. They were very rich\nold men too and that was a bond between them. The rich feel at ease in\none another's company. They know that money means merit. Their\nexperience of the poor is that they always want something. It is true\nthat the poor admire the rich and it is pleasant to be admired, but they\nenvy them as well and this prevents their admiration from being quite\ncandid. Mr. Rosenbaum was a little hunched-up Jew, very frail in clothes\nthat looked too big for him, and he gave you the impression of hanging\non to mortality only by a hair. His ancient, emaciated body looked as\nthough it were already attacked by the corruption of the grave. The only\nexpression his face ever bore was one of cunning, but it was purely\nhabitual, the result of ever so many years astuteness; he was a kindly,\nfriendly person, very free with his drinks and cigars, and his charity\nwas world-famous. The other was called Donaldson. He was a Scot, but had\ngone to California as a little boy and made a great deal of money\nmining. He was short and stout, with a red, clean-shaven, shiny face and\nno hair but a sickle of silver above his neck, and very gentle eyes.\nWhatever force he had had to make his way in the world had been worn\naway by the years and he was now a picture of mild beneficence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I thought you'd turned in long ago,\" I remarked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I should have,\" returned the Scot, \"only Mr. Rosenbaum kept me up\ntalking of old times.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What's the good of going to bed when you can't sleep?\" said Mr.\nRosenbaum.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Walk ten times round the deck with me to-morrow morning and you'll\nsleep all right.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I've never taken any exercise in my life and I'm not going to begin\nnow.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"That's foolishness. You'd be twice the man you are now if you'd taken\nexercise. Look at me. You'd never think I was seventy-nine, would you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Rosenbaum looked critically at Mr. Donaldson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"No, I wouldn't. You're very well preserved. You look younger than me\nand I'm only seventy-six. But then I never had a chance to take care of\nmyself.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment the steward came up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The bar's just going to close, gentlemen. Is there anything I can get\nyou?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's a stormy night,\" said Mr. Rosenbaum. \"Let's have a bottle of\nchampagne.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Small Vichy for me,\" said Mr. Donaldson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Oh, very well, small Vichy for me too.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe steward went away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But mind you,\" continued Mr. Rosenbaum testily, \"I wouldn't have done\nwithout the things you've done without, not for all the money in the\nworld.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Donaldson gave me his gentle smile.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Mr. Rosenbaum can't get over it because I've never touched a card nor a\ndrop of alcohol for fifty-seven years.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Now I ask you, what sort of a life is that?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was a very heavy drinker when I was a young fellow and a desperate\ngambler, but I had a very terrible experience. It was a lesson to me and\nI took it.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Tell him about it,\" said Mr. Rosenbaum. \"He's an author. He'll write it\nup and perhaps he'll be able to make his passage money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It's not a story I like telling very much even now. I'll make it as\nshort as I can. Me and three others had staked out a claim, friends all\nof us, and the oldest wasn't twenty-five; there was me and my partner\nand a couple of brothers, McDermott their name was, but they were more\nlike friends than brothers. What was one's was the other's, and one\nwouldn't go into town without the other went too, and they were always\nlaughing and joking together. A fine clean pair of boys, over six feet\nhigh both of them, and handsome. We were a wild bunch and we had pretty\ngood luck on the whole and when we made money we didn't hesitate to\nspend it. Well, one night we'd all been drinking very heavily and we\nstarted a poker game. I guess we were a good deal drunker than we\nrealised. Anyhow suddenly a row started between the McDermotts. One of\nthem accused the other of cheating. 'You take that back,' cried Jamie.\n'I'll see you in hell first,' says Eddie. And before me and my partner\ncould do anything Jamie had pulled out his gun and shot his brother\ndead.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe ship gave a huge roll and we all clung to our seats. In the\nsteward's pantry there was a great clatter as bottles and glasses slid\nalong a shelf. It was strange to hear that grim little story told by\nthat mild old man. It was a story of another age and you could hardly\nbelieve that this fat, red-faced little fellow, with his silver fringe\nof hair, in a dinner jacket, two large pearls in his shirt-front, had\nreally taken part in it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What happened then?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We sobered up pretty quick. At first Jamie couldn't believe Eddie was\ndead. He took him in his arms and kept calling him. 'Eddie,' he says,\n'wake up, old boy, wake up.' He cried all night and next day we rode in\nwith him to town, forty miles it was, me on one side of him and my\npartner on the other, and handed him over to the sheriff. I was crying\ntoo when we shook hands with him and said good-bye. I told my partner\nI'd never touch a card again or drink as long as I lived, and I never\nhave, and I never will.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Donaldson looked down, and his lips were trembling. He seemed to see\nagain that scene of long ago. There was one thing I should have liked to\nask him about, but he was evidently so much moved I did not like to.\nThey seem not to have hesitated, his partner and himself, but delivered\nup this wretched boy to justice as though it were the most natural thing\nin the world. It suggested that even in those rough, wild men the\nrespect for the law had somehow the force of an instinct. A little\nshiver ran through me. Mr. Donaldson emptied his glass of Vichy and with\na curt good-night left us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The old fellow's getting a bit childish,\" said Mr. Rosenbaum. \"I don't\nbelieve he was ever very bright.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, apparently he was bright enough to make an awful lot of money.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But how? In those days in California you didn't want brains to make\nmoney, you only wanted luck. I know what I'm talking about. Johannesburg\nwas the place where you had to have your wits about you. Jo'burg in the\n'eighties. It was grand. We were a tough lot of guys, I can tell you. It\nwas each for himself and the devil take the hindmost.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe took a meditative sip of his Vichy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You talk of your cricket and baseball, your golf and tennis and\nfootball, you can have them, they're all very well for boys; is it a\nreasonable thing, I ask you, for a grown man to run about and hit a\nball? Poker's the only game fit for a grown man. Then your hand is\nagainst every man and every man's hand is against yours. Team-work? Who\never made a fortune by team-work? There's only one way to make a fortune\nand that's to down the fellow who's up against you.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I didn't know you were a poker player,\" I interrupted. \"Why don't you\ntake a hand one evening?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't play any more. I've given it up too, but for the only reason a\nman should. I can't see myself giving it up because a friend of mine was\nunlucky enough to get killed. Anyway a man who's damn fool enough to get\nkilled isn't worth having as a friend. But in the old days! If you\nwanted to know what poker was you ought to have been in South Africa\nthen. It was the biggest game I've ever seen. And they were fine\nplayers; there wasn't a crooked dodge they weren't up to. It was grand.\nJust to give you an example, one night I was playing with some of the\nbiggest men in Johannesburg and I was called away. There was a couple of\nthousand pounds in the pot! 'Deal me a hand, I won't keep you waiting,'\nI said. 'All right,' they said, 'don't hurry.' Well, I wasn't gone more\nthan a minute. When I came back I picked up my cards and saw I'd got a\nstraight flush to the queen. I didn't say a word, I just threw in my\nhand. I knew my company. And do you know, I was wrong.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What do you mean? I don't understand.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was a perfectly straight deal and the pot was won on three sevens.\nBut how could I tell that? Naturally I thought someone else had a\nstraight flush to the king. It looked to me just the sort of hand I\nmight lose a hundred thousand pounds on.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Too bad,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I very nearly had a stroke. And it was on account of another pat\nstraight flush that I gave up playing poker. I've only had about five in\nmy life.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I believe the chances are nearly sixty-six thousand to one against.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"In San Francisco it was, the year before last. I'd been playing in poor\nluck all the evening. I hadn't lost much money because I never had a\nchance to play. I'd hardly had a pair and if I got a pair I couldn't\nimprove. Then I got a hand just as bad as the others and I didn't come\nin. The man next me wasn't playing either and I showed him my hand.\n'That's the kind of thing I've been getting all the evening,' I said.\n'How can anyone be expected to play with cards like that?' 'Well, I\ndon't know what more you want,' he said, as he looked at them. 'Most of\nus would be prepared to come in on a straight flush.' 'What's that,' I\ncried. I was trembling like a leaf. I looked at the cards again. I\nthought I had two or three little hearts and two or three little\ndiamonds. It was a straight flush in hearts all right and I hadn't seen\nit. My eyes, it was. I knew what it meant. Old age. I don't cry much.\nI'm not that sort of man. But I couldn't help it then. I tried to\ncontrol myself, but the tears just rolled down my cheeks. Then I got up.\n'I'm through, gentlemen,' I said. 'When a man's eyes are so dim that he\ncan't see a straight flush when it's dealt him he has no business to\nplay poker. Nature's given me a hint and I'm taking it. I'll never play\npoker again as long as I live.' I cashed in my chips, all but one, and I\nleft the house. I've never played since.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMr. Rosenbaum took a chip out of his waistcoat pocket and showed it to\nme.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I kept this as a souvenir. I always carry it about with me. I'm a\nsentimental old fool, I know that, but, you see, poker was the only\nthing I cared for. Now I've only got one thing left.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"What is that?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA smile flickered across his cunning little face and behind his thick\nglasses his rheumy eyes twinkled with ironic glee. He looked incredibly\nastute and malicious. He gave the thin, high-pitched cackle of an old\nman amused and answered with a single word: \"Philanthropy.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\nI shook hands with the skipper and he wished me luck. Then I went down\nto the lower deck crowded with passengers, Malays, Chinese and Dyaks,\nand made my way to the ladder. Looking over the ship's side I saw that\nmy luggage was already in the boat. It was a large, clumsy-looking\ncraft, with a great square sail of bamboo matting, and it was crammed\nfull of gesticulating natives. I scrambled in and a place was made for\nme. We were about three miles from the shore and a stiff breeze was\nblowing. As we drew near I saw that the coconut trees in a green\nabundance grew to the water's edge, and among them I saw the brown roofs\nof the village. A Chinese who spoke English pointed out to me a white\nbungalow as the residence of the District Officer. Though he did not\nknow it, it was with him that I was going to stay. I had a letter of\nintroduction to him in my pocket.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI felt somewhat forlorn when I landed and my bags were set down beside\nme on the glistening beach. This was a remote spot to find myself in,\nthis little town on the north coast of Borneo, and I felt a trifle shy\nat the thought of presenting myself to a total stranger with the\nannouncement that I was going to sleep under his roof, eat his food and\ndrink his whisky, till another boat came in to take me to the port for\nwhich I was bound.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut I might have spared myself these misgivings, for the moment I\nreached the bungalow and sent in my letter he came out, a sturdy, ruddy,\njovial man, of thirty-five perhaps, and greeted me with heartiness.\nWhile he held my hand he shouted to a boy to bring drinks and to another\nto look after my luggage. He cut short my apologies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Good God, man, you have no idea how glad I am to see you. Don't think\nI'm doing anything for you in putting you up. The boot's on the other\nleg. And stay as long as you damned well like. Stay a year.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI laughed. He put away his day's work, assuring me that he had nothing\nto do that could not wait till the morrow, and threw himself into a long\nchair. We talked and drank and talked. When the heat of the day wore off\nwe went for a long tramp in the jungle and came back wet to the skin. A\nbath and a change were very grateful, and then we dined. I was tired out\nand though my host was plainly willing to go on talking straight through\nthe night I was obliged to beg him to allow me to go to bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"All right, I'll just come along to your room and see everything's all\nright.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt was a large room with verandahs on two sides of it, sparsely\nfurnished, but with a huge bed protected by mosquito netting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The bed is rather hard. Do you mind?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Not a bit. I shall sleep without rocking to-night.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy host looked at the bed reflectively.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was a Dutchman who slept in it last. Do you want to hear a funny\nstory?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI wanted chiefly to go to bed, but he was my host, and being at times\nsomewhat of a humorist myself I know that it is hard to have an amusing\nstory to tell and find no listener.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He came on the boat that brought you, on its last journey along the\ncoast, he came into my office and asked where the dak bungalow was. I\ntold him there wasn't one, but if he hadn't anywhere to go I didn't mind\nputting him up. He jumped at the invitation. I told him to have his kit\nsent along.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'This is all I've got,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He held out a little shiny black grip. It seemed a bit scanty, but it\nwas no business of mine, so I told him to go along to the bungalow and\nI'd come as soon as I was through with my work. While I was speaking the\ndoor of my office was opened and my clerk came in. The Dutchman had his\nback to the door and it may be that my clerk opened it a bit suddenly.\nAnyhow, the Dutchman gave a shout, he jumped about two feet into the air\nand whipped out a revolver.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'What the hell are you doing?' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"When he saw it was the clerk he collapsed. He leaned against the desk,\npanting, and upon my word he was shaking as though he'd got fever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I beg your pardon,' he said. 'It's my nerves. My nerves are terrible.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'It looks like it,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I was rather short with him. To tell you the truth I wished I hadn't\nasked him to stop with me. He didn't look as though he'd been drinking a\nlot and I wondered if he was some fellow the police were after. If he\nwere, I said to myself, he could hardly be such a fool as to walk right\ninto the lion's den.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'You'd better go and lie down,' I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He took himself off, and when I got back to my bungalow I found him\nsitting quite quietly, but bolt upright, on the verandah. He'd had a\nbath and shaved and put on clean things and he looked fairly\npresentable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Why are you sitting in the middle of the place like that?' I asked\nhim. 'You'll be much more comfortable in one of the long chairs.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I prefer to sit up,' he said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Queer, I thought. But if a man in this heat would rather sit up than\nlie down it's his own lookout. He wasn't much to look at, tallish and\nheavily built, with a square head and close-cropped bristly hair. I\nshould think he was about forty. The thing that chiefly struck me about\nhim was his expression. There was a look in his eyes, blue eyes they\nwere and rather small, that beat me altogether; and his face sagged as\nit were; it gave you the feeling he was going to cry. He had a way of\nlooking quickly over his left shoulder as though he thought he heard\nsomething. By God, he was nervous. But we had a couple of drinks and he\nbegan to talk. He spoke English very well; except for a slight accent\nyou'd never have known that he was a foreigner, and I'm bound to admit\nhe was a good talker. He'd been everywhere and he'd read any amount. It\nwas a treat to listen to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"We had three or four whiskies in the afternoon and a lot of gin pahits\nlater on, so that when dinner came along we were by way of being rather\nhilarious and I'd come to the conclusion that he was a damned good\nfellow. Of course we had a lot of whisky at dinner and I happened to\nhave a bottle of Benedictine, so we had some liqueurs afterwards. I\ncan't help thinking we both got very tight.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And at last he told me why he'd come. It was a rum story.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy host stopped and looked at me with his mouth slightly open as though,\nremembering it now, he was struck again with its rumness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He came from Sumatra, the Dutchman, and he'd done something to an\nAchinese and the Achinese had sworn to kill him. At first he made light\nof it, but the fellow tried two or three times and it began to be rather\na nuisance, so he thought he'd better go away for a bit. He went over to\nBatavia and made up his mind to have a good time. But when he'd been\nthere a week he saw the fellow slinking along a wall. By God, he'd\nfollowed him. It looked as though he meant business. The Dutchman began\nto think it was getting beyond a joke and he thought the best thing he\ncould do would be to skip off to Soerabaya. Well, he was strolling about\nthere one day, you know how crowded the streets are, when he happened to\nturn round and saw the Achinese walking quite quietly just behind him.\nIt gave him a turn. It would give anyone a turn.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The Dutchman went straight back to his hotel, packed his things, and\ntook the next boat to Singapore. Of course he put up at the Van Wyck,\nall the Dutch stay there, and one day when he was having a drink in the\ncourtyard in front of the hotel, the Achinese walked in as bold as\nbrass, looked at him for a minute, and walked out again. The Dutchman\ntold me he was just paralysed. The fellow could have stuck his kris into\nhim there and then and he wouldn't have been able to move a hand to\ndefend himself. The Dutchman knew he was just biding his time, that\ndamned native was going to kill him, he saw it in his eyes; and he went\nall to pieces.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But why didn't he go to the police?\" I asked.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know. I expect it wasn't a thing he wanted the police to be\nmixed up in.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what had he done to the man?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I don't know that either. He wouldn't tell me. But by the look he gave\nwhen I asked him, I expect it was something pretty rotten. I have an\nidea he knew he deserved whatever the Achinese could do.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy host lit a cigarette.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Go on,\" I said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"The skipper of the boat that runs between Singapore and Kuching lives\nat the Van Wyck between trips and the boat was starting at dawn. The\nDutchman thought it a grand chance to give the fellow the slip; he left\nhis luggage at the hotel and walked down to the ship with the skipper,\nas if he were just going to see him off, and stayed on her when she\nsailed. His nerves were all anyhow by then. He didn't care about\nanything but getting rid of the Achinese. He felt pretty safe at\nKuching. He got a room at the rest-house and bought himself a couple of\nsuits and some shirts in the Chinese shops. But he told me he couldn't\nsleep. He dreamt of that man and half a dozen times he awakened just as\nhe thought a kris was being drawn across his throat. By God, I felt\nquite sorry for him. He just shook as he talked to me and his voice was\nhoarse with terror. That was the meaning of the look I had noticed. You\nremember, I told you he had a funny look on his face and I couldn't tell\nwhat it meant. Well, it was fear.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"And one day when he was in the club at Kuching he looked out of the\nwindow and saw the Achinese sitting there. Their eyes met. The Dutchman\njust crumpled up and fainted. When he came to, his first idea was to get\nout. Well, you know, there's not a hell of a lot of traffic at Kuching\nand this boat that brought you was the only one that gave him a chance\nto get away quickly. He got on her. He was positive the man was not on\nboard.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"But what made him come here?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, the old tramp stops at a dozen places on the coast and the\nAchinese couldn't possibly guess he'd chosen this one because he only\nmade up his mind to get off when he saw there was only one boat to take\nthe passengers ashore, and there weren't more than a dozen people in it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'I'm safe here for a bit at all events,' he said, 'and if I can only be\nquiet for a while I shall get my nerve back.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"'Stay as long as you like,' I said. 'You're all right here, at all\nevents till the boat comes along next month, and if you like we'll watch\nthe people who come off.'\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"He was all over me. I could see what a relief it was to him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"It was pretty late and I suggested to him that we should turn in. I\ntook him to his room to see that it was all right. He locked the door of\nthe bath-house and bolted the shutters, though I told him there was no\nrisk, and when I left him I heard him lock the door I had just gone out\nof.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Next morning when the boy brought me my tea I asked him if he'd called\nthe Dutchman. He said he was just going to. I heard him knock and knock\nagain. Funny, I thought. The boy hammered on the door, but there was no\nanswer. I felt a little nervous, so I got up. I knocked too. We made\nenough noise to rouse the dead, but the Dutchman slept on. Then I broke\ndown the door. The mosquito curtains were neatly tucked in round the\nbed. I pulled them apart. He was lying there on his back with his eyes\nwide open. He was as dead as mutton. A kris lay across his throat, and\nsay I'm a liar if you like, but I swear to God it's true, there wasn't a\nwound about him anywhere. The room was empty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Funny, wasn't it?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Well, that all depends on your idea of humour,\" I replied.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy host looked at me quickly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"You don't mind sleeping in that bed, do you?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"N-no. But I'd just as soon you'd told me the story to-morrow morning.\"\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n",

            "content": "<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI am telling this story in the first person, though I am in no way\r\nconnected with it, because I do not want to pretend to the reader that I\r\nknow more about it than I really do. The facts are as I state them, but\r\nthe reasons for them I can only guess, and it may be that when the\r\nreader has read them he will think me wrong. No one can know for\r\ncertain. But if you are interested in human nature there are few things\r\nmore diverting than to consider the motives that have resulted in\r\ncertain actions. It was only by chance that I heard anything of the\r\nunhappy circumstances at all. I was spending two or three days on an\r\nisland on the north coast of Borneo and the District Officer had very\r\nkindly offered to put me up. I had been roughing it for some time and I\r\nwas glad enough to have a rest. The island had been at one time a place\r\nof some consequence, with a Governor of its own, but was so no longer;\r\nand now there was nothing much to be seen of its former importance\r\nexcept the imposing stone house in which the Governor had once lived and\r\nwhich now the District Officer, grumblingly because of its unnecessary\r\nsize, inhabited. But it was a comfortable house to stay in, with an\r\nimmense drawing-room, a dining-room large enough to seat forty people,\r\nand lofty, spacious bedrooms. It was shabby, because the government at\r\nSingapore very wisely spent as little money on it as possible; but I\r\nrather liked this, and the heavy official furniture gave it a sort of\r\ndull stateliness that was amusing. The garden was too large for the\r\nDistrict Officer to keep up and it was a wild tangle of tropical\r\nvegetation. His name was Arthur Low; he was a quiet, smallish man in the\r\nlater thirties, married, with two young children. The Lows had not tried\r\nto make themselves at home in this great place, but camped there, like\r\nrefugees from a stricken area, and looked forward to the time when they\r\nwould be moved to some other post where they could settle down in\r\nsurroundings more familiar to them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI took a fancy to them at once. The D.O. had an easy manner and a\r\nhumorous way with him. I am sure he performed his various duties\r\nadmirably, but he did everything he could to avoid the official\r\ndemeanour. He was slangy of speech and pleasantly caustic. It was\r\ncharming to see him play with the two children. It was quite obvious\r\nthat he had found marriage a very satisfactory state. Mrs. Low was an\r\nextremely nice little woman, plump, with dark eyes under fine eyebrows,\r\nnot very pretty, but certainly attractive. She looked healthy and she\r\nhad high spirits. They chaffed one another continually and each one\r\nseemed to look upon the other as immensely comic. Their jokes were\r\nneither very good nor very new, but they thought them so killing that\r\nyou were obliged to laugh with them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI think they were glad to see me, especially Mrs. Low, for with nothing\r\nmuch to do but keep an eye on the house and the children, she was thrown\r\nvery much on her own resources. There were so few white people on the\r\nisland that the social life was soon exhausted; and before I had been\r\nthere twenty-four hours she pressed me to stay a week, a month or a\r\nyear. On the evening of my arrival they gave a dinner-party to which the\r\nofficial population, the government surveyor, the doctor, the\r\nschoolmaster, the chief of constabulary, were invited, but on the\r\nfollowing evening the three of us dined by ourselves. At the\r\ndinner-party the guests had brought their house-boys to help, but that\r\nnight we were waited on by the Lows' one boy and my travelling servant.\r\nThey brought in the coffee and left us to ourselves. Low and I lit\r\ncheroots.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You know that I've seen you before,\" said Mrs. Low.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Where?\" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"In London. At a party. I heard someone point you out to somebody else.\r\nIn Carlton House Terrace at Lady Kastellan's.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh? When was that?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Last time we were home on leave. There were Russian dancers.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I remember. About two or three years ago. Fancy you being there!\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"That's exactly what we said to one another at the time,\" said Low, with\r\nhis slow, engaging smile. \"We'd never been at such a party in our\r\nlives.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It made a great splash, you know,\" I said. \"It was the party of the\r\nseason. Did you enjoy it?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I hated every minute of it,\" said Mrs. Low.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Don't let's overlook the fact that you insisted on going, Bee,\" said\r\nLow. \"I knew we'd be out of it among all those swells. My dress clothes\r\nwere the same I'd had at Cambridge and they'd never been much of a fit.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I bought a frock specially at Peter Robinson's. It looked lovely in the\r\nshop. I wished I hadn't wasted so much money when I got there; I never\r\nfelt so dowdy in my life.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well, it didn't much matter. We weren't introduced to anybody.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI remembered the party quite well. The magnificent rooms in Carlton\r\nHouse Terrace had been decorated with great festoons of yellow roses and\r\nat one end of the vast drawing-room a stage had been erected. Special\r\ncostumes of the Regency period had been designed for the dancers and a\r\nmodern composer had written the music for the two charming ballets they\r\ndanced. It was hard to look at it all and not allow the vulgar thought\r\nto cross one's mind that the affair must have cost an enormous amount of\r\nmoney. Lady Kastellan was a beautiful woman and a great hostess, but I\r\ndo not think anyone would have ascribed to her any vast amount of\r\nkindliness, she knew too many people to care much for any one in\r\nparticular, and I couldn't help wondering why she had asked to such a\r\ngrand party two obscure and quite unimportant little persons from a\r\ndistant colony.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Had you known Lady Kastellan long?\" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"We didn't know her at all. She sent us a card and we went because I\r\nwanted to see what she was like,\" said Mrs. Low.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"She's a very able woman,\" I said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I dare say she is. She hadn't an idea who we were when the butler man\r\nannounced us, but she remembered at once. 'Oh, yes,' she said, 'you're\r\npoor Jack's friends. Do go and find yourselves seats where you can see.\r\nYou'll adore Lifar, he's too marvellous.' And then she turned to say how\r\nd'you do to the next people. But she gave me a look. She wondered how\r\nmuch I knew and she saw at once that I knew everything.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Don't talk such nonsense, darling,\" said Low. \"How could she know all\r\nyou think she did by just looking at you, and how could you tell what\r\nshe was thinking?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It's true, I tell you. We said everything in that one look, and unless\r\nI'm very much mistaken I spoilt her party for her.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLow laughed and I smiled, for Mrs. Low spoke in a tone of triumphant\r\nvindictiveness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You are terribly indiscreet, Bee.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Is she a great friend of yours?\" Mrs. Low asked me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Hardly. I've met her here and there for fifteen years. I've been to a\r\ngood many parties at her house. She gives very good parties and she\r\nalways asks you to meet the people you want to see.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What d'you think of her?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"She's by way of being a considerable figure in London. She's amusing to\r\ntalk to and she's nice to look at. She does a lot for art and music.\r\nWhat do <i>you</i> think of her?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I think she's a bitch,\" said Mrs. Low, with cheerful but decided\r\nfrankness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"That settles her,\" I said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Tell him, Arthur.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLow hesitated for a moment.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't know that I ought to.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"If you don't, I shall.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Bee's got her knife into her all right,\" he smiled. \"It was rather a\r\nbad business really.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe made a perfect smoke-ring and watched it with absorption.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Go on, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Low.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, well. It was before we went home last time. I was D.O. in Selangor\r\nand one day they came and told me that a white man was dead in a small\r\ntown a couple of hours up the river. I didn't know there was a white man\r\nliving there. I thought I'd better go and see about it, so I got in the\r\nlaunch and went up. I made inquiries when I got there. The police didn't\r\nknow anything about him except that he'd been living there for a couple\r\nof years with a Chinese woman in the bazaar. It was rather a picturesque\r\nbazaar, tall houses on each side, with a board walk in between, built on\r\npiles on the river-bank, and there were awnings above to keep out the\r\nsun. I took a couple of policemen with me and they led me to the house.\r\nThey sold brass-ware in the shop below and the rooms above were let out.\r\nThe master of the shop took me up two flights of dark, rickety stairs,\r\nfoul with every kind of Chinese stench, and called out when we got to\r\nthe top. The door was opened by a middle-aged Chinese woman and I saw\r\nthat her face was all bloated with weeping. She didn't say anything, but\r\nmade way for us to pass. It wasn't much more than a cubby-hole under the\r\nroof; there was a small window that looked on the street, but the awning\r\nthat stretched across it dimmed the light. There wasn't any furniture\r\nexcept a deal table and a kitchen chair with a broken back. On a mat\r\nagainst the wall a dead man was lying. The first thing I did was to have\r\nthe window opened. The room was so frowsty that I retched, and the\r\nstrongest smell was the smell of opium. There was a small oil-lamp on\r\nthe table and a long needle, and of course I knew what they were there\r\nfor. The pipe had been hidden. The dead man lay on his back with nothing\r\non but a sarong and a dirty singlet. He had long brown hair, going grey,\r\nand a short beard. He was a white man all right. I examined him as best\r\nI could. I had to judge whether death was due to natural causes. There\r\nwere no signs of violence. He was nothing but skin and bone. It looked\r\nto me as though he might very likely have died of starvation. I asked\r\nthe man of the shop and the woman a number of questions. The policeman\r\ncorroborated their statements. It appeared that the man coughed a great\r\ndeal and brought up blood now and then, and his appearance suggested\r\nthat he might very well have had T.B. The Chinaman said he'd been a\r\nconfirmed opium smoker. It all seemed pretty obvious. Fortunately cases\r\nof that sort are rare, but they're not unheard-of--the white man who\r\ngoes under and gradually sinks to the last stage of degradation. It\r\nappeared that the Chinese woman had been fond of him. She'd kept him on\r\nher own miserable earnings for the last two years. I gave the necessary\r\ninstructions. Of course I wanted to know who he was. I supposed he'd\r\nbeen a clerk in some English firm or an assistant in an English store at\r\nSingapore or Kuala Lumpur. I asked the Chinese woman if he'd left any\r\neffects. Considering the destitution in which they'd lived it seemed a\r\nrather absurd question, but she went to a shabby suit-case that lay in a\r\ncorner, opened it and showed me a square parcel about the size of two\r\nnovels put together wrapped in an old newspaper. I had a look at the\r\nsuit-case. It contained nothing of any value. I took the parcel.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLow's cheroot had gone out and he leaned over to relight it from one of\r\nthe candles on the table.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I opened it. Inside was another wrapping, and on this, in a neat,\r\nwell-educated writing: To the District Officer, me as it happened, and\r\nthen the words: please deliver personally to the Viscountess Kastellan,\r\n53 Carlton House Terrace, London, S.W. That was a bit of a surprise. Of\r\ncourse I had to examine the contents. I cut the string and the first\r\nthing I found was a gold and platinum cigarette-case. As you can imagine\r\nI was mystified. From all I'd heard the pair of them, the dead man and\r\nthe Chinese woman, had scarcely enough to eat, and the cigarette-case\r\nlooked as if it had cost a packet. Besides the cigarette-case there was\r\nnothing but a bundle of letters. There were no envelopes. They were in\r\nthe same neat writing as the directions and they were signed with the\r\ninitial J. There were forty or fifty of them. I couldn't read them all\r\nthere, but a rapid glance showed me that they were a man's love letters\r\nto a woman. I sent for the Chinese woman to ask her the name of the dead\r\nman. Either she didn't know or wouldn't tell me. I gave orders that he\r\nshould be buried and got back into the launch to go home. I told Bee.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe gave her his sweet little smile.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I had to be rather firm with Arthur,\" she said. \"At first he wouldn't\r\nlet me read the letters, but of course I wasn't going to put up with any\r\nnonsense like that.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It was none of our business.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You had to find out the name if you could.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"And where exactly did you come in?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, don't be so silly,\" she laughed. \"I should have gone mad if you\r\nhadn't let me read them.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"And did you find out his name?\" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"No.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Was there no address?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Yes, there was, and a very unexpected one. Most of the letters were\r\nwritten on Foreign Office paper.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"That was funny.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I didn't quite know what to do. I had half a mind to write to the\r\nViscountess Kastellan and explain the circumstances, but I didn't know\r\nwhat trouble I might be starting; the directions were to deliver the\r\nparcel to her personally, so I wrapped everything up again and put it in\r\nthe safe. We were going home on leave in the spring and I thought the\r\nbest thing was to leave everything over till then. The letters were by\r\nway of being rather compromising.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"To put it mildly,\" giggled Mrs. Low. \"The truth is they gave the whole\r\nshow away.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't think we need go into that,\" said Low.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA slight altercation ensued; but I think on his part it was more for\r\nform's sake, since he must have known that his desire to preserve an\r\nofficial discretion stood small chance against his wife's determination\r\nto tell me everything. She had a down on Lady Kastellan and didn't care\r\nwhat she said about her. Her sympathies were with the man. Low did his\r\nbest to tone down her rash assertions. He corrected her exaggerations.\r\nHe told her that she'd let her imagination run away with her and had\r\nread into the letters more than was there. She would have done it.\r\nThey'd evidently made a deep impression on her, and from her vivid\r\naccount and Low's interruptions I gained a fairly coherent impression of\r\nthem. It was plain for one thing that they were very moving.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I can't tell you how it revolted me, the way Bee gloated over them,\"\r\nsaid Low.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"They were the most wonderful letters I've ever read. You never wrote\r\nletters like that to me.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What a damned fool you would have thought me if I had,\" he grinned.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe gave him a charming, affectionate smile.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I suppose I should, and yet, God knows I was crazy about you, and I'm\r\ndamned if I know why.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe story emerged clearly enough. The writer, the mysterious J,\r\npresumably a clerk in the Foreign Office, had fallen in love with Lady\r\nKastellan and she with him. They had become lovers and the early letters\r\nwere passionately lyrical. They were happy. They expected their love to\r\nlast for ever. He wrote to her immediately after he had left her and\r\ntold her how much he adored her and how much she meant to him. She was\r\nnever for a moment absent from his thoughts. It looked as though her\r\ninfatuation was equal to his, for in one letter he justified himself\r\nbecause she had reproached him for not coming to some place where he\r\nknew she would be. He told her what agony it had been to him that a\r\nsudden job had prevented him from being with her when he'd so eagerly\r\nlooked forward to it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen came the catastrophe. How it came or why one could only guess. Lord\r\nKastellan learnt the truth. He not merely suspected his wife's\r\ninfidelity, he had proofs of it. There was a fearful scene between them,\r\nshe left him and went to her father's. Lord Kastellan announced his\r\nintention of divorcing her. The letters changed in character. J. wrote\r\nat once asking to see Lady Kastellan, but she begged him not to come.\r\nHer father insisted that they shouldn't meet. J. was distressed at her\r\nunhappiness and dismayed by the trouble he had brought upon her, and he\r\nwas deeply sympathetic because of what she was enduring at home, for her\r\nfather and mother were furious; but at the same time it was plain that\r\nhe was relieved that the crisis had come. Nothing mattered except that\r\nthey loved one another. He said he hated Kastellan. Let him bring his\r\naction. The sooner they could get married the better. The correspondence\r\nwas one-sided, there were no letters from her, and one had to guess from\r\nhis replies what she said in them. She was obviously frightened out of\r\nher wits and nothing that he could say helped. Of course he would have\r\nto leave the Foreign Office. He assured her that this meant nothing to\r\nhim. He could get a job somewhere, in the colonies, where he would earn\r\nmuch more money. He was sure he could make her happy. Naturally there\r\nwould be a scandal, but it would be forgotten, and away from England\r\npeople would not bother. He besought her to have courage. Then it looked\r\nas though she had written somewhat peevishly. She hated being divorced,\r\nKastellan refused to take the blame on himself and be made respondent,\r\nshe did not want to leave London, it was her whole life, and bury\r\nherself in some God-forsaken place on the other side of nowhere. He\r\nanswered unhappily. He said he would do anything she wanted. He implored\r\nher not to love him less and he was tortured by the thought that this\r\ndisaster had changed her feelings for him. She reproached him for the\r\nmess they had got into; he did not try to defend himself; he was\r\nprepared to admit that he alone was to blame. Then it appeared that\r\npressure was being brought to bear on Kastellan from some high quarter\r\nand there was even yet a chance that something might be arranged.\r\nWhatever she wrote made J., the unknown J., desperate. His letter was\r\nalmost incoherent. He begged her again to see him, he implored her to\r\nhave strength, he repeated that she meant everything in the world to\r\nhim, he was frightened that she would let people influence her, he asked\r\nher to burn her boats behind her and bolt with him to Paris. He was\r\nfrantic. Then it seemed that for some days she did not write to him. He\r\ncould not understand. He did not know if she was receiving his letters.\r\nHe was in an agony. The blow fell. She must have written to say that if\r\nhe would resign from the Foreign Office and leave England her husband\r\nwas prepared to take her back. His answer was broken-hearted.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"He never saw through her for a moment,\" said Mrs. Low.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What was there to see through?\" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Don't you know what she wrote to him? I do.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Don't be such an ass, Bee. You can't possibly know.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Ass yourself. Of course I do. She put it up to him. She threw herself\r\non his mercy. She dragged in her father and mother. She brought in her\r\nchildren; I bet that was the first thought she'd given them since they\r\nwere born. She knew that he loved her so much that he was willing to do\r\neverything in the world for her, even lose her. She knew that he was\r\nprepared to accept the sacrifice of his love, his life, his career,\r\neverything for her sake, and she let him make it. She let the offer come\r\nfrom him. She let him persuade her to accept it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI listened to Mrs. Low with a smile, but with attention. She was a woman\r\nand she felt instinctively how a woman in those circumstances would act.\r\nShe thought it hateful, but she felt in her bones that in just that way\r\nwould she herself have acted. Of course it was pure invention, with\r\nnothing but J.'s letter as a foundation, but I had an impression that it\r\nwas very likely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat was the last letter in the bundle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was astonished. I had known Lady Kastellan for a good many years, but\r\nonly casually; and I knew her husband even less. He was immersed in\r\npolitics, he was Under-Secretary at the Home Office at the time of the\r\ngreat do to which the Lows and I had been invited; and I never saw him\r\nbut in his own house. Lady Kastellan had the reputation of being a\r\nbeauty; she was tall and her figure was good in a massive way. She had a\r\nlovely skin. Her blue eyes were large, set rather wide apart and her\r\nface was broad. It gave her a slightly cow-like look. She had pretty\r\npale brown hair and she held herself superbly. She was a woman of great\r\nself-possession, and it amazed me to learn that she had ever surrendered\r\nto such passion as the letters suggested. She was ambitious and there\r\nwas no doubt that she was very useful to Kastellan in his political\r\nlife. I should have thought her incapable of indiscretion. Searching my\r\nmemory I seemed to remember hearing years before that the Kastellans\r\nwere not getting on very well, but I had never heard any details, and\r\nwhenever I saw them it looked as though they were on very good terms\r\nwith one another. Kastellan was a big, red-faced fellow with sleek black\r\nhair, jovial and loud-voiced, but with little shrewd eyes that watched\r\nand noted. He was industrious, an effective speaker, but a trifle\r\npompous. He was a little too conscious of his own importance. He did not\r\nlet you forget that he had rank and wealth. He was inclined to be\r\npatronising with people of less consequence than himself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could well believe that when he discovered that his wife was having an\r\naffair with a junior clerk in the Foreign Office there was a devil of a\r\nrow. Lady Kastellan's father had been for many years permanent\r\nUnder-Secretary for Foreign Affairs and it would have been more than\r\nusually embarrassing for his daughter to be divorced on account of one\r\nof his subordinates. For all I knew Kastellan was in love with his wife\r\nand he may have been teased by a very natural jealousy. But he was a\r\nproud man, deficient in humour. He feared ridicule. The rôle of the\r\ndeceived husband is difficult to play with dignity. I do not suppose he\r\nwanted a scandal that might well jeopardise his political future. It may\r\nbe that Lady Kastellan's advisers threatened to defend the case and the\r\nprospect of washing dirty linen in public horrified him. It is likely\r\nenough that pressure was brought to bear on him and the solution to\r\nforgive and take his wife back if her lover were definitely eliminated\r\nmay have seemed the best to adopt. I have no doubt Lady Kastellan\r\npromised everything she was asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe must have had a bad fright. I didn't take such a severe view of her\r\nconduct as Mrs. Low. She was very young; she was not more than\r\nthirty-five now. Who could tell by what accident she had become J.'s\r\nmistress? I suspect that love had caught her unawares and that she was\r\nin the middle of an affair almost before she knew what she was about.\r\nShe must always have been a cold, self-possessed woman, but it is just\r\nwith people like that that nature at times plays strange tricks. I am\r\nprepared to believe that she lost her head completely. There is no means\r\nof knowing how Kastellan discovered what was going on, but the fact that\r\nshe kept her lover's letters shows that she was too much in love to be\r\nprudent. Arthur Low had mentioned that it was strange to find in the\r\ndead man's possession his letters and not hers; but that seemed to me\r\neasily explainable. At the time of the catastrophe they were doubtless\r\ngiven back to him in exchange for hers. He very naturally kept them.\r\nReading them again he could relive the love that meant everything in the\r\nworld to him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI didn't suppose that Lady Kastellan, devoured by passion, could ever\r\nhave considered what would happen if she were found out. When the blow\r\nfell it is not strange that she was scared out of her wits. She may not\r\nhave had more to do with her children than most women who live the sort\r\nof life she lived, but she may for all that not have wanted to lose\r\nthem. I did not even know whether she had ever cared for her husband,\r\nbut from what I knew of her I guessed that she was not indifferent to\r\nhis name and wealth. The future must have looked pretty grim. She was\r\nlosing everything, the grand house in Carlton House Terrace, the\r\nposition, the security; her father could give her no money and her lover\r\nhad still to find a job. It may not have been heroic that she should\r\nyield to the entreaties of her family, but it was comprehensible.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhile I was thinking all this Arthur Low went on with his story.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I didn't quite know how to set about getting in touch with Lady\r\nKastellan,\" he said. \"It was awkward not knowing the chap's name.\r\nHowever, when we got home I wrote to her. I explained who I was and said\r\nthat I'd been asked to give her some letters and a gold and platinum\r\ncigarette-case by a man who'd recently died in my district. I said I'd\r\nbeen asked to deliver them to her in person. I thought perhaps she\r\nwouldn't answer at all or else communicate with me through a solicitor.\r\nBut she answered all right. She made an appointment for me to come to\r\nCarlton House Terrace at twelve one morning. Of course it was stupid of\r\nme, but when finally I stood on the doorstep and rang the bell I was\r\nquite nervous. The door was opened by a butler. I said I had an\r\nappointment with Lady Kastellan. A footman took my hat and coat. I was\r\nled upstairs to an enormous drawing-room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'I'll tell her ladyship you're here, sir,' the butler said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"He left me and I sat on the edge of a chair and looked round. There\r\nwere huge pictures on the walls, portraits you know, I don't know who\r\nthey were by, Reynolds I should think and Romney, and there was a lot of\r\nOriental china, and gilded consoles and mirrors. It was all terribly\r\ngrand and it made me feel very shabby and insignificant. My suit smelt\r\nof camphor and it was baggy at the knees. My tie felt a bit loud. The\r\nbutler came in again and asked me to go with him. He opened another door\r\nfrom the one I'd come in by and I found myself in a further room, not so\r\nlarge as the drawing-room, but large all the same and very grand too. A\r\nlady was standing by the fireplace. She looked at me as I came in and\r\nbowed slightly. I felt frightfully awkward as I walked along the whole\r\nlength of the room and I was afraid of stumbling over the furniture. I\r\ncan only hope I didn't look such a fool as I felt. She didn't ask me to\r\nsit down.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'I understand you have some things that you wish to deliver to me\r\npersonally,' she said. 'It's very good of you to bother.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"She didn't smile. She seemed perfectly self-possessed, but I had a\r\nnotion that she was sizing me up. To tell you the truth it put my back\r\nup. I didn't much fancy being treated as if I were a chauffeur applying\r\nfor a situation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Please don't mention it,' I said, rather stiffly. 'It's all in the\r\nday's work.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Have you got the things with you?' she asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I didn't answer, but I opened the dispatch-case I'd brought with me and\r\ntook out the letters. I handed them to her. She accepted them without a\r\nword. She gave them a glance. She was very much made up, but I swear she\r\nwent white underneath. The expression of her face didn't change. I\r\nlooked at her hands. They were trembling a little. Then she seemed to\r\npull herself together.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Oh, I'm so sorry,' she said. 'Won't you sit down?'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I took a chair. For a moment she didn't seem to know quite what to do.\r\nShe held the letters in her hand. I, knowing what they were, wondered\r\nwhat she felt. She didn't give much away. There was a desk beside the\r\nchimney-piece and she opened a drawer and put them in. Then she sat down\r\nopposite me and asked me to have a cigarette. I handed her the\r\ncigarette-case. I'd had it in my breast pocket.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'I was asked to give you this too,' I said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"She took it and looked at it. For a moment she didn't speak and I\r\nwaited. I didn't quite know if I ought to get up and go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Did you know Jack well?' she asked suddenly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'I didn't know him at all,' I answered. 'I never saw him until after\r\nhis death.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'I had no idea he was dead till I got your note,' she said. 'I'd lost\r\nsight of him for a long time. Of course he was a very old friend of\r\nmine.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I wondered if she thought I hadn't read the letters or if she'd\r\nforgotten what sort of letters they were. If the sight of them had given\r\nher a shock she had quite got over it by then. She spoke almost\r\ncasually.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'What did he die of in point of fact?' she asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Tuberculosis, opium and starvation,' I answered.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'How dreadful,' she said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"But she said it quite conventionally. Whatever she felt she wasn't\r\ngoing to let me see. She was as cool as a cucumber, but I fancied,\r\nthough it may have been only my fancy, that she was watching me, with\r\nall her wits about her, and wondering how much I knew. I think she'd\r\nhave given a good deal to be certain of that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'How did you happen to get hold of these things?' she asked me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'I took possession of his effects after his death,' I explained. 'They\r\nwere done up in a parcel and I was directed to give them to you.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Was there any need to undo the parcel?'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I wish I could tell you what frigid insolence she managed to get into\r\nthe question. It made me go white and I hadn't any make-up on to hide\r\nit. I answered that I thought it my duty to find out if I could who the\r\ndead man was. I should have liked to be able to communicate with his\r\nrelations.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'I see,' she said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"She looked at me as though that were the end of the interview and she\r\nexpected me to get up and take myself off. But I didn't. I thought I'd\r\nlike to get a bit of my own back. I told her how I'd been sent for and\r\nhow I'd found him. I described the whole thing and I told her how, as\r\nfar as I knew, there'd been no one at the end to take pity on him but a\r\nChinese woman. Suddenly the door was opened and we both looked round. A\r\nbig, middle-aged man came in and stopped when he saw me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'I beg your pardon,' he said, 'I didn't know you were busy.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Come in,' she said, and when he had approached, 'This is Mr. Low. My\r\nhusband.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Lord Kastellan gave me a nod.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'I just wanted to ask you,' he began, and then he stopped.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"His eyes had caught the cigarette-case that was still resting on Lady\r\nKastellan's open hand. I don't know if she saw the look of inquiry in\r\nhis eyes. She gave him a friendly little smile. She was quite amazingly\r\nmistress of herself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Mr. Low comes from the Federated Malay States. Poor Jack Almond's dead\r\nand he's left me his cigarette-case.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Really?' said Lord Kastellan. 'When did he die?'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'About six months ago,' I said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Lady Kastellan got up.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Well, I won't keep you any longer. I dare say you're busy. Thank you\r\nso much for carrying out Jack's request.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Things are pretty bad just now in the F.M.S. if all I hear is true,'\r\nsaid Lord Kastellan.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I shook hands with them both and Lady Kastellan rang a bell.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Are you staying in London?' she asked, as I was going. 'I wonder if\r\nyou'd like to come to a little party I'm giving next week.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'I have my wife with me,' I said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Oh, how very nice. I'll send you a card.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"A couple of minutes later I found myself in the street. I was glad to\r\nbe alone. I'd had a bad shock. As soon as Lady Kastellan mentioned the\r\nname I remembered. It was Jack Almond, the wretched bum I'd found dead\r\nin the Chinese house, dead of starvation. I'd known him quite well. It\r\nnever struck me for a moment that it was he. Why, I'd dined and played\r\ncards with him, and we'd played tennis together. It was awful to think\r\nof him dying quite near me and me never knowing. He must have known he\r\nonly had to send me a message and I'd have done something. I made my way\r\ninto St. James's Park and sat down. I wanted to have a good think.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI could understand that it was a shock to Arthur Low to discover who the\r\ndead wastrel had been, for it was a shock to me too. Oddly enough I also\r\nhad known him. Not intimately, but as a man I met at parties and now and\r\nthen at a house in the country where we were both passing the week-end.\r\nExcept that it was years since I had even thought of him it would have\r\nbeen stupid of me not to put two and two together. With his name there\r\nflashed back into my memory all my recollections of him. So that was why\r\nhe had suddenly thrown up a career he liked so much! At that time, it\r\nwas just after the war, I happened to know several people in the Foreign\r\nOffice; Jack Almond was thought the cleverest of all the young men\r\nattached to it, and the highest posts the Diplomatic Service had to\r\noffer were within his reach. Of course it meant waiting. But it did seem\r\nabsurd for him to fling away his chances in order to go into business in\r\nthe Far East. His friends did all they could to dissuade him. He said he\r\nhad had losses and found it impossible to live on his salary. One would\r\nhave thought he could scrape along till things grew better. I remembered\r\nvery well what he looked like. He was tall and well-made, a trifle\r\ndressy, but he was young enough to carry off his faultless clothes with\r\na dash, with dark brown hair, very neat and sleek, blue eyes with very\r\nlong lashes, and a fresh brilliant colour. He looked the picture of\r\nhealth. He was amusing, gay and quick-witted. I never knew anyone who\r\nhad more charm. It is a dangerous quality and those who have it trade on\r\nit. Often they think it enough to get them through life without any\r\nfurther effort. It is well to be on one's guard against it. But with\r\nJack Almond it was the expression of a sweet and generous nature. He\r\ndelighted because he was delightful. He was entirely without conceit. He\r\nhad a gift for languages, he spoke French and German without a trace of\r\naccent, and his manners were admirable. You felt that when the time came\r\nhe would play the part of an ambassador to a foreign power in the grand\r\nstyle. No one could fail to like him. It was not strange that Lady\r\nKastellan should have fallen madly in love with him. My fancy ran away\r\nwith me. What is there more moving than young love? The walks together\r\nof that handsome pair in one of the parks in the warm evenings of early\r\nsummer, the dances they went to where he held her in his arms, the\r\nenchantment of the secret they shared when they exchanged glances across\r\na dinner-table, and the passionate encounters, hurried and dangerous,\r\nbut worth a thousand risks, when at some clandestine meeting-place they\r\ncould give themselves to the fulfilment of their desire. They drank the\r\nmilk of Paradise.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHow frightful that the end of it all should have been so tragic!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"How did you know him?\" I now asked Low.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"He was with Dexter and Farmilow. You know, the shipping people. He had\r\nquite a good job. He'd brought letters to the Governor and people like\r\nthat. I was in Singapore at the time. I think I met him first at the\r\nclub. He was damned good at games and all that sort of thing. Played\r\npolo. He was a fine tennis-player. You couldn't help liking him.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Did he drink, or what?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"No.\" Arthur Low was quite emphatic. \"He was one of the best. The women\r\nwere crazy about him, and you couldn't blame them. He was one of the\r\nmost decent fellows I've ever met.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI turned to Mrs. Low.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Did you know him?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Only just. When Arthur and I were married we went to Perak. He was\r\nsweet, I remember that. He had the longest eyelashes I've ever seen on a\r\nman.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"He was out quite a long time without going home. Five years, I think. I\r\ndon't want to use hackneyed phrases, but the fact is I can't say it in\r\nany other way, he'd won golden opinions. There were a certain number of\r\nfellows who'd been rather sick at his being shoved into a damned good\r\njob by influence, but they couldn't deny that he'd made good. We knew\r\nabout his having been in the F.O. and all that, but he never put on any\r\nfrills.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I think what took me,\" Mrs. Low interrupted, \"was that he was so\r\ntremendously alive. It bucked you up just to talk to him.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"He had a wonderful send-off when he sailed. I happened to have run up\r\nto Singapore for a couple of days and I went to the dinner at the Europe\r\nthe night before. We all got rather tight. It was a grand lark. There\r\nwas quite a crowd to see him off. He was only going for six months. I\r\nthink everybody looked forward to his coming back. It would have been\r\nbetter for him if he never had.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Why, what happened then?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't know exactly. I'd been moved again, and I was right away\r\nnorth.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHow exasperating! It is really much easier to invent a story out of your\r\nown head than to tell one about real people, of whom you not only must\r\nguess the motives, but whose behaviour even at crucial moments you are\r\nignorant of.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"He was a very good chap, but he was never an intimate friend of ours,\r\nyou know how cliquey Singapore is, and he moved in rather more exalted\r\ncircles than we did; when we went north I forgot about him. But one day\r\nat the club I heard a couple of fellows talking. Walton and Kenning.\r\nWalton had just come up from Singapore. There'd been a big polo match.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Did Almond play?' asked Kenning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'You bet your life he didn't,' said Walton. 'They kicked him out of the\r\nteam last season.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I interrupted.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'What <i>are</i> you talking about?' I said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Don't you know?' said Walton. 'He's gone all to pot, poor devil.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'How?' I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Drink.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'They say he dopes too,' said Kenning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Yes, I've heard that,' said Walton. 'He won't last long at that rate.\r\nOpium, isn't it?'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'If he doesn't look out he'll lose his job,' said Kenning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I couldn't make it out,\" Low went on. \"He was the last man I should\r\never have expected to go that way. He was so typically English and he\r\nwas a gentleman and all that. It appeared that Walton had travelled out\r\nwith him on the same ship when Jack came back from leave. He joined the\r\nship at Marseilles. He was rather low, but there was nothing funny about\r\nthat; a lot of people don't feel any too good when they're leaving home\r\nand have to get back to the mill. He drank a good deal. Fellows do that\r\nsometimes too. But Walton said rather a curious thing about him. He said\r\nit looked as if the life had gone out of him. You couldn't help noticing\r\nit because he'd always had such high spirits. There'd been a general\r\nsort of idea that he was engaged to some girl in England and on the ship\r\nthey jumped to the conclusion that she'd thrown him over.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"That's what I said when Arthur told me,\" said Mrs. Low. \"After all,\r\nfive years is a long time to leave a girl.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Anyhow they thought he'd get over it when he got back to work. But he\r\ndidn't, unfortunately. He went from bad to worse. A lot of people liked\r\nhim and they did all they could to persuade him to pull himself\r\ntogether. But there was nothing doing. He just told them to mind their\r\nown business. He was snappy and rude, which was funny because he'd\r\nalways been so nice to everybody. Walton said you could hardly believe\r\nit was the same man. Government House dropped him and a lot of others\r\nfollowed suit. Lady Ormonde, the Governor's wife, was a snob, she knew\r\nhe was well-connected and all that, and she wouldn't have given him the\r\ncold shoulder unless things had got pretty bad. He was a nice chap, Jack\r\nAlmond, it seemed a pity that he should make such a mess of things. I\r\nwas sorry, you know, but of course it didn't impair my appetite or\r\ndisturb my night's sleep. A few months later I happened to be in\r\nSingapore myself, and when I went to the club I asked about him. He'd\r\nlost his job all right, it appeared that he often didn't go to the\r\noffice for two or three days at a time; and I was told that someone had\r\nmade him manager of a rubber estate in Sumatra in the hope that away\r\nfrom the temptations of Singapore he might pull himself together. You\r\nsee, everyone had liked him so much, they couldn't bear the thought of\r\nhis going under without some sort of a struggle. But it was no good. The\r\nopium had got him. He didn't keep the job in Sumatra long and he was\r\nback again in Singapore. I heard afterwards that you would hardly have\r\nrecognised him. He'd always been so spruce and smart; he was shabby and\r\nunwashed and wild-eyed. A number of fellows at the club got together and\r\narranged something. They felt they had to give him one more chance and\r\nthey sent him out to Sarawak. But it wasn't any use. The fact is, I\r\nthink, he didn't want to be helped. I think he just wanted to go to hell\r\nin his own way and be as quick as he could about it. Then he\r\ndisappeared; someone said he'd gone home; anyhow he was forgotten. You\r\nknow how people drop out in the F.M.S. I suppose that's why when I found\r\na dead man in a sarong, with a beard, lying in a little smelly room in a\r\nChinese house thirty miles from anywhere, it never occurred to me for a\r\nmoment that it might be Jack Almond. I hadn't heard his name for years.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Just think what he must have gone through in that time,\" said Mrs. Low,\r\nand her eyes were bright with tears, for she had a good and tender\r\nheart.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"The whole thing's inexplicable,\" said Low.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Why?\" I asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well, if he was going to pieces, why didn't he do it when he first came\r\nout? His first five years he was all right. One of the best. If this\r\naffair of his had broken him you'd have expected him to break when it\r\nwas all fresh. All that time he was as gay as a bird. You'd have said he\r\nhadn't a care in the world. From all I heard it was a different man who\r\ncame back from leave.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Something happened during those six months in London,\" said Mrs. Low.\r\n\"That's obvious.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"We shall never know,\" sighed Low.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"But we can guess,\" I smiled. \"That's where the novelist comes in. Shall\r\nI tell you what I think happened?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Fire away.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well, I think that during those first five years he was buoyed up by\r\nthe sacrifice he'd made. He had a chivalrous soul. He had given up\r\neverything that made life worth living to him to save the woman he loved\r\nbetter than anything in the world. I think he had an exaltation of\r\nspirit that never left him. He loved her still, with all his heart; most\r\nof us fall in and out of love; some men can only love once, and I think\r\nhe was one of them. And in a strange way he was happy because he'd been\r\nable to sacrifice his happiness for the sake of someone who was worthy\r\nof the sacrifice. I think she was always in his thoughts. Then he went\r\nhome. I think he loved her as much as ever and I don't suppose he ever\r\ndoubted that her love was as strong and enduring as his. I don't know\r\nwhat he expected. He may have thought she'd see it was no good fighting\r\nher inclination any more and would run away with him. It may have been\r\nthat he'd have been satisfied to realise that she loved him still. It\r\nwas inevitable that they should meet; they lived in the same world. He\r\nsaw that she didn't care a row of pins for him any longer. He saw that\r\nthe passionate girl had become a prudent, experienced woman of the\r\nworld, he saw that she'd never loved him as he thought she loved him,\r\nand he may have suspected that she'd lured him coldly into making the\r\nsacrifice that was to save her. He saw her at parties, self-possessed\r\nand triumphant. He knew that the lovely qualities he'd ascribed to her\r\nwere of his own imagining and she was just an ordinary woman who had\r\nbeen carried away by a momentary infatuation and having got over it had\r\nreturned to her true life. A great name, wealth, social distinction,\r\nworldly success: those were the things that mattered to her. He'd\r\nsacrificed everything, his friends, his familiar surroundings, his\r\nprofession, his usefulness in the world, all that gives value to\r\nexistence--for nothing. He'd been cheated, and it broke him. Your friend\r\nWalton said the true thing, you noticed it yourself, he said it looked\r\nas if the life had gone out of him. It had. After that he didn't care\r\nany more, and perhaps the worst thing was that even with it all, though\r\nhe knew Lady Kastellan for what she was, he loved her still. I know\r\nnothing more shattering than to love with all your heart, than not to be\r\nable however hard you try to break yourself of it, someone who you know\r\nis worthless. Perhaps that is why he took to opium. To forget and to\r\nremember.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was a long speech I had made, and now I stopped.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"All that's only fancy,\" said Low.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I know it is,\" I answered, \"but it seems to fit the circumstances.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"There must have been a weak strain in him. Otherwise he could have\r\nfought and conquered.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Perhaps. Perhaps there is always a certain weakness attached to such\r\ngreat charm as he possessed. Perhaps few people love as wholeheartedly\r\nand as devotedly as he loved. Perhaps he didn't want to fight and\r\nconquer. I can't bring myself to blame him.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI didn't add, because I was afraid they would think it cynical, that\r\nmaybe if only Jack Almond hadn't had those wonderfully long eyelashes he\r\nmight now have been alive and well, minister to some foreign power and\r\non the high road to the Embassy in Paris.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Let's go into the drawing-room,\" said Mrs. Low. \"The boy wants to clear\r\nthe table.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd that was the end of Jack Almond.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>",

            "content": "<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe skipper thrust his hand into one of his trouser pockets and with\r\ndifficulty, for they were not at the sides but in front and he was a\r\nportly man, pulled out a large silver watch. He looked at it and then\r\nlooked again at the declining sun. The Kanaka at the wheel gave him a\r\nglance, but did not speak. The skipper's eyes rested on the island they\r\nwere approaching. A white line of foam marked the reef. He knew there\r\nwas an opening large enough to get his ship through, and when they came\r\na little nearer he counted on seeing it. They had nearly an hour of\r\ndaylight still before them. In the lagoon the water was deep and they\r\ncould anchor comfortably. The chief of the village which he could\r\nalready see among the coconut trees was a friend of the mate's, and it\r\nwould be pleasant to go ashore for the night. The mate came forward at\r\nthat minute and the skipper turned to him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well take a bottle of booze along with us and get some girls in to\r\ndance,\" he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't see the opening,\" said the mate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was a Kanaka, a handsome, swarthy fellow, with somewhat the look of a\r\nlater Roman emperor, inclined to stoutness; but his face was fine and\r\nclean-cut.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'm dead sure there's one right here,\" said the captain, looking\r\nthrough his glasses. \"I can't understand why I can't pick it up. Send\r\none of the boys up the mast to have a look.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe mate called one of the crew and gave him the order. The captain\r\nwatched the Kanaka climb and waited for him to speak. But the Kanaka\r\nshouted down that he could see nothing but the unbroken line of foam.\r\nThe captain spoke Samoan like a native, and he cursed him freely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Shall he stay up there?\" asked the mate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What the hell good does that do?\" answered the captain. \"The blame fool\r\ncan't see worth a cent. You bet your sweet life I'd find the opening if\r\nI was up there.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked at the slender mast with anger. It was all very well for a\r\nnative who had been used to climbing up coconut trees all his life. He\r\nwas fat and heavy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Come down,\" he shouted. \"You're no more use than a dead dog. We'll just\r\nhave to go along the reef till we find the opening.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was a seventy-ton schooner with paraffin auxiliary, and it ran, when\r\nthere was no head wind, between four and five knots an hour. It was a\r\nbedraggled object; it had been painted white a very long time ago, but\r\nit was now dirty, dingy, and mottled. It smelt strongly of paraffin and\r\nof the copra which was its usual cargo. They were within a hundred feet\r\nof the reef now and the captain told the steersman to run along it till\r\nthey came to the opening. But when they had gone a couple of miles he\r\nrealised that they had missed it. He went about and slowly worked back\r\nagain. The white foam of the reef continued without interruption and now\r\nthe sun was setting. With a curse at the stupidity of the crew the\r\nskipper resigned himself to waiting till next morning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Put her about,\" he said. \"I can't anchor here.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey went out to sea a little and presently it was quite dark. They\r\nanchored. When the sail was furled the ship began to roll a good deal.\r\nThey said in Apia that one day she would roll right over; and the owner,\r\na German-American who managed one of the largest stores, said that no\r\nmoney was big enough to induce him to go out in her. The cook, a Chinese\r\nin white trousers, very dirty and ragged, and a thin white tunic, came\r\nto say that supper was ready, and when the skipper went into the cabin\r\nhe found the engineer already seated at table. The engineer was a long,\r\nlean man with a scraggy neck. He was dressed in blue overalls and a\r\nsleeveless jersey which showed his thin arms tattooed from elbow to\r\nwrist.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Hell, having to spend the night outside,\" said the skipper.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe engineer did not answer, and they ate their supper in silence. The\r\ncabin was lit by a dim oil-lamp. When they had eaten the canned apricots\r\nwith which the meal finished the Chink brought them a cup of tea. The\r\nskipper lit a cigar and went on the upper deck. The island now was only\r\na darker mass against the night. The stars were very bright. The only\r\nsound was the ceaseless breaking of the surf. The skipper sank into a\r\ndeck-chair and smoked idly. Presently three or four members of the crew\r\ncame up and sat down. One of them had a banjo and another a concertina.\r\nThey began to play, and one of them sang. The native song sounded\r\nstrange on these instruments. Then to the singing a couple began to\r\ndance. It was a barbaric dance, savage and primeval, rapid, with quick\r\nmovements of the hands and feet and contortions of the body; it was\r\nsensual, sexual even, but sexual without passion. It was very animal,\r\ndirect, weird without mystery, natural in short, and one might almost\r\nsay childlike. At last they grew tired. They stretched themselves on the\r\ndeck and slept, and all was silent. The skipper lifted himself heavily\r\nout of his chair and clambered down the companion. He went into his\r\ncabin and got out of his clothes. He climbed into his bunk and lay\r\nthere. He panted a little in the heat of the night.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut next morning, when the dawn crept over the tranquil sea, the opening\r\nin the reef which had eluded them the night before was seen a little to\r\nthe east of where they lay. The schooner entered the lagoon. There was\r\nnot a ripple on the surface of the water. Deep down among the coral\r\nrocks you saw little coloured fish swim. When he had anchored his ship\r\nthe skipper ate his breakfast and went on deck. The sun shone from an\r\nunclouded sky, but in the early morning the air was grateful and cool.\r\nIt was Sunday, and there was a feeling of quietness, a silence as though\r\nnature were at rest, which gave him a peculiar sense of comfort. He sat,\r\nlooking at the wooded coast, and felt lazy and well at ease. Presently a\r\nslow smile moved his lips and he threw the stump of his cigar into the\r\nwater.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I guess I'll go ashore,\" he said. \"Get the boat out.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe climbed stiffly down the ladder and was rowed to a little cove. The\r\ncoconut trees came down to the water's edge, not in rows, but spaced out\r\nwith an ordered formality. They were like a ballet of spinsters, elderly\r\nbut flippant, standing in affected attitudes with the simpering graces\r\nof a bygone age. He sauntered idly through them, along a path that could\r\nbe just seen winding its tortuous way, and it led him presently to a\r\nbroad creek. There was a bridge across it, but a bridge constructed of\r\nsingle trunks of coconut trees, a dozen of them, placed end to end and\r\nsupported where they met by a forked branch driven into the bed of the\r\ncreek. You walked on a smooth, round surface, narrow and slippery, and\r\nthere was no support for the hand. To cross such a bridge required sure\r\nfeet and a stout heart. The skipper hesitated. But he saw on the other\r\nside, nestling among the trees, a white man's house; he made up his mind\r\nand, rather gingerly, began to walk. He watched his feet carefully, and\r\nwhere one trunk joined on to the next and there was a difference of\r\nlevel, he tottered a little. It was with a gasp of relief that he\r\nreached the last tree and finally set his feet on the firm ground of the\r\nother side. He had been so intent on the difficult crossing that he\r\nnever noticed anyone was watching him, and it was with surprise that he\r\nheard himself spoken to.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It takes a bit of nerve to cross these bridges when you're not used to\r\nthem.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked up and saw a man standing in front of him. He had evidently\r\ncome out of the house which he had seen.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I saw you hesitate,\" the man continued, with a smile on his lips, \"and\r\nI was watching to see you fall in.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Not on your life,\" said the captain, who had now recovered his\r\nconfidence.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I've fallen in myself before now. I remember, one evening I came back\r\nfrom shooting, and I fell in, gun and all. Now I get a boy to carry my\r\ngun for me.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was a man no longer young, with a small beard, now somewhat grey, and\r\na thin face. He was dressed in a singlet, without arms, and a pair of\r\nduck trousers. He wore neither shoes nor socks. He spoke English with a\r\nslight accent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Are you Neilson?\" asked the skipper.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I've heard about you. I thought you lived somewheres round here.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe skipper followed his host into the little bungalow and sat down\r\nheavily in the chair which the other motioned him to take. While Neilson\r\nwent out to fetch whisky and glasses he took a look round the room. It\r\nfilled him with amazement. He had never seen so many books. The shelves\r\nreached from floor to ceiling on all four walls, and they were closely\r\npacked. There was a grand piano littered with music, and a large table\r\non which books and magazines lay in disorder. The room made him feel\r\nembarrassed. He remembered that Neilson was a queer fellow. No one knew\r\nvery much about him, although he had been in the islands for so many\r\nyears, but those who knew him agreed that he was queer. He was a Swede.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You've got one big heap of books here,\" he said, when Neilson returned.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"They do no harm,\" answered Neilson with a smile.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Have you read them all?\" asked the skipper.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Most of them.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'm a bit of a reader myself. I have the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> sent\r\nme regler.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeilson poured his visitor a good stiff glass of whisky and gave him a\r\ncigar. The skipper volunteered a little information.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I got in last night, but I couldn't find the opening, so I had to\r\nanchor outside. I never been this run before, but my people had some\r\nstuff they wanted to bring over here. Gray, d'you know him?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Yes, he's got a store a little way along.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well, there was a lot of canned stuff that he wanted over, an' he's got\r\nsome copra. They thought I might just as well come over as lie idle at\r\nApia. I run between Apia and Pago-Pago mostly, but they've got smallpox\r\nthere just now, and there's nothing stirring.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe took a drink of his whisky and lit a cigar. He was a taciturn man,\r\nbut there was something in Neilson that made him nervous, and his\r\nnervousness made him talk. The Swede was looking at him with large dark\r\neyes in which there was an expression of faint amusement.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"This is a tidy little place you've got here.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I've done my best with it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You must do pretty well with your trees. They look fine. With copra at\r\nthe price it is now. I had a bit of a plantation myself once, in Upolu\r\nit was, but I had to sell it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked round the room again, where all those books gave him a feeling\r\nof something incomprehensible and hostile.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I guess you must find it a bit lonesome here though,\" he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I've got used to it. I've been here for twenty-five years.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow the captain could think of nothing more to say, and he smoked in\r\nsilence. Neilson had apparently no wish to break it. He looked at his\r\nguest with a meditative eye. He was a tall man, more than six feet high,\r\nand very stout. His face was red and blotchy, with a network of little\r\npurple veins on the cheeks, and his features were sunk into its fatness.\r\nHis eyes were bloodshot. His neck was buried in rolls of fat. But for a\r\nfringe of long curly hair, nearly white, at the back of his head, he was\r\nquite bald; and that immense, shiny surface of forehead, which might\r\nhave given him a false look of intelligence, on the contrary gave him\r\none of peculiar imbecility. He wore a blue flannel shirt, open at the\r\nneck and showing his fat chest covered with a mat of reddish hair, and a\r\nvery old pair of blue serge trousers. He sat in his chair in a heavy\r\nungainly attitude, his great belly thrust forward and his fat legs\r\nuncrossed. All elasticity had gone from his limbs. Neilson wondered idly\r\nwhat sort of man he had been in his youth. It was almost impossible to\r\nimagine that this creature of vast bulk had ever been a boy who ran\r\nabout. The skipper finished his whisky, and Neilson pushed the bottle\r\ntowards him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Help yourself.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe skipper leaned forward and with his great hand seized it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"And how come you in these parts anyways?\" he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, I came out to the islands for my health. My lungs were bad and they\r\nsaid I hadn't a year to live. You see they were wrong.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I meant, how come you to settle down right here?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I am a sentimentalist.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh!\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeilson knew that the skipper had not an idea what he meant, and he\r\nlooked at him with an ironical twinkle in his dark eyes. Perhaps just\r\nbecause the skipper was so gross and dull a man the whim seized him to\r\ntalk further.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You were too busy keeping your balance to notice, when you crossed the\r\nbridge, but this spot is generally considered rather pretty.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It's a cute little house you've got here.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Ah, that wasn't here when I first came. There was a native hut, with\r\nits beehive roof and its pillars, overshadowed by a great tree with red\r\nflowers; and the croton bushes, their leaves yellow and red and golden,\r\nmade a pied fence around it. And then all about were the coconut trees,\r\nas fanciful as women, and as vain. They stood at the water's edge and\r\nspent all day looking at their reflections. I was a young man then--good\r\nheavens, it's a quarter of a century ago--and I wanted to enjoy all the\r\nloveliness of the world in the short time allotted to me before I passed\r\ninto the darkness. I thought it was the most beautiful spot I had ever\r\nseen. The first time I saw it I had a catch at my heart, and I was\r\nafraid I was going to cry. I wasn't more than twenty-five, and though I\r\nput the best face I could on it, I didn't want to die. And somehow it\r\nseemed to me that the very beauty of this place made it easier for me to\r\naccept my fate. I felt when I came here that all my past life had fallen\r\naway, Stockholm and its University, and then Bonn: it all seemed the\r\nlife of somebody else, as though now at last I had achieved the reality\r\nwhich our doctors of philosophy--I am one myself, you know--had\r\ndiscussed so much. 'A year,' I cried to myself. 'I have a year. I will\r\nspend it here and then I am content to die.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"We are foolish and sentimental and melodramatic at twenty-five, but if\r\nwe weren't perhaps we should be less wise at fifty.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Now drink, my friend. Don't let the nonsense I talk interfere with\r\nyou.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe waved his thin hand towards the bottle, and the skipper finished what\r\nremained in his glass.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You ain't drinking nothin',\" he said, reaching for the whisky.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I am of a sober habit,\" smiled the Swede. \"I intoxicate myself in ways\r\nwhich I fancy are more subtle. But perhaps that is only vanity. Anyhow,\r\nthe effects are more lasting and the results less deleterious.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"They say there's a deal of cocaine taken in the States now,\" said the\r\ncaptain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeilson chuckled.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"But I do not see a white man often,\" he continued, \"and for once I\r\ndon't think a drop of whisky can do me any harm.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe poured himself out a little, added some soda, and took a sip.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"And presently I found out why the spot had such an unearthly\r\nloveliness. Here love had tarried for a moment like a migrant bird that\r\nhappens on a ship in mid-ocean and for a little while folds its tired\r\nwings. The fragrance of a beautiful passion hovered over it like the\r\nfragrance of hawthorn in May in the meadows of my home. It seems to me\r\nthat the places where men have loved or suffered keep about them always\r\nsome faint aroma of something that has not wholly died. It is as though\r\nthey had acquired a spiritual significance which mysteriously affects\r\nthose who pass. I wish I could make myself clear.\" He smiled a little.\r\n\"Though I cannot imagine that if I did you would understand.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe paused.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I think this place was beautiful because here for a period the ecstasy\r\nof love had invested it with beauty.\" And now he shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\"But perhaps it is only that my æsthetic sense is gratified by the happy\r\nconjunction of young love and a suitable setting.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEven a man less thick-witted than the skipper might have been forgiven\r\nif he were bewildered by Neilson's words. For he seemed faintly to laugh\r\nat what he said. It was as though he spoke from emotion which his\r\nintellect found ridiculous. He had said himself that he was a\r\nsentimentalist, and when sentimentality is joined with scepticism there\r\nis often the devil to pay.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was silent for an instant and looked at the captain with eyes in\r\nwhich there was a sudden perplexity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You know, I can't help thinking that I've seen you before somewhere or\r\nother,\" he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I couldn't say as I remember you,\" returned the skipper.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I have a curious feeling as though your face were familiar to me. It's\r\nbeen puzzling me for some time. But I can't situate my recollection in\r\nany place or at any time.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe skipper massively shrugged his heavy shoulders.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It's thirty years since I first come to the islands. A man can't figure\r\non remembering all the folk he meets in a while like that.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Swede shook his head.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You know how one sometimes has the feeling that a place one has never\r\nbeen to before is strangely familiar. That's how I seem to see you.\" He\r\ngave a whimsical smile. \"Perhaps I knew you in some past existence.\r\nPerhaps, perhaps you were the master of a galley in ancient Rome and I\r\nwas a slave at the oar. Thirty years have you been here?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Every bit of thirty years.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I wonder if you knew a man called Red?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Red?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"That is the only name I've ever known him by. I never knew him\r\npersonally. I never even set eyes on him. And yet I seem to see him more\r\nclearly than many men, my brothers, for instance, with whom I passed my\r\ndaily life for many years. He lives in my imagination with the\r\ndistinctness of a Paolo Malatesta or a Romeo. But I dare say you have\r\nnever read Dante or Shakespeare?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I can't say as I have,\" said the captain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeilson, smoking a cigar, leaned back in his chair and looked vacantly\r\nat the ring of smoke which floated in the still air. A smile played on\r\nhis lips, but his eyes were grave. Then he looked at the captain. There\r\nwas in his gross obesity something extraordinarily repellent. He had the\r\nplethoric self-satisfaction of the very fat. It was an outrage. It set\r\nNeilson's nerves on edge. But the contrast between the man before him\r\nand the man he had in mind was pleasant.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It appears that Red was the most comely thing you ever saw. I've talked\r\nto quite a number of people who knew him in those days, white men, and\r\nthey all agree that the first time you saw him his beauty just took your\r\nbreath away. They called him Red on account of his flaming hair. It had\r\na natural wave and he wore it long. It must have been of that wonderful\r\ncolour that the pre-Raphaelites raved over. I don't think he was vain of\r\nit, he was much too ingenuous for that, but no one could have blamed him\r\nif he had been. He was tall, six feet and an inch or two--in the native\r\nhouse that used to stand here was the mark of his height cut with a\r\nknife on the central trunk that supported the roof--and he was made like\r\na Greek god, broad in the shoulders and thin in the flanks; he was like\r\nApollo, with just that soft roundness which Praxiteles gave him, and\r\nthat suave, feminine grace which has in it something troubling and\r\nmysterious. His skin was dazzling white, milky, like satin; his skin was\r\nlike a woman's.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I had kind of a white skin myself when I was a kiddie,\" said the\r\nskipper, with a twinkle in his bloodshot eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut Neilson paid no attention to him. He was telling his story now and\r\ninterruption made him impatient.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"And his face was just as beautiful as his body. He had large blue eyes,\r\nvery dark, so that some say they were black, and unlike most red-haired\r\npeople he had dark eyebrows and long dark lashes. His features were\r\nperfectly regular and his mouth was like a scarlet wound. He was\r\ntwenty.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOn these words the Swede stopped with a certain sense of the dramatic.\r\nHe took a sip of whisky.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"He was unique. There never was anyone more beautiful. There was no more\r\nreason for him than for a wonderful blossom to flower on a wild plant.\r\nHe was a happy accident of nature.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"One day he landed at that cove into which you must have put this\r\nmorning. He was an American sailor, and he had deserted from a\r\nman-of-war in Apia. He had induced some good-humoured native to give him\r\na passage on a cutter that happened to be sailing from Apia to Safoto,\r\nand he had been put ashore here in a dug-out. I do not know why he\r\ndeserted. Perhaps life on a man-of-war with its restrictions irked him,\r\nperhaps he was in trouble, and perhaps it was the South Seas and these\r\nromantic islands that got into his bones. Every now and then they take a\r\nman strangely, and he finds himself like a fly in a spider's web. It may\r\nbe that there was a softness of fibre in him, and these green hills with\r\ntheir soft airs, this blue sea, took the northern strength from him as\r\nDelilah took the Nazarite's. Anyhow, he wanted to hide himself, and he\r\nthought he would be safe in this secluded nook till his ship had sailed\r\nfrom Samoa.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"There was a native hut at the cove and as he stood there, wondering\r\nwhere exactly he should turn his steps, a young girl came out and\r\ninvited him to enter. He knew scarcely two words of the native tongue\r\nand she as little English. But he understood well enough what her smiles\r\nmeant, and her pretty gestures, and he followed her. He sat down on a\r\nmat and she gave him slices of pineapple to eat. I can speak of Red only\r\nfrom hearsay, but I saw the girl three years after he first met her, and\r\nshe was scarcely nineteen then. You cannot imagine how exquisite she\r\nwas. She had the passionate grace of the hibiscus and the rich colour.\r\nShe was rather tall, slim, with the delicate features of her race, and\r\nlarge eyes like pools of still water under the palm trees; her hair,\r\nblack and curling, fell down her back, and she wore a wreath of scented\r\nflowers. Her hands were lovely. They were so small, so exquisitely\r\nformed, they gave your heartstrings a wrench. And in those days she\r\nlaughed easily. Her smile was so delightful that it made your knees\r\nshake. Her skin was like a field of ripe corn on a summer day. Good\r\nheavens, how can I describe her? She was too beautiful to be real.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"And these two young things, she was sixteen and he was twenty, fell in\r\nlove with one another at first sight. That is the real love, not the\r\nlove that comes from sympathy, common interests, or intellectual\r\ncommunity, but love pure and simple. That is the love that Adam felt for\r\nEve when he awoke and found her in the garden gazing at him with dewy\r\neyes. That is the love that draws the beasts to one another, and the\r\nGods. That is the love that makes the world a miracle. That is the love\r\nwhich gives life its pregnant meaning. You have never heard of the wise,\r\ncynical French duke who said that with two lovers there is always one\r\nwho loves and one who lets himself be loved; it is a bitter truth to\r\nwhich most of us have to resign ourselves; but now and then there are\r\ntwo who love and two who let themselves be loved. Then one might fancy\r\nthat the sun stands still as it stood when Joshua prayed to the God of\r\nIsrael.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"And even now after all these years, when I think of these two, so\r\nyoung, so fair, so simple, and of their love, I feel a pang. It tears my\r\nheart just as my heart is torn when on certain nights I watch the full\r\nmoon shining on the lagoon from an unclouded sky. There is always pain\r\nin the contemplation of perfect beauty.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"They were children. She was good and sweet and kind. I know nothing of\r\nhim, and I like to think that then at all events he was ingenuous and\r\nfrank. I like to think that his soul was as comely as his body. But I\r\ndare say he had no more soul than the creatures of the woods and forests\r\nwho made pipes from reeds and bathed in the mountain streams when the\r\nworld was young, and you might catch sight of little fawns galloping\r\nthrough the glade on the back of a bearded centaur. A soul is a\r\ntroublesome possession and when man developed it he lost the Garden of\r\nEden.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well, when Red came to the island it had recently been visited by one\r\nof those epidemics which the white man has brought to the South Seas,\r\nand one third of the inhabitants had died. It seems that the girl had\r\nlost all her near kin and she lived now in the house of distant cousins.\r\nThe household consisted of two ancient crones, bowed and wrinkled, two\r\nyounger women, and a man and a boy. For a few days he stayed there. But\r\nperhaps he felt himself too near the shore, with the possibility that he\r\nmight fall in with white men who would reveal his hiding-place; perhaps\r\nthe lovers could not bear that the company of others should rob them for\r\nan instant of the delight of being together. One morning they set out,\r\nthe pair of them, with the few things that belonged to the girl, and\r\nwalked along a grassy path under the coconuts, till they came to the\r\ncreek you see. They had to cross the bridge you crossed, and the girl\r\nlaughed gleefully because he was afraid. She held his hand till they\r\ncame to the end of the first tree, and then his courage failed him and\r\nhe had to go back. He was obliged to take off all his clothes before he\r\ncould risk it, and she carried them over for him on her head. They\r\nsettled down in the empty hut that stood there. Whether she had any\r\nrights over it (land tenure is a complicated business in the islands),\r\nor whether the owner had died during the epidemic, I do not know, but\r\nanyhow no one questioned them, and they took possession. Their furniture\r\nconsisted of a couple of grass mats on which they slept, a fragment of\r\nlooking-glass, and a bowl or two. In this pleasant land that is enough\r\nto start housekeeping on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"They say that happy people have no history, and certainly a happy love\r\nhas none. They did nothing all day long and yet the days seemed all too\r\nshort. The girl had a native name, but Red called her Sally. He picked\r\nup the easy language very quickly, and he used to lie on the mat for\r\nhours while she chattered gaily to him. He was a silent fellow, and\r\nperhaps his mind was lethargic. He smoked incessantly the cigarettes\r\nwhich she made him out of the native tobacco and pandanus leaf, and he\r\nwatched her while with deft fingers she made grass mats. Often natives\r\nwould come in and tell long stories of the old days when the island was\r\ndisturbed by tribal wars. Sometimes he would go fishing on the reef, and\r\nbring home a basket full of coloured fish. Sometimes at night he would\r\ngo out with a lantern to catch lobster. There were plantains round the\r\nhut and Sally would roast them for their frugal meal. She knew how to\r\nmake delicious messes from coconuts, and the breadfruit tree by the side\r\nof the creek gave them its fruit. On feast-days they killed a little pig\r\nand cooked it on hot stones. They bathed together in the creek; and in\r\nthe evening they went down to the lagoon and paddled about in a dug-out,\r\nwith its great outrigger. The sea was deep blue, wine-coloured at\r\nsundown, like the sea of Homeric Greece; but in the lagoon the colour\r\nhad an infinite variety, aquamarine and amethyst and emerald; and the\r\nsetting sun turned it for a short moment to liquid gold. Then there was\r\nthe colour of the coral, brown, white, pink, red, purple; and the shapes\r\nit took were marvellous. It was like a magic garden, and the hurrying\r\nfish were like butterflies. It strangely lacked reality. Among the coral\r\nwere pools with a floor of white sand and here, where the water was\r\ndazzling clear, it was very good to bathe. Then, cool and happy, they\r\nwandered back in the gloaming over the soft grass road to the creek,\r\nwalking hand in hand, and now the mynah birds filled the coconut trees\r\nwith their clamour. And then the night, with that great sky shining with\r\ngold, that seemed to stretch more widely than the skies of Europe, and\r\nthe soft airs that blew gently through the open hut, the long night\r\nagain was all too short. She was sixteen and he was barely twenty. The\r\ndawn crept in among the wooden pillars of the hut and looked at those\r\nlovely children sleeping in one another's arms. The sun hid behind the\r\ngreat tattered leaves of the plantains so that it might not disturb\r\nthem, and then, with playful malice, shot a golden ray, like the\r\noutstretched paw of a Persian cat, on their faces. They opened their\r\nsleepy eyes and they smiled to welcome another day. The weeks lengthened\r\ninto months, and a year passed. They seemed to love one another as--I\r\nhesitate to say passionately, for passion has in it always a shade of\r\nsadness, a touch of bitterness or anguish, but as wholeheartedly, as\r\nsimply and naturally as on that first day on which, meeting, they had\r\nrecognised that a god was in them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"If you had asked them I have no doubt that they would have thought it\r\nimpossible to suppose their love could ever cease. Do we not know that\r\nthe essential element of love is a belief in its own eternity? And yet\r\nperhaps in Red there was already a very little seed, unknown to himself\r\nand unsuspected by the girl, which would in time have grown to\r\nweariness. For one day one of the natives from the cove told them that\r\nsome way down the coast at the anchorage was a British whaling-ship.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"'Gee,' he said, 'I wonder if I could make a trade of some nuts and\r\nplantains for a pound or two of tobacco.'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"The pandanus cigarettes that Sally made him with untiring hands were\r\nstrong and pleasant enough to smoke, but they left him unsatisfied; and\r\nhe yearned on a sudden for real tobacco, hard, rank, and pungent. He had\r\nnot smoked a pipe for many months. His mouth watered at the thought of\r\nit. One would have thought some premonition of harm would have made\r\nSally seek to dissuade him, but love possessed her so completely that it\r\nnever occurred to her any power on earth could take him from her. They\r\nwent up into the hills together and gathered a great basket of wild\r\noranges, green, but sweet and juicy; and they picked plantains from\r\naround the hut, and coconuts from their trees, and breadfruit and\r\nmangoes; and they carried them down to the cove. They loaded the\r\nunstable canoe with them, and Red and the native boy who had brought\r\nthem the news of the ship paddled along outside the reef.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It was the last time she ever saw him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Next day the boy came back alone. He was all in tears. This is the\r\nstory he told. When after their long paddle they reached the ship and\r\nRed hailed it, a white man looked over the side and told them to come on\r\nboard. They took the fruit they had brought with them and Red piled it\r\nup on the deck. The white man and he began to talk, and they seemed to\r\ncome to some agreement. One of them went below and brought up tobacco.\r\nRed took some at once and lit a pipe. The boy imitated the zest with\r\nwhich he blew a great cloud of smoke from his mouth. Then they said\r\nsomething to him and he went into the cabin. Through the open door the\r\nboy, watching curiously, saw a bottle brought out and glasses. Red drank\r\nand smoked. They seemed to ask him something, for he shook his head and\r\nlaughed. The man, the first man who had spoken to them, laughed too, and\r\nhe filled Red's glass once more. They went on talking and drinking, and\r\npresently, growing tired of watching a sight that meant nothing to him,\r\nthe boy curled himself up on the deck and slept. He was awakened by a\r\nkick; and, jumping to his feet, he saw that the ship was slowly sailing\r\nout of the lagoon. He caught sight of Red seated at the table, with his\r\nhead resting heavily on his arms, fast asleep. He made a movement\r\ntowards him, intending to wake him, but a rough hand seized his arm, and\r\na man, with a scowl and words which he did not understand, pointed to\r\nthe side. He shouted to Red, but in a moment he was seized and flung\r\noverboard. Helpless, he swam round to his canoe, which was drifting a\r\nlittle way off, and pushed it on to the reef. He climbed in and, sobbing\r\nall the way, paddled back to shore.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What had happened was obvious enough. The whaler, by desertion or\r\nsickness, was short of hands, and the captain when Red came aboard had\r\nasked him to sign on; on his refusal he had made him drunk and kidnapped\r\nhim.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Sally was beside herself with grief. For three days she screamed and\r\ncried. The natives did what they could to comfort her, but she would not\r\nbe comforted. She would not eat. And then, exhausted, she sank into a\r\nsullen apathy. She spent long days at the cove, watching the lagoon, in\r\nthe vain hope that Red somehow or other would manage to escape. She sat\r\non the white sand, hour after hour, with the tears running down her\r\ncheeks, and at night dragged herself wearily back across the creek to\r\nthe little hut where she had been happy. The people with whom she had\r\nlived before Red came to the island wished her to return to them, but\r\nshe would not; she was convinced that Red would come back, and she\r\nwanted him to find her where he had left her. Four months later she was\r\ndelivered of a still-born child, and the old woman who had come to help\r\nher through her confinement remained with her in the hut. All joy was\r\ntaken from her life. If her anguish with time became less intolerable it\r\nwas replaced by a settled melancholy. You would not have thought that\r\namong these people, whose emotions, though so violent, are very\r\ntransient, a woman could be found capable of so enduring a passion. She\r\nnever lost the profound conviction that sooner or later Red would come\r\nback. She watched for him, and every time someone crossed this slender\r\nlittle bridge of coconut trees she looked. It might at last be he.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeilson stopped talking and gave a faint sigh.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"And what happened to her in the end?\" asked the skipper.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeilson smiled bitterly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, three years afterwards she took up with another white man.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe skipper gave a fat, cynical chuckle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"That's generally what happens to them,\" he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Swede shot him a look of hatred. He did not know why that gross,\r\nobese man excited in him so violent a repulsion. But his thoughts\r\nwandered and he found his mind filled with memories of the past. He went\r\nback five and twenty years. It was when he first came to the island,\r\nweary of Apia, with its heavy drinking, its gambling and coarse\r\nsensuality, a sick man, trying to resign himself to the loss of the\r\ncareer which had fired his imagination with ambitious thoughts. He set\r\nbehind him resolutely all his hopes of making a great name for himself\r\nand strove to content himself with the few poor months of careful life\r\nwhich was all that he could count on. He was boarding with a half-caste\r\ntrader who had a store a couple of miles along the coast at the edge of\r\na native village; and one day, wandering aimlessly along the grassy\r\npaths of the coconut groves, he had come upon the hut in which Sally\r\nlived. The beauty of the spot had filled him with a rapture so great\r\nthat it was almost painful, and then he had seen Sally. She was the\r\nloveliest creature he had ever seen, and the sadness in those dark,\r\nmagnificent eyes of hers affected him strangely. The Kanakas were a\r\nhandsome race, and beauty was not rare among them, but it was the beauty\r\nof shapely animals. It was empty. But those tragic eyes were dark with\r\nmystery, and you felt in them the bitter complexity of the groping,\r\nhuman soul. The trader told him the story and it moved him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Do you think he'll ever come back?\" asked Neilson.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"No fear. Why, it'll be a couple of years before the ship is paid off,\r\nand by then he'll have forgotten all about her. I bet he was pretty mad\r\nwhen he woke up and found he'd been shanghaied, and I shouldn't wonder\r\nbut he wanted to fight somebody. But he'd got to grin and bear it, and I\r\nguess in a month he was thinking it the best thing that had ever\r\nhappened to him that he got away from the island.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut Neilson could not get the story out of his head. Perhaps because he\r\nwas sick and weakly, the radiant health of Red appealed to his\r\nimagination. Himself an ugly man, insignificant of appearance, he prized\r\nvery highly comeliness in others. He had never been passionately in\r\nlove, and certainly he had never been passionately loved. The mutual\r\nattraction of those two young things gave him a singular delight. It had\r\nthe ineffable beauty of the Absolute. He went again to the little hut by\r\nthe creek. He had a gift for languages and an energetic mind, accustomed\r\nto work, and he had already given much time to the study of the local\r\ntongue. Old habit was strong in him and he was gathering together\r\nmaterial for a paper on the Samoan speech. The old crone who shared the\r\nhut with Sally invited him to come in and sit down. She gave him <i>kava</i>\r\nto drink and cigarettes to smoke. She was glad to have someone to chat\r\nwith and while she talked he looked at Sally. She reminded him of the\r\nPsyche in the museum at Naples. Her features had the same clear purity\r\nof line, and though she had borne a child she had still a virginal\r\naspect.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was not till he had seen her two or three times that he induced her\r\nto speak. Then it was only to ask him if he had seen in Apia a man\r\ncalled Red. Two years had passed since his disappearance, but it was\r\nplain that she still thought of him incessantly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt did not take Neilson long to discover that he was in love with her.\r\nIt was only by an effort of will now that he prevented himself from\r\ngoing every day to the creek, and when he was not with Sally his\r\nthoughts were. At first, looking upon himself as a dying man, he asked\r\nonly to look at her, and occasionally hear her speak, and his love gave\r\nhim a wonderful happiness. He exulted in its purity. He wanted nothing\r\nfrom her but the opportunity to weave around her graceful person a web\r\nof beautiful fancies. But the open air, the equable temperature, the\r\nrest, the simple fare, began to have an unexpected effect on his health.\r\nHis temperature did not soar at night to such alarming heights, he\r\ncoughed less and began to put on weight; six months passed without his\r\nhaving a hæmorrhage; and on a sudden he saw the possibility that he\r\nmight live. He had studied his disease carefully, and the hope dawned\r\nupon him that with great care he might arrest its course. It exhilarated\r\nhim to look forward once more to the future. He made plans. It was\r\nevident that any active life was out of the question, but he could live\r\non the islands, and the small income he had, insufficient elsewhere,\r\nwould be ample to keep him. He could grow coconuts; that would give him\r\nan occupation; and he would send for his books and a piano; but his\r\nquick mind saw that in all this he was merely trying to conceal from\r\nhimself the desire which obsessed him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe wanted Sally. He loved not only her beauty, but that dim soul which\r\nhe divined behind her suffering eyes. He would intoxicate her with his\r\npassion. In the end he would make her forget. And in an ecstasy of\r\nsurrender he fancied himself giving her too the happiness which he had\r\nthought never to know again, but had now so miraculously achieved.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe asked her to live with him. She refused. He had expected that and did\r\nnot let it depress him, for he was sure that sooner or later she would\r\nyield. His love was irresistible. He told the old woman of his wishes,\r\nand found somewhat to his surprise that she and the neighbours, long\r\naware of them, were strongly urging Sally to accept his offer. After\r\nall, every native was glad to keep house for a white man, and Neilson\r\naccording to the standards of the island was a rich one. The trader with\r\nwhom he boarded went to her and told her not to be a fool; such an\r\nopportunity would not come again, and after so long she could not still\r\nbelieve that Red would ever return. The girl's resistance only increased\r\nNeilson's desire, and what had been a very pure love now became an\r\nagonising passion. He was determined that nothing should stand in his\r\nway. He gave Sally no peace. At last, worn out by his persistence and\r\nthe persuasions, by turns pleading and angry, of everyone around her,\r\nshe consented. But the day after, when exultant he went to see her he\r\nfound that in the night she had burnt down the hut in which she and Red\r\nhad lived together. The old crone ran towards him full of angry abuse of\r\nSally, but he waved her aside; it did not matter; they would build a\r\nbungalow on the place where the hut had stood. A European house would\r\nreally be more convenient if he wanted to bring out a piano and a vast\r\nnumber of books.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so the little wooden house was built in which he had now lived for\r\nmany years, and Sally became his wife. But after the first few weeks of\r\nrapture, during which he was satisfied with what she gave him, he had\r\nknown little happiness. She had yielded to him, through weariness, but\r\nshe had only yielded what she set no store on. The soul which he had\r\ndimly glimpsed escaped him. He knew that she cared nothing for him. She\r\nstill loved Red, and all the time she was waiting for his return. At a\r\nsign from him, Neilson knew that, notwithstanding his love, his\r\ntenderness, his sympathy, his generosity, she would leave him without a\r\nmoment's hesitation. She would never give a thought to his distress.\r\nAnguish seized him and he battered at that impenetrable self of hers\r\nwhich sullenly resisted him. His love became bitter. He tried to melt\r\nher heart with kindness, but it remained as hard as before; he feigned\r\nindifference, but she did not notice it. Sometimes he lost his temper\r\nand abused her, and then she wept silently. Sometimes he thought she was\r\nnothing but a fraud, and that soul simply an invention of his own, and\r\nthat he could not get into the sanctuary of her heart because there was\r\nno sanctuary there. His love became a prison from which he longed to\r\nescape, but he had not the strength merely to open the door--that was\r\nall it needed--and walk out into the open air. It was torture and at\r\nlast he became numb and hopeless. In the end the fire burnt itself out\r\nand, when he saw her eyes rest for an instant on the slender bridge, it\r\nwas no longer rage that filled his heart but impatience. For many years\r\nnow they had lived together bound by the ties of habit and convenience,\r\nand it was with a smile that he looked back on his old passion. She was\r\nan old woman, for the women on the islands age quickly, and if he had no\r\nlove for her any more he had tolerance. She left him alone. He was\r\ncontented with his piano and his books.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis thoughts led him to a desire for words.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"When I look back now and reflect on that brief passionate love of Red\r\nand Sally, I think that perhaps they should thank the ruthless fate that\r\nseparated them when their love seemed still to be at its height. They\r\nsuffered, but they suffered in beauty. They were spared the real tragedy\r\nof love.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't know exactly as I get you,\" said the skipper.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"The tragedy of love is not death or separation. How long do you think\r\nit would have been before one or other of them ceased to care? Oh, it is\r\ndreadfully bitter to look at a woman whom you have loved with all your\r\nheart and soul, so that you felt you could not bear to let her out of\r\nyour sight, and realise that you would not mind if you never saw her\r\nagain. The tragedy of love is indifference.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut while he was speaking a very extraordinary thing happened. Though he\r\nhad been addressing the skipper he had not been talking to him, he had\r\nbeen putting his thoughts into words for himself, and with his eyes\r\nfixed on the man in front of him he had not seen him. But now an image\r\npresented itself to them, an image not of the man he saw, but of another\r\nman. It was as though he were looking into one of those distorting\r\nmirrors that make you extraordinarily squat or outrageously elongate,\r\nbut here exactly the opposite took place, and in the obese, ugly old man\r\nhe caught the shadowy glimpse of a stripling. He gave him now a quick,\r\nsearching scrutiny. Why had a haphazard stroll brought him just to this\r\nplace? A sudden tremor of his heart made him slightly breathless. An\r\nabsurd suspicion seized him. What had occurred to him was impossible,\r\nand yet it might be a fact.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What is your name?\" he asked abruptly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe skipper's face puckered and he gave a cunning chuckle. He looked\r\nthen malicious and horribly vulgar.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It's such a damned long time since I heard it that I almost forgot it\r\nmyself. But for thirty years now in the islands they've always called me\r\nRed.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis huge form shook as he gave a low, almost silent laugh. It was\r\nobscene. Neilson shuddered. Red was hugely amused, and from his\r\nbloodshot eyes tears ran down his cheeks.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeilson gave a gasp, for at that moment a woman came in. She was a\r\nnative, a woman of somewhat commanding presence, stout without being\r\ncorpulent, dark, for the natives grow darker with age, with very grey\r\nhair. She wore a black Mother Hubbard, and its thinness showed her heavy\r\nbreasts. The moment had come.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe made an observation to Neilson about some household matter and he\r\nanswered. He wondered if his voice sounded as unnatural to her as it did\r\nto himself. She gave the man who was sitting in the chair by the window\r\nan indifferent glance, and went out of the room. The moment had come and\r\ngone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeilson for a moment could not speak. He was strangely shaken. Then he\r\nsaid:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'd be very glad if you'd stay and have a bit of dinner with me. Pot\r\nluck.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't think I will,\" said Red. \"I must go after this fellow Gray.\r\nI'll give him his stuff and then I'll get away. I want to be back in\r\nApia to-morrow.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'll send a boy along with you to show you the way.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"That'll be fine.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRed heaved himself out of his chair, while the Swede called one of the\r\nboys who worked on the plantation. He told him where the skipper wanted\r\nto go, and the boy stepped along the bridge. Red prepared to follow him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Don't fall in,\" said Neilson.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Not on your life.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeilson watched him make his way across and when he had disappeared\r\namong the coconuts he looked still. Then he sank heavily in his chair.\r\nWas that the man who had prevented him from being happy? Was that the\r\nman whom Sally had loved all these years and for whom she had waited so\r\ndesperately? It was grotesque. A sudden fury seized him so that he had\r\nan instinct to spring up and smash everything around him. He had been\r\ncheated. They had seen each other at last and had not known it. He began\r\nto laugh, mirthlessly, and his laughter grew till it became hysterical.\r\nThe Gods had played him a cruel trick. And he was old now.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt last Sally came in to tell him dinner was ready. He sat down in front\r\nof her and tried to eat. He wondered what she would say if he told her\r\nnow that the fat old man sitting in the chair was the lover whom she\r\nremembered still with the passionate abandonment of her youth. Years\r\nago, when he hated her because she made him so unhappy, he would have\r\nbeen glad to tell her. He wanted to hurt her then as she hurt him,\r\nbecause his hatred was only love. But now he did not care. He shrugged\r\nhis shoulders listlessly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What did that man want?\" she asked presently.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe did not answer at once. She was too old, a fat old native woman. He\r\nwondered why he had ever loved her so madly. He had laid at her feet all\r\nthe treasures of his soul, and she had cared nothing for them. Waste,\r\nwhat waste! And now, when he looked at her, he felt only contempt. His\r\npatience was at last exhausted. He answered her question.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"He's the captain of a schooner. He's come from Apia.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"He brought me news from home. My eldest brother is very ill and I must\r\ngo back.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Will you be gone long?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>",

            "content": "<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCaptain Bredon was good-natured. When Angus Munro, the Curator of the\r\nmuseum at Kuala Solor, told him that he had advised Neil MacAdam, his\r\nnew assistant, on his arrival at Singapore to put up at the Van Dyke\r\nHotel, and asked him to see that the lad got into no mischief during the\r\nfew days he must spend there, he said he would do his best. Captain\r\nBredon commanded the <i>Sultan Ahmed</i>, and when he was at Singapore always\r\nstayed at the Van Dyke. He had a Japanese wife and kept a room there. It\r\nwas his home. When he got back after his fortnight's trip along the\r\ncoast of Borneo the Dutch manager told him that Neil had been there for\r\ntwo days. The boy was sitting in the little dusty garden of the hotel\r\nreading old numbers of <i>The Straits Times</i>. Captain Bredon took a look\r\nat him first and then went up.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You're MacAdam, aren't you?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil rose to his feet, flushed to the roots of his hair and answered\r\nshyly: \"I am.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"My name's Bredon. I'm skipper of the <i>Sultan Ahmed</i>. You're sailing\r\nwith me next Tuesday. Munro asked me to look after you. What about a\r\nstengah? I suppose you've learned what that means by now.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Thank you very much, but I don't drink.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe spoke with a broad Scots accent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't blame you. Drink's been the ruin of many a good man in this\r\ncountry.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe called the Chinese boy and ordered himself a double whisky and a\r\nsmall soda.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What have you been doing with yourself since you got in?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Walking about.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"There's nothing much to see in Singapore.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I've found plenty.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOf course the first thing he had done was to go to the museum. There was\r\nlittle that he had not seen at home, but the fact that those beasts and\r\nbirds, those reptiles, moths, butterflies and insects were native to the\r\ncountry excited him. There was one section devoted to that part of\r\nBorneo of which Kuala Solor was the capital, and since these were the\r\ncreatures that for the next three years would chiefly concern him, he\r\nexamined them with attention. But it was outside, in the streets, that\r\nit was most thrilling, and except that he was a grave and sober young\r\nman he would have laughed aloud with joy. Everything was new to him. He\r\nwalked till he was footsore. He stood at the corner of a busy street and\r\nwondered at the long line of rickshaws and the little men between the\r\nshafts running with dogged steps. He stood on a bridge over a canal and\r\nlooked at the sampans wedged up against one another like sardines in a\r\ntin. He peered into the Chinese shops in Victoria Road where so many\r\nstrange things were sold. Bombay merchants, fat and exuberant, stood at\r\ntheir shop doors and sought to sell him silks and tinsel jewellery. He\r\nwatched the Tamils, pensive and forlorn, who walked with a sinister\r\ngrace, and the bearded Arabs, in white skull-caps, who bore themselves\r\nwith scornful dignity. The sun shone upon the varied scene with a hard,\r\nacrid brilliance. He was confused. He thought it would take him years to\r\nfind his bearings in this multicoloured and excessive world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter dinner that night Captain Bredon asked him if he would like to go\r\nround the town.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You ought to see a bit of life while you're here,\" he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey stepped into rickshaws and drove to the Chinese quarter. The\r\nCaptain, who never drank at sea, had been making up for his abstinence\r\nduring the day. He was feeling good. The rickshaws stopped at a house in\r\na side street and they knocked at the door. It was opened and they\r\npassed through a narrow passage into a large room with benches all round\r\nit covered with red plush. A number of women were sitting about--French,\r\nItalian and American. A mechanical piano was grinding out harsh music\r\nand a few couples were dancing. Captain Bredon ordered drinks. Two or\r\nthree women, waiting for an invitation, gave them inviting glances.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well, young feller, is there anyone you fancy here?\" the Captain asked\r\nfacetiously.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"To sleep with, d'you mean? No.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"No white girls where you're going, you know.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, well.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Like to go an' see some natives?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't mind.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Captain paid for the drinks and they strolled on. They went to\r\nanother house. Here the girls were Chinese, small and dainty, with tiny\r\nfeet and hands like flowers, and they wore suits of flowered silk. But\r\ntheir painted faces were like masks. They looked at the strangers with\r\nblack derisive eyes. They were strangely inhuman.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I brought you here because I thought you ought to see the place,\" said\r\nCaptain Bredon, with the air of a man doing his bounden duty, \"but just\r\nlook-see is all. They don't like us for some reason. In some of these\r\nChinese joints they won't even let a white man in. Fact is, they say we\r\nstink. Funny, ain't it? They say we smell of corpses.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"We?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Give me Japs,\" said the Captain. \"They're fine. My wife's a Jap, you\r\nknow. You come along with me and I'll take you to a place where they\r\nhave Japanese girls, and if you don't see something you like there I'm a\r\nDutchman.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTheir rickshaws were waiting and they stepped into them. Captain Bredon\r\ngave a direction and the boys started off. They were let into the house\r\nby a stout middle-aged Japanese woman, who bowed low as they entered.\r\nShe took them into a neat, clean room furnished only with mats on the\r\nfloor; they sat down and presently a little girl came in with a tray on\r\nwhich were two bowls of pale tea. With a shy bow she handed one to each\r\nof them. The Captain spoke to the middle-aged woman and she looked at\r\nNeil and giggled. She said something to the child, who went out, and\r\npresently four girls tripped in. They were sweet in their kimonos, with\r\ntheir shining black hair artfully dressed; they were small and plump,\r\nwith round faces and laughing eyes. They bowed low as they came in and\r\nwith good manners murmured polite greetings. Their speech sounded like\r\nthe twittering of birds. Then they knelt, one on each side of the two\r\nmen, and charmingly flirted with them. Captain Bredon soon had his arms\r\nround two slim waists. They all talked nineteen to the dozen. They were\r\nvery gay. It seemed to Neil that the Captain's girls were mocking him,\r\nfor their gleaming eyes were mischievously turned towards him, and he\r\nblushed. But the other two cuddled up to him, smiling, and spoke in\r\nJapanese as though he understood every word they said. They seemed so\r\nhappy and guileless that he laughed. They were very attentive. They\r\nhanded him the bowl so that he should drink his tea, and then took it\r\nfrom him so that he should not have the trouble of holding it. They lit\r\nhis cigarette for him and one put out a small, delicate hand to take the\r\nash so that it should not fall on his clothes. They stroked his smooth\r\nface and looked with curiosity at his large young hands. They were as\r\nplayful as kittens.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well, which is it to be?\" said the Captain after a while. \"Made your\r\nchoice yet?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What d'you mean?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'll just wait and see you settled and then I'll fix myself up.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, I don't want either of them. I'm going home to bed.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Why, what's the matter? You're not scared, are you?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"No, I just don't fancy it. But don't let me stand in your way. I'll get\r\nback to the hotel all right.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, if you're not going to do anything I won't either. I only wanted to\r\nbe matey.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe spoke to the middle-aged woman and what he said caused the girls to\r\nlook at Neil with sudden surprise. She answered and the Captain shrugged\r\nhis shoulders. Then one of the girls made a remark that set them all\r\nlaughing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What does she say?\" asked Neil.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"She's pulling your leg,\" replied the Captain, smiling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut he gave Neil a curious look. The girl, having made them laugh once,\r\nnow said something directly to Neil. He could not understand, but the\r\nmockery of her eyes made him blush and frown. He did not like to be made\r\nfun of. Then she laughed outright and throwing her arm round his neck\r\nlightly kissed him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Come on, let's be going,\" said the Captain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen they dismissed their rickshaws and walked into the hotel Neil asked\r\nhim:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What was it that girl said that made them all laugh?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"She said you were a virgin.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't see anything to laugh at in that,\" said Neil, with his slow\r\nScots accent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Is it true?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I suppose it is.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"How old are you?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Twenty-two.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What are you waiting for?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Till I marry.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Captain was silent. At the top of the stairs he held out his hand.\r\nThere was a twinkle in his eyes when he bade the lad good-night, but\r\nNeil met it with a level, candid and untroubled gaze.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThree days later they sailed. Neil was the only white passenger. When\r\nthe Captain was busy he read. He was reading again Wallace's <i>Malay\r\nArchipelago</i>. He had read it as a boy, but now it had a new and\r\nabsorbing interest for him. When the Captain was at leisure they played\r\ncribbage or sat in long chairs on the deck, smoking, and talked. Neil\r\nwas the son of a country doctor, and he could not remember when he had\r\nnot been interested in natural history. When he had done with school he\r\nwent to the University of Edinburgh and there took a B.Sc. with Honours.\r\nHe was looking out for a job as demonstrator in biology when he chanced\r\nto see in <i>Nature</i> an advertisement for an assistant curator of the\r\nmuseum at Kuala Solor. The Curator, Angus Munro, had been at Edinburgh\r\nwith his uncle, a Glasgow merchant, and his uncle wrote to ask him if he\r\nwould give the boy a trial. Though Neil was especially interested in\r\nentomology he was a trained taxidermist, which the advertisement said\r\nwas essential; he enclosed certificates from Neil's old teachers; he\r\nadded that Neil had played football for his university. In a few weeks a\r\ncable arrived engaging him and a fortnight later he sailed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What's Mr. Munro like?\" asked Neil.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Good fellow. Everybody likes him.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I looked out his papers in the scientific journals. He had one in the\r\nlast number of <i>The Ibis</i> on the Gymnathidæ.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't know anything about that. I know he's got a Russian wife. They\r\ndon't like her much.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I got a letter from him at Singapore saying they'd put me up for a bit\r\ntill I could look round and see what I wanted to do.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow they were steaming up the river. At the mouth was a straggling\r\nfishermen's village standing on piles in the water; on the bank grew\r\nthickly nipah palm and the tortured mangrove; beyond stretched the dense\r\ngreen of the virgin forest. In the distance, darkly silhouetted against\r\nthe blue sky, was the rugged outline of a mountain. Neil, his heart\r\nbeating with the excitement that possessed him, devoured the scene with\r\neager eyes. He was surprised. He knew his Conrad almost by heart and he\r\nwas expecting a land of brooding mystery. He was not prepared for the\r\nblue milky sky. Little white clouds on the horizon, like sailing boats\r\nbecalmed, shone in the sun. The green trees of the forest glittered in\r\nthe brilliant light. Here and there, on the banks, were Malay houses\r\nwith thatched roofs, and they nestled cosily among fruit trees. Natives\r\nin dug-outs rowed, standing, up the river. Neil had no feeling of being\r\nshut in, nor, in that radiant morning, of gloom, but of space and\r\nfreedom. The country offered him a gracious welcome. He knew he was\r\ngoing to be happy in it. Captain Bredon from the bridge threw a friendly\r\nglance at the lad standing below him. He had taken quite a fancy to him\r\nduring the four days the journey had lasted. It was true he did not\r\ndrink, and when you made a joke he was as likely as not to take you\r\nseriously, but there was something very taking in his seriousness;\r\neverything was interesting and important to him--that, of course, was\r\nwhy he did not find your jokes amusing; but even though he didn't see\r\nthem he laughed, because he felt you expected it. He laughed because\r\nlife was grand. He was grateful for every little thing you told him. He\r\nwas very polite. He never asked you to pass him anything without saying\r\n\"please\" and always said \"thank you\" when you gave it. And he was a\r\ngood-looking fellow, no one could deny that. Neil was standing with his\r\nhands on the rail, bare-headed, looking at the passing bank. He was\r\ntall, six foot two, with long, loose limbs, broad shoulders and narrow\r\nhips; there was something charmingly coltish about him, so that you\r\nexpected him at any moment to break into a caper. He had brown curly\r\nhair with a peculiar shine in it; sometimes when the light caught it, it\r\nglittered like gold. His eyes, large and very blue, shone with\r\ngood-humour. They reflected his happy disposition. His nose was short\r\nand blunt and his mouth big, his chin determined; his face was rather\r\nbroad. But his most striking feature was his skin; it was very white and\r\nsmooth, with a lovely patch of red on either cheek. It would have been a\r\nbeautiful skin even for a woman. Captain Bredon made the same joke to\r\nhim every morning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well, my lad, have you shaved to-day?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil passed his hand over his chin.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"No, d'you think I need it?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Captain always laughed at this.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Need it? Why, you've got a face like a baby's bottom.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd invariably Neil reddened to the roots of his hair.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I shave once a week,\" he retorted.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut it wasn't only his looks that made you like him. It was his\r\ningenuousness, his candour and the freshness with which he confronted\r\nthe world. For all his intentness and the solemn way in which he took\r\neverything, and his inclination to argue upon every point that came up,\r\nthere was something strangely simple in him that gave you quite an odd\r\nfeeling. The Captain couldn't make it out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I wonder if it's because he's never had a woman,\" he said to himself.\r\n\"Funny. I should have thought the girls never left him alone. With a\r\ncomplexion like that.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut the <i>Sultan Ahmed</i> was nearing the bend after rounding which Kuala\r\nSolor would be in sight and the Captain's reflections were interrupted\r\nby the necessities of his work. He rang down to the engine room. The\r\nship slackened to half speed. Kuala Solor straggled along the left bank\r\nof the river, a white neat and trim little town, and on the right on a\r\nhill were the fort and the Sultan's palace. There was a breeze and the\r\nSultan's flag, at the top of a tall staff, waved bravely against the\r\nsky. They anchored in midstream. The doctor and a police officer came on\r\nboard in the government launch. They were accompanied by a tall thin man\r\nin white ducks. The Captain stood at the head of the gangway and shook\r\nhands with them. Then he turned to the last comer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well, I've brought you your young hopeful safe and sound.\" And with a\r\nglance at Neil: \"This is Munro.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe tall thin man held out his hand and gave Neil an appraising look.\r\nNeil flushed a little and smiled. He had beautiful teeth.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"How do you do, sir?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMunro did not smile with his lips, but faintly with his grey eyes. His\r\ncheeks were hollow and he had a thin aquiline nose and pale lips. He was\r\ndeeply sunburned. His face looked tired, but his expression was very\r\ngentle, and Neil immediately felt confidence in him. The Captain\r\nintroduced him to the doctor and the policeman and suggested that they\r\nshould have a drink. When they sat down and the boy brought bottles of\r\nbeer Munro took off his topee. Neil saw that he had close-cropped brown\r\nhair turning grey. He was a man of forty, quiet, self-possessed in\r\nmanner, with an intellectual air that distinguished him from the brisk\r\nlittle doctor and the heavy swaggering police officer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"MacAdam doesn't drink,\" said the Captain when the boy poured out four\r\nglasses of beer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"All the better,\" said Munro. \"I hope you haven't been trying to lure\r\nhim into evil ways.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I tried to in Singapore,\" returned the Captain, with a twinkle in his\r\neyes, \"but there was nothing doing.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he had finished his beer Munro turned to Neil.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well, we'll be getting ashore, shall we?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil's baggage was put in charge of Munro's boy and the two men got into\r\na sampan. They landed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Do you want to go straight up to the bungalow or would you like to have\r\na look round first? We've got a couple of hours before tiffin.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Couldn't we go to the museum?\" said Neil.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMunro's eyes smiled gently. He was pleased. Neil was shy and Munro not\r\nby nature talkative, so they walked in silence. By the river were the\r\nnative huts and here, living their immemorial lives, dwelt the Malays.\r\nThey were busy, but without haste, and you were conscious of a happy,\r\nnormal activity. There was a sense of the rhythm of life of which the\r\npattern was birth and death, love and the affairs common to mankind.\r\nThey came to the bazaars, narrow streets with arcades, where the teeming\r\nChinese, working and eating, noisily talking, as is their way,\r\nindefatigably strove with eternity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It's not much after Singapore,\" said Munro, \"but I always think it's\r\nrather picturesque.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe spoke with an accent less broad than Neil's, but the Scots burr was\r\nthere and it put Neil at his ease. He could never quite get it out of\r\nhis head that the English of English people was affected.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe museum was a handsome stone building and as they entered its portals\r\nMunro instinctively straightened himself. The attendant at the door\r\nsaluted and Munro spoke to him in Malay, evidently explaining who Neil\r\nwas, for the attendant gave him a smile and saluted again. It was cool\r\nin there in comparison with the heat without and the light was pleasant\r\nafter the glare of the street.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'm afraid you'll be disappointed,\" said Munro. \"We haven't got half\r\nthe things we ought to have, but up to now we've been handicapped by\r\nlack of money. We've had to do the best we could. So you must make\r\nallowances.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil stepped in like a swimmer diving confidently into a summer sea. The\r\nspecimens were admirably arranged. Munro had sought to please as well as\r\nto instruct, and birds and beasts and reptiles were presented, as far as\r\npossible in their natural surroundings, in such a way as to give a vivid\r\nimpression of life. Neil lost his shyness and began with boyish\r\nenthusiasm to talk of this and that. He asked an infinity of questions.\r\nHe was excited. Neither of them was conscious of the passage of time,\r\nand when Munro glanced at his watch he was surprised to see what the\r\nhour was. They got into rickshaws and drove to the bungalow.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMunro led the young man into a drawing-room. A woman was lying on a sofa\r\nreading a book and as they came in she slowly rose.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"This is my wife. I'm afraid we're dreadfully late, Darya.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What does it matter?\" she smiled. \"What is more unimportant than time?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe held out her hand, a rather large hand, to Neil and gave a long,\r\nreflective, but friendly look.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I suppose you've been showing him the museum.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe was a woman of five-and-thirty, of medium height, with a pale brown\r\nface of a uniform colour and pale blue eyes. Her hair, parted in the\r\nmiddle and wound into a knot on the nape of her neck, was untidy; it had\r\na moth-like quality and was of a curious pale brown. Her face was broad,\r\nwith high cheek-bones, and she had a rather fleshy nose. She was not a\r\npretty woman, but there was in her slow movements a sensual grace and in\r\nher manner as it were a physical casualness that only very dull people\r\ncould have failed to find interesting. She wore a frock of green cotton.\r\nShe spoke English perfectly, but with a slight accent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey sat down to tiffin. Neil was overcome once more with shyness, but\r\nDarya did not seem to notice it. She talked freely and easily. She asked\r\nhim about his journey and what he had thought of Singapore. She told him\r\nabout the people he would have to meet. That afternoon Munro was to take\r\nhim to call on the Resident, the Sultan being away, and later they would\r\ngo to the club. There he would see everybody.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You will be popular,\" she said, her pale blue eyes resting on him with\r\nattention. A man less ingenuous than Neil might have noticed that she\r\ntook stock of his size and youthful virility, his shiny, curling hair\r\nand his lovely skin. \"They don't think much of us.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, nonsense, Darya. You're too sensitive. They're English, that's\r\nall.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"They think it's rather funny of Angus to be a scientist and they think\r\nit's rather vulgar of me to be a Russian. I don't care. They're fools.\r\nThey're the most commonplace, the most narrow-minded, the most\r\nconventional people it has ever been my misfortune to live amongst.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Don't put MacAdam off the moment he arrives. He'll find them kind and\r\nhospitable.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What is your first name?\" she asked the boy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Neil.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I shall call you by it. And you must call me Darya. I hate being called\r\nMrs. Munro. It makes me feel like a minister's wife.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil blushed. He was embarrassed that she should ask him so soon to be\r\nso familiar. She went on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Some of the men are not bad.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"They do their job competently and that's what they're here for,\" said\r\nMunro.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"They shoot. They play football and tennis and cricket. I get on with\r\nthem quite well. The women are intolerable. They are jealous and\r\nspiteful and lazy. They can talk of nothing. If you introduce an\r\nintellectual subject they look down their noses as though you were\r\nindecent. What can they talk about? They're interested in nothing. If\r\nyou speak of the body they think you improper, and if you speak of the\r\nsoul they think you priggish.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You mustn't take what my wife says too literally,\" smiled Munro, in his\r\ngentle, tolerant way. \"The community here is just like any other in the\r\nEast, neither very clever, nor very stupid, but amiable and kindly. And\r\nthat's a good deal.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't want people to be amiable and kindly. I want them to be vital\r\nand passionate. I want them to be interested in mankind. I want them to\r\nattach more importance to the things of the spirit than to a gin pahit\r\nor a curry tiffin. I want art to matter to them and literature.\" She\r\naddressed herself abruptly to Neil: \"Have you got a soul?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know. I don't know exactly what you mean.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Why do you blush when I ask you? Why should you be ashamed of your\r\nsoul? It is what is important in you. Tell me about it. I am interested\r\nin you and I want to know.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt seemed very awkward to Neil to be tackled in this way by a perfect\r\nstranger. He had never met anyone like this. But he was a serious young\r\nman and when he was asked a question straight out he did his best to\r\nanswer it. It was Munro's presence that embarrassed him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't know what you mean by the soul. If you mean an immaterial or\r\nspiritual entity, separately produced by the creator, in temporary\r\nconjunction with the material body, then my answer is in the negative.\r\nIt seems to me that such a radically dualistic view of human personality\r\ncannot be defended by anyone who is able to take a calm view of the\r\nevidence. If, on the other hand, you mean by soul the aggregate of\r\npsychic elements which form what we know as the personality of the\r\nindividual, then, of course, I have.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You're very sweet and you're wonderfully handsome,\" she said, smiling.\r\n\"No, I mean the heart with its longings and the body with its desires\r\nand the infinite in us. Tell me, what did you read on the journey, or\r\ndid you only play deck tennis?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil was taken aback at the inconsequence of her reply. He would have\r\nbeen a little affronted except for the good-humour in her eyes and the\r\nnaturalness in her manner. Munro smiled quietly at the young man's\r\nbewilderment. When he smiled the lines that ran from the wings of his\r\nnostrils to the corners of his mouth became deep furrows.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I read a lot of Conrad.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"For pleasure or to improve your mind?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Both. I admire him awfully.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDarya threw up her arms in an extravagant gesture of protest.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"That Pole,\" she cried. \"How can you English ever have let yourselves be\r\ntaken in by that wordy mountebank? He has all the superficiality of his\r\ncountrymen. That stream of words, those involved sentences, the showy\r\nrhetoric, that affectation of profundity: when you get through all that\r\nto the thought at the bottom, what do you find but a trivial\r\ncommonplace? He was like a second-rate actor who puts on a romantic\r\ndress and declaims a play by Victor Hugo. For five minutes you say this\r\nis heroic, and then your whole soul revolts and you cry, no, this is\r\nfalse, false, false.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe spoke with a passion that Neil had never known anyone show when\r\nspeaking of art or literature. Her cheeks, usually colourless, flushed\r\nand her pale eyes glowed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"There's no one who got atmosphere like Conrad,\" said Neil. \"I can smell\r\nand see and feel the East when I read him.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Nonsense. What do you know about the East? Everyone will tell you that\r\nhe made the grossest blunders. Ask Angus.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Of course he was not always accurate,\" said Munro, in his measured,\r\nreflective way. \"The Borneo he described is not the Borneo we know. He\r\nsaw it from the deck of a merchant-vessel and he was not an acute\r\nobserver even of what he saw. But does it matter? I don't know why\r\nfiction should be hampered by fact. I don't think it's a mean\r\nachievement to have created a country, a dark, sinister, romantic and\r\nheroic country of the soul.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You're a sentimentalist, my poor Angus.\" And then again to Neil: \"You\r\nmust read Turgeniev, you must read Tolstoi, you must read Dostoevsky.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil did not in the least know what to make of Darya Munro. She skipped\r\nover the first stages of acquaintance and treated him at once like\r\nsomeone she had known intimately all her life. It puzzled him. It seemed\r\nso reckless. When he met anyone his own instinct was to go cautiously.\r\nHe was amiable, but he did not like to step too far before he saw his\r\nway before him. He did not want to give anyone his confidence before he\r\nthought himself justified. But with Darya you could not help yourself;\r\nshe forced your confidence. She poured out the feelings and thoughts\r\nthat most people keep to themselves like a prodigal flinging gold pieces\r\nto a scrambling crowd. She did not talk, she did not act, like anyone he\r\nhad ever known. She did not mind what she said. She would speak of the\r\nnatural functions of the human animal in a way that brought the blushes\r\ncoursing to his cheeks. They excited her ridicule.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, what a prig you are! What is there indecent in it? When I'm going\r\nto take a purge, why shouldn't I say so and when I think you want one,\r\nwhy shouldn't I tell you?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Theoretically I dare say you're right,\" said Neil, always judicious and\r\nreasonable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe made him tell her of his father and mother, his brothers, his life\r\nat school and at the university. She told him about herself. Her father\r\nwas a general killed in the war and her mother a Princess Lutchkov. They\r\nwere in Eastern Russia when the Bolsheviks seized power, and fled to\r\nYokohama. Here they had subsisted miserably on the sale of their jewels\r\nand such objects of art as they had been able to save, and here she\r\nmarried a fellow-exile. She was unhappy with him and in two years\r\ndivorced him. Her mother died and, penniless, she was driven to earn her\r\nliving as best she could. She was employed by an American relief\r\norganisation. She taught in a mission school. She worked in a hospital.\r\nShe made Neil's blood boil, and at the same time embarrassed him very\r\nmuch, when she spoke of the men who tried to take advantage of her\r\ndefencelessness and her poverty. She spared him no details.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Brutes,\" he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, all men are like that,\" she replied, with a shrug of her shoulders.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe told him how once she protected her virtue at the point of her\r\nrevolver.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I swore I'd kill him if he took another step, and if he had I'd have\r\nshot him like a dog.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Gosh!\" said Neil.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was at Yokohama that she met Angus. He was spending his leave in\r\nJapan. She was captivated by his straightforwardness, the decency which\r\nwas so obvious in him, his tenderness and his consideration. He was not\r\na business man; he was a scientist, and science is milk-brother to art.\r\nHe offered her peace. He offered her security. And she was tired of\r\nJapan. Borneo was a land of mystery. They had been married for five\r\nyears.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe gave Neil the Russian novelists to read. She gave him <i>Fathers and\r\nSons</i>, <i>Anna Karenina</i> and <i>The Brothers Karamazoff</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Those are the three peaks of our literature. Read them. They are the\r\ngreatest novels the world has ever seen.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLike many of her countrymen she talked as though no other literature\r\ncounted, and as though a few novels and stories, some indifferent poetry\r\nand half a dozen good plays had made whatever else the world has\r\nproduced negligible. Neil was fascinated and overwhelmed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You're rather like Alyosha yourself, Neil,\" she said, looking at him\r\nwith eyes that were now so soft and tender, \"an Alyosha with a Scotch\r\ndourness, suspicious and prudent, that will not let the soul in you, the\r\nspiritual beauty, come out.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'm not a bit like Alyosha,\" he answered self-consciously.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You don't know what you're like. You don't know anything about\r\nyourself. Why are you a naturalist? Is it for money? You could have made\r\nmuch more money by going into your uncle's office in Glasgow. I feel in\r\nyou something strange and unearthly. I could bow down at your feet as\r\nFather Zossima did to Dimitri.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Please don't,\" he said, smiling, but flushing a little too.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut the novels he read made her seem a little less strange to him. They\r\ngave her an environment and he recognised in her traits which, however\r\nunusual in the women he knew in Scotland, his mother and the daughters\r\nof his uncle in Glasgow, were common to many of the characters in\r\nRussian fiction. He no longer wondered that she should like to sit up so\r\nlate, drinking innumerable cups of tea, and lie on the sofa nearly all\r\nday long reading and incessantly smoking cigarettes. She could do\r\nnothing at all for days on end without being bored. She had a curious\r\nmixture of languor and zest. She often said, with a shrug of her\r\nshoulders, that she was an Oriental, and a European only by chance. She\r\nhad a feline grace that indeed suggested the Oriental. She was immensely\r\nuntidy and it did not seem to affect her that cigarette-ends, old papers\r\nand empty tins should lie about their living-room. But he thought she\r\nhad something of Anna Karenina in her, and he transferred to her the\r\nsympathy he felt for that pathetic creature. He understood her\r\narrogance. It was not unnatural that she despised the women of the\r\ncommunity, whose acquaintance little by little he made; they <i>were</i>\r\ncommonplace; her mind was quicker than theirs, she had a wider culture,\r\nand she had above all a sort of tremulous sensitiveness that made <i>them</i>\r\nextraordinarily colourless. She certainly took no pains to conciliate\r\nthem. Though at home she slopped about in a sarong and baju, when she\r\nand Angus went out to dinner she dressed with a splendour that was\r\nsomewhat out of place. She liked to display her ample bosom and her\r\nshapely back. She painted her cheeks and made up her eyes like an\r\nactress for the footlights. Though it made Neil angry to see the amused\r\nor outraged glances that her appearance provoked, he could not in his\r\nheart but think it a pity that she should make such an object of\r\nherself. She looked grand, of course, but if you hadn't known who she\r\nwas you would have thought she wasn't respectable. There were things\r\nabout her that he could never get over. She had an enormous appetite and\r\nit fashed him that she ate more than he and Angus together. He could\r\nnever quite get used to the bluntness with which she discussed sexual\r\nmatters. She took it for granted that at home and in Edinburgh he had\r\nhad affairs with a host of women. She pressed him for details of his\r\nadventures. His Scotch pawkiness helped him to parry her thrusts and he\r\nevaded her questions with native caution. She laughed at his reticence.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSometimes she shocked him. He grew accustomed to the frankness with\r\nwhich she admired his looks, and when she told him that he was as\r\nbeautiful as a young Norse god he did not turn a hair. Flattery fell off\r\nhim like water from a duck's back. But he did not like it when she ran\r\nher hand, though large, very soft, with caressing fingers, through his\r\ncurly hair or, a smile on her lips, stroked his smoothed face. He\r\ncouldn't bear being mussed about. One day she wanted a drink of tonic\r\nwater and began pouring some out in a glass that stood on the table.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"That's my glass,\" he said quickly. \"I've just been drinking out of it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well, what of it? You haven't got syphilis, have you?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I hate drinking out of other people's glasses myself.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe was funny about cigarettes too. Once, when he hadn't been there very\r\nlong, he had just lit one, when she passed and said:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I want that.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe took it out of his mouth and began to smoke it. After two or three\r\npuffs, she said she did not want any more and handed it back to him. The\r\nend she had had in her mouth was red from the rouge on her lips, and he\r\ndidn't want to go on smoking it at all. But he was afraid she would\r\nthink it rude if he threw it away. It somewhat disgusted him. Often she\r\nwould ask him for a cigarette and when he handed it to her, say:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, light it for me, will you?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he did so, and held it out to her, she opened her mouth so that he\r\nshould put it in. He hadn't been able to help wetting the end a little.\r\nHe wondered she could bear to put it in her mouth after it had been in\r\nhis. The whole thing seemed to him awfully familiar. He was sure Munro\r\nwouldn't like it. She had even done this once or twice at the club. Neil\r\nhad felt himself go purple. He wished she hadn't got these rather\r\nunpleasant habits, but he supposed they were Russian, and one couldn't\r\ndeny that she was wonderfully good company. Her conversation was very\r\nstimulating. It was like champagne (which Neil had tasted once and\r\nthought wretched stuff), \"metaphorically speaking\". There was nothing\r\nshe couldn't talk about. She didn't talk like a man; with a man you\r\ngenerally knew what he would say next, but with her you never did; her\r\nintuition was quite remarkable. She gave you ideas. She enlarged your\r\nmind and excited your imagination. Neil felt alive as he had never felt\r\nalive before. He seemed to walk on mountain peaks and the horizons of\r\nthe spirit were unbounded. Neil felt a certain complacency when he\r\nstopped to reflect on what an exalted plane his mind communed with hers.\r\nSuch conversations made very small beer of the vaunted pleasure of\r\nsense. She was in many ways (he was of a cautious nature and seldom made\r\na statement even to himself that he did not qualify) the most\r\nintelligent woman he had ever met. And besides, she was Angus Munro's\r\nwife.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor, whatever Neil's reservations were about Darya, he had none about\r\nMunro, and she would have had to be a much less remarkable woman not to\r\nprofit by the enormous admiration he conceived for her husband. With him\r\nNeil let himself go. He felt for him what he had never felt for anyone\r\nbefore. He was so sane, so balanced, so tolerant. This was the sort of\r\nman he would himself like to be when he was older. He talked little, but\r\nwhen he did, with good sense. He was wise. He had a dry humour that Neil\r\nunderstood. It made the hearty English fun of the men at the club seem\r\ninane. He was kind and patient. He had a dignity that made it impossible\r\nto conceive of anyone taking a liberty with him, but he was neither\r\npompous nor solemn. He was honest and absolutely truthful. But Neil\r\nadmired him no less as a scientist than as a man. He had imagination. He\r\nwas careful and painstaking. Though his interest was in research he did\r\nthe routine work of the museum conscientiously. He was just then much\r\ninterested in stick-insects and intended to write a paper on their\r\npowers of parthenogenetic reproduction. An incident occurred in\r\nconnection with the experiments he was making that made a great\r\nimpression on Neil. One day, a little captive gibbon escaped from its\r\nchain and ate up all the larvae and so destroyed the whole of Munro's\r\nevidence. Neil nearly cried. Angus Munro took the gibbon in his arms\r\nand, smiling, stroked it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Diamond, Diamond,\" he said, quoting Sir Isaac Newton, \"you little know\r\nthe damage you have done.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was also studying mimicry and instilled into Neil his absorbed\r\ninterest in this controversial subject. They had interminable talks\r\nabout it. Neil was astonished at the Curator's wonderful knowledge. It\r\nwas encylopædic, and he was abashed at his own ignorance. But it was\r\nwhen Munro spoke of the trips into the country to collect specimens that\r\nhis enthusiasm was most contagious. That was the perfect life, a life of\r\nhardship, difficulty, often of privation and sometimes of danger, but\r\nrewarded by the thrill of finding a rare, or even a new, species, by the\r\nbeauty of the scenery and the intimate observation of nature, and above\r\nall by the sense of freedom from every tie. It was for this part of the\r\nwork that Neil had been chiefly engaged. Munro was occupied in research\r\nwork that made it difficult for him to be away from home for several\r\nweeks at a time, and Darya had always refused to accompany him. She had\r\nan unreasoning fear of the jungle. She was terrified of wild beasts,\r\nsnakes and venomous insects. Though Munro had told her over and over\r\nagain that no animal hurt you unless you molested or frightened it, she\r\ncould not get over her instinctive horror. He did not like leaving her.\r\nShe cared little for the local society and with him away he realised\r\nthat life for her must be intolerably dull. But the Sultan was keenly\r\ninterested in natural history and was anxious that the museum should be\r\ncompletely representative of the country's fauna. One expedition Munro\r\nand Neil were to make together, so that Neil should learn how to go to\r\nwork, and the plans for this were discussed by them for months. Neil\r\nlooked forward to it as he had never looked forward to anything in his\r\nlife.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMeanwhile he learned Malay and acquired a smattering of the dialects\r\nthat would be useful to him on future journeys. He played tennis and\r\nfootball. He soon knew everyone in the community. On the football field\r\nhe threw off his absorption in science and his interest in Russian\r\nfiction and gave himself up to the pleasure of the game. He was strong,\r\nquick and active. After it was all over it was grand to have a sluice\r\ndown and a long tonic with a slice of lemon and go over it all with the\r\nother fellows. It had never been intended that Neil should live\r\npermanently with the Munros. There was a roomy rest-house at Kuala\r\nSolor, but the rule was that no one should stay in it for more than a\r\nfortnight and such of the bachelors as had no official quarters clubbed\r\ntogether and took a house between them. When Neil arrived it so happened\r\nthat there was no vacancy in any of these messes. One evening, however,\r\nwhen he had been about four months in the colony, two men, Waring and\r\nJonson, when they were sitting together after a game of tennis, told him\r\nthat one member of their mess was going home and if he would like to\r\njoin them they would be glad to have him. They were young fellows of his\r\nown age, in the football team, and Neil liked them both. Waring was in\r\nthe Customs and Jonson in the police. He jumped at the suggestion. They\r\ntold him how much it would cost and fixed a day, a fortnight later, when\r\nit would be convenient for him to move in.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt dinner he told the Munros.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It's been awfully good of you to let me stay so long. It's made me very\r\nuncomfortable planting myself on you like this, I've been quite ashamed,\r\nbut now there's no excuse for me.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"But we like having you here,\" said Darya. \"You don't need an excuse.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I can hardly go on staying here indefinitely.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Why not? Your salary's miserable, what's the use of wasting it on board\r\nand lodging? You'd be bored stiff with Jonson and Waring. Stupids. They\r\nhaven't an idea in their heads outside playing the gramophone and\r\nknocking balls about.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was true that it had been very convenient to live free of cost. He\r\nhad saved the greater part of his salary. He had a thrifty soul and had\r\nnever been used to spending money when it wasn't necessary, but he was\r\nproud. He could not go on living at other people's expense. Darya looked\r\nat him with her quiet, observant eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Angus and I have got used to you now. I think we'd miss you. If you\r\nlike, you can pay us for your board. You don't cost anything, but if\r\nit'll make you easier I'll find out exactly what difference you make in\r\ncookie's book and you can pay that.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It must be an awful nuisance having a stranger in the house,\" he\r\nanswered uncertainly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It'll be miserable for you there. Good heavens, the filth they eat.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was true also that at the Munros' you ate better than anywhere else\r\nat Kuala Solor. He had dined out now and then, and even at the\r\nResident's you didn't get a very good dinner. Darya liked her food and\r\nkept the cook up to the mark. He made Russian dishes which were a fair\r\ntreat. That cabbage soup of Darya's was worth walking five miles for.\r\nBut Munro hadn't said anything.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'd be glad if you'd stay here,\" he said now. \"It's very convenient to\r\nhave you on the spot. If anything comes up we can talk it over there and\r\nthen. Waring and Jonson are very good fellows, but I dare say you'd find\r\nthem rather limited after a bit.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, well, then I'll be very pleased. Heaven knows, I couldn't want\r\nanything better than this. I was only afraid I was in the way.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNext day it was raining cats and dogs and it was impossible to play\r\ntennis or football, but towards six Neil put on a mackintosh and went to\r\nthe club. It was empty but for the Resident, who was sitting in an\r\narm-chair reading <i>The Fortnightly</i>. His name was Trevelyan, and he\r\nclaimed to be related to the friend of Byron. He was a tall fat man,\r\nwith close-cropped white hair and the large red face of a comic actor.\r\nHe was fond of amateur theatricals and specialised in cynical dukes and\r\nfacetious butlers. He was a bachelor, but generally supposed to be fond\r\nof the girls, and he liked his gin pahit before dinner. He owed his\r\nposition to the Sultan's friendship. He was a slack, complacent man, a\r\ngreat talker, not very fond of work, who wanted everything to go\r\nsmoothly and no one to give trouble. Though not considered especially\r\ncompetent he was popular in the community because he was easy-going and\r\nhospitable, and he certainly made life more comfortable than if he had\r\nbeen energetic and efficient. He nodded to Neil.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well, young fellow, how are bugs to-day?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Feeling the weather, sir,\" said Neil gravely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Hi-hi.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn a few minutes Waring, Jonson and another man, called Bishop, came in.\r\nHe was in the Civil Service. Neil did not play bridge, so Bishop went up\r\nto the Resident.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Would you care to make a fourth, sir?\" he asked him. \"There's nobody\r\nmuch in the club to-day.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Resident gave the others a glance.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"All right. I'll just finish this article and join you. Cut for me and\r\ndeal. I shall only be five minutes.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil went up to the three men.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, I say, Waring, thanks awfully, but I can't move over to you after\r\nall. The Munros have asked me to stay on with them for good.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA broad smile broke on Waring's face.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Fancy that.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It's awfully nice of them, isn't it? They made rather a point of it. I\r\ncouldn't very well refuse.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What did I tell you?\" said Bishop.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't blame the boy,\" said Waring.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was something in their manner that Neil did not like. They seemed\r\nto be amused. He flushed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\" he cried.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, come off it,\" said Bishop. \"We know our Darya. You're not the first\r\ngood-looking young fellow she's had a romp with, and you won't be the\r\nlast.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before Neil's clenched fist shot\r\nout like a flash. He hit Bishop on the face and he fell heavily to the\r\nfloor. Jonson sprang at Neil and seized him round the middle, for he was\r\nbeside himself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Let me go,\" he shouted. \"If he doesn't withdraw that I'll kill him.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Resident, startled by the commotion, looked up and rose to his feet.\r\nHe walked heavily towards them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What's this? What's this? What the hell are you boys playing at?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey were taken aback. They had forgotten him. He was their master.\r\nJonson let go of Neil and Bishop picked himself up. The Resident, a\r\nfrown on his face, spoke to Neil sharply.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What's the meaning of this? Did you hit Bishop?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"He made a foul suggestion reflecting on a woman's honour,\" said Neil,\r\nvery haughtily, and still white with rage.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Resident's eyes twinkled, but he kept a grave face.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What woman?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I refuse to answer,\" said Neil, throwing back his head and drawing\r\nhimself up to his full imposing height.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt would have been more effective if the Resident hadn't been a good two\r\ninches taller, and very much stouter.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Don't be a damned young fool.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Darya Munro,\" said Jonson.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What did you say, Bishop?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I forget the exact words I used. I said she'd hopped into bed with a\r\ngood many young chaps here, and I supposed she hadn't missed the chance\r\nof doing the same with MacAdam.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It was a most offensive suggestion. Will you be so good as to apologise\r\nand shake hands. Both of you.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I've had a hell of a biff, sir. My eye's going to look like the devil.\r\nI'm damned if I apologise for telling the truth.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You're old enough to know that the fact that your statement is true\r\nonly makes it more offensive, and as far as your eye is concerned I'm\r\ntold that a raw beef-steak is very efficacious in these circumstances.\r\nThough I put my desire that you should apologise in the form of a\r\nrequest out of politeness, it is in point of fact an order.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was a moment's silence. The Resident looked bland.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I apologise for what I said, sir,\" Bishop said sulkily.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Now then, MacAdam.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'm sorry I hit him, sir. I apologise, too.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Shake hands.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe two young men solemnly did so.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I shouldn't like this to go any further. It wouldn't be very nice for\r\nMunro, whom I think we all like. Can I count on you all holding your\r\ntongues?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey nodded.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Now be off with you. You stay, MacAdam, I want to have a few words with\r\nyou.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the two of them were left alone, the Resident sat down and lit\r\nhimself a cheroot. He offered one to Neil, but he only smoked\r\ncigarettes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You're a very violent young man,\" said the Resident, with a smile. \"I\r\ndon't like my officers to make scenes in a public place like this.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Mrs. Munro is a great friend of mine. She's been kindness itself to me.\r\nI won't hear a word said against her.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Then I'm afraid you'll have your job cut out for you if you stay here\r\nmuch longer.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil was silent for a moment. He stood, tall and slim, before the\r\nResident, and his grave young face was guileless. He flung back his head\r\ndefiantly. His emotion made him speak in broader Scots even than usual.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I've lived with the Munros for four months, and I give you my word of\r\nhonour that so far as I am concerned there is not an iota of truth in\r\nwhat that beast said. Mrs. Munro has never treated me with anything that\r\nyou could call undue familiarity. She's never by word or deed given me\r\nthe smallest hint that she had an improper idea in her head. She's been\r\nlike a mother to me or an elder sister.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Resident watched him with ironical eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'm very glad to hear it. That's the best thing I've heard about her\r\nfor a long time.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You believe me, sir, don't you?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Of course. Perhaps you've reformed her.\" He called out. \"Boy. Bring me\r\na gin pahit.\" And then to Neil. \"That'll do. You can go now if you want\r\nto. But no more fighting, mind you, or you'll get the order of the\r\nboot.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen Neil walked back to the Munros' bungalow the rain had stopped and\r\nthe velvet sky was bright with stars. In the garden the fire-flies were\r\nflitting here and there. From the earth rose a scented warmth and you\r\nfelt that if you stopped you would hear the growth of that luxuriant\r\nvegetation. A white flower of the night gave forth an overwhelming\r\nperfume. In the verandah Munro was typing some notes and Darya, lying at\r\nfull length on a long chair, was reading. The lamp behind her lit her\r\nsmoky hair so that it shone like an aureole. She looked up at Neil and,\r\nputting down her book, smiled. Her smile was very friendly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Where have you been, Neil?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"At the club.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Anybody there?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe scene was so cosy and domestic, Darya's manner so peaceful and\r\nquietly assured, that it was impossible not to be touched. The two of\r\nthem there, each occupied with his own concerns, seemed so united, their\r\nintimacy so natural, that no one could have conceived that they were not\r\nperfectly happy in one another. Neil did not believe a single word of\r\nwhat Bishop had said and the Resident had hinted. It was incredible.\r\nAfter all, he knew that what they had suspected of <i>him</i> was untrue, so\r\nwhat reason was there to think that the rest was any truer? They had\r\ndirty minds, all those people; because they were a lot of swine they\r\nthought everyone else as bad as they were. His knuckle hurt him a\r\nlittle. He was glad he had hit Bishop. He wished he knew who had started\r\nthat filthy story. He'd wring his neck.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut now Munro fixed a date for the expedition that they had so much\r\ndiscussed, and in his careful way began to make preparations so that at\r\nthe last moment nothing should be forgotten. The plan was to go as far\r\nup the river as possible and then make their way through the jungle and\r\nhunt for specimens on the little-known Mount Hitam. They expected to be\r\naway two months. As the day on which they were to start grew nearer\r\nMunro's spirits rose, and though he did not say very much, though he\r\nremained quiet and self-controlled, you could tell by the light in his\r\neyes and the jauntiness of his step how much he looked forward to it.\r\nOne morning, at the museum, he was almost sprightly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I've got some good news for you,\" he said suddenly to Neil, after they\r\nhad been looking at some experiments they were making, \"Darya's coming\r\nwith us.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Is she? That's grand.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil was delighted. That made it perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It's the first time I've ever been able to induce her to accompany me.\r\nI told her she'd enjoy it, but she would never listen to me. Queer\r\ncattle, women. I'd given it up and never thought of asking her to come\r\nthis time, and suddenly, last night, out of a blue sky she said she'd\r\nlike to.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'm awfully glad,\" said Neil.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I didn't much like the idea of leaving her by herself so long; now we\r\ncan stay just as long as we want to.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey started early one morning in four prahus, manned by Malays, and\r\nbesides themselves the party consisted of their servants and four Dyak\r\nhunters. The three of them lay on cushions side by side, under an\r\nawning; in the other boats were the Chinese servants and the Dyaks. They\r\ncarried bags of rice for the whole party, provisions for themselves,\r\nclothes, books and all that was necessary for their work. It was\r\nheavenly to leave civilisation behind them and they were all excited.\r\nThey talked. They smoked. They read. The motion of the river was\r\nexquisitely soothing. They lunched on a grassy bank. Dusk fell and they\r\nmoored for the night. They slept at a long house and their Dyak hosts\r\ncelebrated their visit with arrack, eloquence and a fantastic dance.\r\nNext day the river, narrowing, gave them more definitely the feeling\r\nthat they were adventuring into the unknown, and the exotic vegetation\r\nthat crowded the banks to the water's edge, like an excited mob pushed\r\nfrom behind by a multitude, caused Neil a breathless ravishment. O\r\nwonder and delight! On the third day, because the water was shallower\r\nand the stream more rapid, they changed into lighter boats, and soon it\r\ngrew so strong that the boatmen could paddle no longer, and they poled\r\nagainst the current with powerful and magnificent gestures. Now and then\r\nthey came to rapids and had to disembark, unload and haul the boats\r\nthrough a rock-strewn passage. After five days they reached a point\r\nbeyond which they could go no further. There was a government bungalow\r\nthere, and they settled in for a couple of nights while Munro made\r\narrangements for their excursion into the interior. He wanted bearers\r\nfor their baggage, and men to build a house for them when they reached\r\nMount Hitam. It was necessary for Munro to see the headman of a village\r\nin the vicinity and thinking it would save time if he went himself\r\nrather than let the headman come to him, the day after they arrived he\r\nset out at dawn with a guide and a couple of Dyaks. He expected to be\r\nback in a few hours. When he had seen him off Neil thought he would have\r\na bathe. There was a pool a little way from the bungalow, and the water\r\nwas so clear that you saw every grain of the sandy bottom. The river was\r\nso narrow there that the trees over-arched it. It was a lovely spot. It\r\nreminded Neil of the pools in Scotch streams he had bathed in as a boy,\r\nand yet it was strangely different. It had an air of romance, a feeling\r\nof virgin nature, that filled him with sensations that he found hard to\r\nanalyse. He tried, of course, but older heads than his have found it\r\ndifficult to anatomise happiness. A kingfisher was sitting on an\r\noverhanging branch and its vivid blue was reflected as bluely in the\r\ncrystal stream. It flew away with a flashing glitter of jewelled wings\r\nwhen Neil, slipping off his sarong and baju, scrambled down into the\r\nwater. It was fresh without being cold. He splashed and tumbled about.\r\nHe enjoyed the movement of his strong limbs. He floated and looked at\r\nthe blue sky peeping through the leaves and the sun that here and there\r\ngilded the water. Suddenly he heard a voice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"How white your body is, Neil.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith a gasp he let himself sink and turning round saw Darya standing on\r\nthe bank.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I say, I haven't got any clothes on.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"So I saw. It's much nicer bathing without. Wait a minute, I'll come in,\r\nit looks lovely.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe also was wearing a sarong and a baju. He turned away his head\r\nquickly, for he saw that she was taking them off. He heard her splash\r\ninto the water. He gave two or three strokes in order that she should\r\nhave room to swim about at a good distance from him, but she swam up to\r\nhim.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Isn't the feel of the water on one's body lovely?\" she said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe laughed and opening her hand splashed water in his face. He was so\r\nembarrassed he did not know which way to look. In that limpid water it\r\nwas impossible not to see that she was stark naked. It was not so bad\r\nnow, but he could not help thinking how difficult it would be to get\r\nout. She seemed to be having a grand time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't care if I do get my hair wet,\" she said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe turned over on her back and with strong strokes swam round the pool.\r\nWhen she wanted to get out, he thought, the best thing would be if he\r\nturned his back and when she was dressed she could go and he would get\r\nout later. She seemed quite unconscious of the awkwardness of the\r\nsituation. He was vexed with her. It really was rather tactless to\r\nbehave like that. She kept on talking to him just as if they were on dry\r\nland and properly dressed. She even called his attention to herself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Does my hair look awful? It's so fine it gets like rat tails when it's\r\nwet. Hold me under the shoulders a moment while I try to screw it up.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, it's all right,\" he said. \"You'd better leave it now.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'm getting frightfully hungry,\" she said presently. \"What about\r\nbreakfast?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"If you'll get out first and put on your things, I'll follow you in a\r\nminute.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"All right.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe swam the two strokes needed to bring her to the side, and he\r\nmodestly looked away so that he should not see her get out nude from the\r\nwater.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I can't get up,\" she cried. \"You'll have to help me.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt had been easy enough to get in, but the bank overhung the water and\r\none had to lift oneself up by the branch of a tree.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I can't. I haven't got a stitch of clothing on.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I know that. Don't be so Scotch. Get up on the bank and give me a\r\nhand.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere was no help for it. Neil swung himself up and pulled her after\r\nhim. She had left her sarong beside his. She took it up unconcernedly\r\nand began to dry herself with it. There was nothing for him but to do\r\nthe same, but for decency's sake he turned his back on her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You really have a most lovely skin,\" she said. \"It's as smooth and\r\nwhite as a woman's. It's funny on such a manly virile figure. And you\r\nhaven't got a hair on your chest.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil wrapped the sarong round him and slipped his arms into the baju.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Are you ready?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe had porridge for breakfast, and eggs and bacon, cold meat and\r\nmarmalade. Neil was a trifle sulky. She was really almost too Russian.\r\nIt was stupid of her to behave like that; of course there was no harm in\r\nit, but it was just that sort of thing that made people think the things\r\nthey did about her. The worst of it was that you couldn't give her a\r\nhint. She'd only laugh at you. But the fact was that if any of those men\r\nat Kuala Solor had seen them bathing like that together, stark naked,\r\nnothing would have persuaded them that something improper hadn't\r\nhappened. In his judicious way Neil admitted to himself that you could\r\nhardly blame them. It was too bad of her. She had no right to put a\r\nfellow in such a position. He had felt such a fool. And say what you\r\nliked, it was indecent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNext morning, having seen their carriers on the way, a long procession\r\nin single file, each man carrying his load in a creel on his back, with\r\ntheir servants, guides and hunters, they started to walk. The path ran\r\nover the foothills of the mountain, through scrub and tall grass, and\r\nnow and then they came to narrow streams which they crossed by rickety\r\nbridges of bamboo. The sun beat on them fiercely. In the afternoon they\r\nreached the shade of a bamboo forest, grateful after the glare, and the\r\nbamboos in their slender elegance rose to incredible heights, and the\r\ngreen light was like the light under the sea. At last they reached the\r\nprimeval forest, huge trees swathed in luxuriant creepers, an\r\ninextricable tangle, and awe descended upon them. They cut their way\r\nthrough the undergrowth. They walked in twilight and only now and then\r\ncaught through the dense foliage above them a glimpse of sunshine. They\r\nsaw neither man nor beast, for the denizens of the jungle are shy and at\r\nthe first sound of footsteps vanish from sight. They heard birds up high\r\nin the tall trees, but saw none save the twittering sunbirds that flew\r\nin the underwoods and delicately coquetted with the wild flowers. They\r\nhalted for the night. The carriers made a floor of branches and on this\r\nspread water-proof sheets. The Chinese cook made them their dinner and\r\nthen they turned in.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was the first night Neil had ever spent in the jungle and he could\r\nnot sleep. The darkness was profound. The noise was deafening of\r\ninnumerable insects, but like the roar of traffic in a great city it was\r\nso constant that in a little while it was like an impenetrable silence,\r\nand when on a sudden he heard the shriek of a monkey seized by a snake\r\nor the scream of a night-bird he nearly jumped out of his skin. He had a\r\nmysterious sensation that all around creatures were watching them. Over\r\nthere, beyond the camp-fires, savage warfare was waged and they three on\r\ntheir bed of branches were defenceless and alone in face of the horror\r\nof nature. By his side Munro was breathing quietly in his deep sleep.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Are you awake, Neil?\" Darya whispered.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Yes. Is anything the matter?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'm terrified.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It's all right. There's nothing to be afraid of.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"The silence is so awful. I wish I hadn't come.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe lit a cigarette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil, having at last dozed off, was awakened by the hammering of a\r\nwoodpecker, and its complacent laugh as it flew from one tree to another\r\nseemed to mock the sluggards. A hurried breakfast, and the caravan\r\nstarted. The gibbons swung from branch to branch, gathering in the dawn\r\ndew from the leaves, and their strange cry was like the call of a bird.\r\nThe light had driven away Darya's fears, and notwithstanding a sleepless\r\nnight she was alert and gay. They continued to climb. In the afternoon\r\nthey reached the spot that the guides had told them would be a good\r\ncamping place, and here Munro decided to build a house. The man set to\r\nwork. With their long knives they cut palm leaves and saplings and soon\r\nhad erected a two-roomed hut raised on piles from the ground. It was\r\nneat and fresh and green. It smelt good.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Munros, he from old habit, she because she had for years wandered\r\nabout the world and had a catlike knack of making herself comfortable\r\nwherever she went, were at home anywhere. In a day they had arranged\r\neverything and settled down. Their routine was invariable. Every morning\r\nearly Neil and Munro started out separately, collecting. The afternoon\r\nwas devoted to pinning insects in boxes, placing butterflies between\r\nsheets of paper and skinning birds. When dusk came they caught moths.\r\nDarya busied herself with the hut and the servants, sewed and read and\r\nsmoked innumerable cigarettes. The days passed very pleasantly,\r\nmonotonous but eventful. Neil was enraptured. He explored the mountain\r\nin all directions. One day, to his pride, he found a new species of\r\nstick-insect. Munro named it Cuniculina MacAdami. This was fame. Neil\r\n(at twenty-two) realised that he had not lived in vain. But another day\r\nhe only just escaped being bitten by a viper. Owing to its green colour\r\nhe had not seen it and was only saved from lurching against it by the\r\nDyak hunter who was with him. They killed it and brought it back to\r\ncamp. Darya shuddered at the sight of it. She had a terror of the wild\r\ncreatures of the jungle that was almost hysterical. She would never go\r\nmore than a few yards from the camp for fear of being lost.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Has Angus ever told you how he was lost?\" she asked Neil one evening\r\nwhen they were sitting quietly together after dinner.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It wasn't a very pleasant experience,\" he smiled.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Tell him, Angus.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe hesitated a little. It was not a thing he liked to recall.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It was some years ago, I'd gone out with my butterfly net and I'd been\r\nvery lucky, I'd got several rare specimens that I'd been looking for a\r\nlong time. After a while I thought I was getting hungry so I turned\r\nback. I walked for some time and it struck me I'd come a good deal\r\nfarther than I knew. Suddenly I caught sight of an empty match-box. I'd\r\nthrown it away when I started to come back; I'd been walking in a circle\r\nand was exactly where I was an hour before. I was not pleased. But I had\r\na look round and set off again. It was fearfully hot and I was simply\r\ndripping with sweat. I knew more or less the direction the camp was in\r\nand I looked about for traces of my passage to see if I had come that\r\nway. I thought I found one or two and went on hopefully. I was\r\nfrightfully thirsty. I walked on and on, picking my way over snags and\r\ntrailing plants, and suddenly I knew I was lost. I couldn't have gone so\r\nfar in the right direction without hitting the camp. I can tell you I\r\nwas startled. I knew I must keep my head, so I sat down and thought the\r\nsituation over. I was tortured by thirst. It was long past midday and in\r\nthree or four hours it would be dark. I didn't like the idea of spending\r\na night in the jungle at all. The only thing I could think of was to try\r\nand find a stream; if I followed its course, it would eventually bring\r\nme to a larger stream and sooner or later to the river. But of course it\r\nmight take a couple of days. I cursed myself for being such a fool, but\r\nthere was nothing better to do and I began walking. At all events if I\r\nfound a stream I should be able to get a drink. I couldn't find a\r\ntrickle of water anywhere, not the smallest brook that might lead to\r\nsomething like a stream. I began to be alarmed. I saw myself wandering\r\non till at last I fell exhausted. I knew there was a lot of game in the\r\nforest and if I came upon a rhino I was done for. The maddening thing\r\nwas I knew I couldn't be more than ten miles from my camp. I forced\r\nmyself to keep my head. The day was waning and in the depths of the\r\njungle it was growing dark already. If I'd brought a gun I could have\r\nfired it. In the camp they must have realised I was lost and would be\r\nlooking for me. The undergrowth was so thick that I couldn't see six\r\nfeet into it and presently, I don't know if it was nerves or not, I had\r\nthe sensation that some animal was walking stealthily beside me. I\r\nstopped and it stopped too. I went on and it went on. I couldn't see it.\r\nI could see no movement in the undergrowth. I didn't even hear the\r\nbreaking of a twig or the brushing of a body through leaves, but I knew\r\nhow silently those beasts could move, and I was positive something was\r\nstalking me. My heart beat so violently against my ribs that I thought\r\nit would break. I was scared out of my wits. It was only by the exercise\r\nof all the self-control I had that I prevented myself from breaking into\r\na run. I knew if I did that I was lost. I should be tripped up before I\r\nhad gone twenty yards by a tangled root and when I was down it would\r\nspring on me. And if I started to run God knew where I should get to.\r\nAnd I had to husband my strength. I felt very like crying. And that\r\nintolerable thirst. I've never been so frightened in my life. Believe\r\nme, if I'd had a revolver I think I'd have blown my brains out. It was\r\nso awful I just wanted to finish with it. I was so exhausted I could\r\nhardly stagger. If I had an enemy who'd done me a deadly injury I\r\nwouldn't wish him the agony I endured then. Suddenly I heard two shots.\r\nMy heart stood still. They were looking for me. Then I did lose my head.\r\nI ran in the direction of the sound, screaming at the top of my voice, I\r\nfell, I picked myself up again, I ran on, I shouted till I thought my\r\nlungs would burst, there was another shot, nearer, I shouted again, I\r\nheard answering shouts; there was a scramble of men in the undergrowth.\r\nIn a minute I was surrounded by Dyak hunters. They wrung and kissed my\r\nhands. They laughed and cried. I very nearly cried too. I was down and\r\nout, but they gave me a drink. We were only three miles from the camp.\r\nIt was pitch dark when we got back. By God, it was a near thing.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA convulsive shudder passed through Darya.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Believe me, I don't want to be lost in the jungle again.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What would have happened if you hadn't been found?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I can tell you. I should have gone mad. If I hadn't been stung by a\r\nsnake or attacked by a rhino I should have gone on blindly till I fell\r\nexhausted. I should have starved to death. I should have died of thirst.\r\nWild beasts would have eaten my body and ants cleaned my bones.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSilence fell upon them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen it happened, when they had spent nearly a month on Mount Hitam,\r\nthat Neil, notwithstanding the quinine Munro had made him take\r\nregularly, was stricken with fever. It was not a bad attack, but he felt\r\nvery sorry for himself and was obliged to stay in bed. Darya nursed him.\r\nHe was ashamed to give her so much trouble, but she would not listen to\r\nhis protests. She was certainly very capable. He resigned himself to\r\nletting her do things for him that one of the Chinese boys could have\r\ndone just as well. He was touched. She waited on him hand and foot. But\r\nwhen the fever was at its height and she sponged him all over with cold\r\nwater, though the comfort was indescribable, he was excessively\r\nembarrassed. She insisted on washing him night and morning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I wasn't in the British hospital at Yokohama for six months without\r\nlearning at least the routine of nursing,\" she said, smiling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe kissed him on the lips each time after she had finished. It was\r\nfriendly and sweet of her. He rather liked it, but attached no\r\nimportance to it; he even went so far, a rare thing for him, as to be\r\nfacetious on the subject.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Did you always kiss your patients at the hospital?\" he asked her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Don't you like me to kiss you?\" she smiled.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It doesn't do me any harm.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It may even hasten your recovery,\" she mocked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne night he dreamt of her. He awoke with a start. He was sweating\r\nprofusely. The relief was wonderful, and he knew that his temperature\r\nhad fallen; he was well. He did not care. For what he had dreamt filled\r\nhim with shame. He was horrified. That he should have such thoughts,\r\neven in his sleep, made him feel awful. He must be a monster of\r\ndepravity. Day was breaking, and he heard Munro getting up in the room\r\nnext door that he occupied with Darya. She slept late, and he took care\r\nnot to disturb her. When he passed through Neil's room, Neil in a low\r\nvoice called him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Hullo, are you awake?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Yes, I've had the crisis. I'm all right now.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Good. You'd better stay in bed to-day. To-morrow you'll be as fit as a\r\nfiddle.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Send Ah Tan to me when you've had your breakfast, will you?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Right-ho.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe heard Munro start out. The Chinese boy came and asked him what he\r\nwanted. An hour later Darya awoke. She came in to bid him good-morning.\r\nHe could hardly look at her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'll just have my breakfast and then I'll come in and wash you,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'm washed. I got Ah Tan to do it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I wanted to spare you the trouble.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It isn't a trouble. I like doing it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe came over to the bed and bent down to kiss him, but he turned away\r\nhis head.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, don't,\" he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It's silly.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe looked at him for a moment, surprised, and then with a slight shrug\r\nof the shoulders left him. A little later she came back to see if there\r\nwas anything he wanted. He pretended to be asleep. She very gently\r\nstroked his cheek.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"For God's sake don't do that,\" he cried.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I thought you were sleeping. What's the matter with you to-day?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Why are you being horrid to me? Have I done anything to offend you?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"No.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Tell me what it is.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe sat down on the bed and took his hand. He turned his face to the\r\nwall. He was so ashamed he could hardly speak.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You seem to forget I'm a man. You treat me as if I was a boy of\r\ntwelve.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was blushing furiously. He was angry with himself and vexed with her.\r\nShe really should be more tactful. He plucked nervously at the sheet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I know it means nothing to you and it ought not to mean anything to me.\r\nIt doesn't when I'm well and up and about. One can't help one's dreams,\r\nbut they are an indication of what is going on in the subconscious.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Have you been dreaming about me? Well, I don't think there's any harm\r\nin that.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe turned his head and looked at her. Her eyes were gleaming, but his\r\nwere sombre with remorse.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You don't know men,\" he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe gave a little burble of laughter. She bent down and threw her arms\r\nround his neck. She had nothing on but her sarong and baju.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You darling,\" she cried. \"Tell me, what did you dream?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was startled out of his wits. He pushed her violently aside.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What are you doing? You're crazy.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe jumped half out of bed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Don't you know that I'm madly in love with you?\" she said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What <i>are</i> you talking about?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe sat down on the side of the bed. He was frankly bewildered. She\r\nchuckled.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Why do you suppose I came up to this horrible place? To be with you,\r\nducky. Don't you know I'm scared stiff of the jungle? Even in here I'm\r\nfrightened there'll be snakes or scorpions or something. I adore you.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You have no right to speak to me like that,\" he said sternly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, don't be so prim,\" she smiled.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Let's get out of here.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe walked out on to the verandah and she followed him. He threw himself\r\ninto a chair. She knelt by his side and tried to take his hands, but he\r\nwithdrew them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I think you must be mad. I hope to God you don't mean what you say.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I do. Every word of it,\" she smiled.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt exasperated him that she seemed unconscious of the frightfulness of\r\nher confession.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Have you forgotten your husband?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, what does he matter?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Darya.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I can't be bothered about Angus now.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'm afraid you're a very wicked woman,\" he said slowly, a frown\r\ndarkening his smooth brow.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe giggled.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Because I've fallen in love with you? Darling, you shouldn't be so\r\nabsurdly good-looking.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"For God's sake don't laugh.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I can't help it; you're comic--but still adorable. I love your white\r\nskin and your shining curly hair. I love you because you're so prim and\r\nScotch and humourless. I love your strength. I love your youth.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHer eyes glowed and her breath came quickly. She stooped and kissed his\r\nnaked feet. He drew them away quickly, with a cry of protest, and in the\r\nagitation of his gesture nearly overthrew the rickety chair.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Woman, you're insane. Have you no shame?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"No.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What do you want of me?\" he asked fiercely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Love.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What sort of a man do you take me for?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"A man like any other,\" she replied calmly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Do you think after all that Angus Munro has done for me I could be such\r\na damned beast as to play about with his wife? I admire him more than\r\nany man I've ever known. He's grand. He's worth a dozen of me and you\r\nput together. I'd sooner kill myself than betray him. I don't know how\r\nyou can think me capable of such a dastardly act.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, my dear, don't talk such bilge. What harm is it going to do him?\r\nYou mustn't take that sort of thing so tragically. After all, life is\r\nvery short; we're fools if we don't take what pleasure we can out of\r\nit.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You can't make wrong right by talking about it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't know about that. I think that's a very controvertible\r\nstatement.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked at her with amazement. She was sitting at his feet, cool to\r\nall appearance and collected, and she seemed to be enjoying the\r\nsituation. She seemed quite unconscious of its seriousness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Do you know that I knocked a fellow down at the club because he made an\r\ninsulting remark about you?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Bishop.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Dirty dog. What did he say?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"He said you'd had affairs with men.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't know why people won't mind their own business. Anyhow, who\r\ncares what they say? I love you. I've never loved anyone like you. I'm\r\nabsolutely sick with love for you.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Be quiet. Be quiet.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Listen, to-night when Angus is asleep I'll slip into your room. He\r\nsleeps like a rock. There's no risk.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You mustn't do that.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"No, no, no.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was frightened out of his wits. Suddenly she sprang to her feet and\r\nwent into the house.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMunro came back at noon, and in the afternoon they busied themselves as\r\nusual. Darya, as she sometimes did, worked with them. She was in high\r\nspirits. She was so gay that Munro suggested that she was beginning to\r\nenjoy the life.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It's not so bad,\" she admitted. \"I'm feeling happy to-day.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe teased Neil. She seemed not to notice that he was silent and kept\r\nhis eyes averted from her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Neil's very quiet,\" said Munro. \"I suppose you're feeling a bit weak\r\nstill.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"No, I just don't feel very talkative.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was harassed. He was convinced that Darya was capable of anything. He\r\nremembered the hysterical frenzy of Nastasya Filipovna in <i>The Idiot</i>,\r\nand felt that she too could behave with that unfortunate lack of\r\nbalance. He had seen her more than once fly into a temper with one of\r\nthe Chinese servants and he knew how completely she could lose her\r\nself-control. Resistance only exasperated her. If she did not\r\nimmediately get what she wanted she would go almost insane with rage.\r\nFortunately she lost interest in a thing with the same suddenness with\r\nwhich she hankered for it, and if you could distract her attention for a\r\nminute she forgot all about it. It was in such situations that Neil had\r\nmost admired Munro's tact. He had often been slyly amused to see with\r\nwhat a pawky and yet tender cunning he appeased her feminine tantrums.\r\nIt was on Munro's account that Neil's indignation was so great. Munro\r\nwas a saint, and from what a state of humiliation and penury and random\r\nshifts had he not taken her to make her his wife! She owed everything to\r\nhim. His name protected her. She had respectability. The commonest\r\ngratitude should have made it impossible for her to harbour such\r\nthoughts as she had that morning expressed. It was all very well for men\r\nto make advances, that was what men did, but for women to do so was\r\ndisgusting. His modesty was outraged. The passion he had seen in her\r\nface, and the indelicacy of her gestures, scandalised him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe wondered whether she would really carry out her threat to come to his\r\nroom. He didn't think she would dare. But when night came and they all\r\nwent to bed, he was so terrified that he could not sleep. He lay there\r\nlistening anxiously. The silence was broken only by the repeated and\r\nmonotonous cry of an owl. Through the thin wall of woven palm leaves he\r\nheard Munro's steady breathing. Suddenly he was conscious that someone\r\nwas stealthily creeping into his room. He had already made up his mind\r\nwhat to do.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Is that you, Mr. Munro?\" he called in a loud voice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDarya stopped suddenly. Munro awoke.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"There's someone in my room. I thought it was you.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It's all right,\" said Darya. \"It's only me. I couldn't sleep, so I\r\nthought I'd go and smoke a cigarette on the verandah.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, is that all?\" said Munro. \"Don't catch cold.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe walked through Neil's room and out. He saw her light a cigarette.\r\nPresently she went back and he heard her get into bed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe did not see her next morning, for he started out collecting before\r\nshe was up, and he took care not to get in till he was pretty sure Munro\r\nalso would be back. He avoided being alone with her till it was dark and\r\nMunro went down for a few minutes to arrange the moth-traps.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Why did you wake Angus last night?\" she said in a low angry whisper.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders and going on with his work did not answer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Were you frightened?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I have a certain sense of decency.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, don't be such a prig.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'd rather be a prig than a dirty swine.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I hate you.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Then leave me alone.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe did not answer, but with her open hand smartly slapped his face. He\r\nflushed, but did not speak. Munro returned and they pretended to be\r\nintent on whatever they were doing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor the next few days Darya, except at meal-times and in the evenings,\r\nnever spoke to Neil. Without prearrangement they exerted themselves to\r\nconceal from Munro that their relations were strained. But the effort\r\nwith which Darya roused herself from a brooding silence would have been\r\nobvious to anyone more suspicious than Angus, and sometimes she could\r\nnot help herself from being a trifle sharp with Neil. She chaffed him,\r\nbut in her chaff was a sting. She knew how to wound and caught him on\r\nthe raw, but he took care not to let her see it. He had an inkling that\r\nthe good-humour he affected infuriated her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen, one day when Neil came back from collecting, though he had delayed\r\ntill the last possible minute before tiffin, he was surprised to find\r\nthat Munro had not yet returned. Darya was lying on a mattress on the\r\nverandah, sipping a gin pahit and smoking. She did not speak to him when\r\nhe passed through to wash. In a minute the Chinese boy came into his\r\nroom and told him that tiffin was ready. He walked out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Where's Mr. Munro?\" he asked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"He's not coming,\" said Darya. \"He sent a message to say that the place\r\nhe's at is so good he won't come down till night.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMunro had set out that morning for the summit of the mountain. The lower\r\nlevels had yielded poor results in the way of mammals, and Munro's idea\r\nwas, if he could find a good place higher up, with a supply of water, to\r\ntransfer the camp. Neil and Darya ate their meal in silence. After they\r\nhad finished he went into the house and came out again with his topee\r\nand his collecting gear. It was unusual for him to go out in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" she asked abruptly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Out.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't feel tired. I've got nothing much else to do this afternoon.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly she burst into tears.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"How can you be so unkind to me?\" she sobbed. \"Oh, it is cruel to treat\r\nme like this.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked down at her from his great height, his handsome, somewhat\r\nstolid face bearing a harassed look.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What have <i>I</i> done?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You've been beastly to me. Bad as I am I haven't deserved to suffer\r\nlike this. I've done everything in the world for you. Tell me one single\r\nlittle thing I could do that I haven't done gladly. I'm so terribly\r\nunhappy.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe moved on his feet uneasily. It was horrible to hear her say that. He\r\nloathed and feared her, but he had still the respect for her that he had\r\nalways felt, not only because she was a woman, but because she was Angus\r\nMunro's wife. She wept uncontrollably. Fortunately the Dyak hunters had\r\ngone that morning with Munro. There was no one about the camp but the\r\nthree Chinese servants and they, after tiffin, were asleep in their own\r\nquarters fifty yards away. They were alone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't want to make you unhappy. It's all so silly. It's absurd of a\r\nwoman like you to fall in love with a fellow like me. It makes me look\r\nsuch a fool. Haven't you got any self-control?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, God. Self-control!\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I mean, if you really cared for me you couldn't want me to be such a\r\ncad. Doesn't it mean anything to you that your husband trusts us\r\nimplicitly? The mere fact of his leaving us alone like this puts us on\r\nour honour. He's a man who would never hurt a fly. I should never\r\nrespect myself again if I betrayed his confidence.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe looked up suddenly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What makes you think he would never hurt a fly? Why, all those bottles\r\nand cases are full of the harmless animals he's killed.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"In the interests of science. That's quite another thing.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, you fool, you fool.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well, if I am a fool I can't help it. Why do you bother about me?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Do you think I wanted to fall in love with you?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Ashamed? How stupid! My God, what have I done that I should eat my\r\nheart out for such a pretentious ass?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You talk about what you've done for me. What has Munro done for you?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Munro bores me to death. I'm sick of him. Sick to death of him.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Then I'm not the first?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEver since her amazing avowal he had been tortured by the suspicion that\r\nwhat those men at Kuala Solor had said of her was true. He had refused\r\nto believe a word of it, and even now he could not bring himself to\r\nthink that she could be such a monster of depravity. It was frightful to\r\nthink that Angus Munro, so trusting and tender, should have lived in a\r\nfool's paradise. She could not be as bad as that. But she misunderstood\r\nhim. She smiled through her tears.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Of course not. How can you be so silly? Oh, darling, don't be so\r\ndesperately serious. I love you.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen it was true. He had sought to persuade himself that what she felt\r\nfor him was exceptional, a madness that together they could contend with\r\nand vanquish. But she was simply promiscuous.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Aren't you afraid Munro will find out?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe was not crying any more. She adored talking about herself, and she\r\nhad a feeling that she was inveigling Neil into a new interest in her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I sometimes wonder if he doesn't know, if not with his mind, then with\r\nhis heart. He's got the intuition of a woman and a woman's\r\nsensitiveness. Sometimes I've been certain he suspected and in his\r\nanguish I've sensed a strange, spiritual exaltation. I've wondered if in\r\nhis pain he didn't find an infinitely subtle pleasure. There are souls,\r\nyou know, that feel a voluptuous joy in laceration.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"How horrible!\" Neil had no patience with these conceits. \"The only\r\nexcuse for you is that you're insane.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe was now much more sure of herself. She gave him a bold look.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Don't you think I'm attractive? A good many men have. You must have had\r\ndozens of women in Scotland who weren't so well made as I am.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe looked down at her shapely, sensual figure with calm pride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I've never had a woman,\" he said gravely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe was so surprised that she sprang to her feet. He shrugged his\r\nshoulders. He could not bring himself to tell her how disgusting the\r\nidea of such a thing was to him, and how vile he had thought the\r\nhaphazard amours of his fellow-students at Edinburgh. He took a mystical\r\njoy in his purity. Love was sacred. The sexual act horrified him. Its\r\nexcuse was the procreation of children and its sanctification marriage.\r\nBut Darya, her whole body rigid, stared at him, panting; and suddenly,\r\nwith a sobbing cry in which there was exultation and at the same time\r\nwild desire, she flung herself on her knees and seizing his hand\r\npassionately kissed it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Alyosha,\" she gasped. \"Alyosha.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd then, crying and laughing, she crumpled up in a heap at his feet.\r\nStrange, hardly human sounds issued from her throat and convulsive\r\ntremors passed through her body so that you would have thought she was\r\nreceiving one electric shock after another. Neil did not know if it was\r\nan attack of hysteria or an epileptic fit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Stop it,\" he cried. \"Stop it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe took her up in his strong arms and laid her in the chair. But when he\r\ntried to leave her she would not let him. She flung her arms round his\r\nneck and held him. She covered his face with kisses. He struggled. He\r\nturned his face away. He put his hand between her face and his to\r\nprotect himself. Suddenly she dug her teeth into it. The pain was so\r\ngreat that, without thinking, he gave her a great swinging blow.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You devil,\" he cried.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHis violent gesture had forced her to release him. He held his hand and\r\nlooked at it. She had caught him by the fleshy part on the side and it\r\nwas bleeding. Her eyes blazed. She was feeling alert and active.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I've had enough of this. I'm going out,\" he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe sprang to her feet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'll come with you.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe put on his topee and, snatching up his collecting gear without a\r\nword, turned on his heel. With one stride he leaped down the three steps\r\nthat led from the floor of the house to the ground. She followed him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'm going into the jungle,\" he said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't care.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the ravening desire that possessed her she forgot her morbid fear of\r\nthe jungle. She recked nothing of snakes and wild beasts. She did not\r\nmind the branches that hit her face or the creepers that entangled her\r\nfeet. For a month Neil had explored all that part of the forest and he\r\nknew every yard of it. He told himself grimly that he'd teach her to\r\ncome with him. He forced his way through the undergrowth with rapid\r\nstrides; she followed him, stumbling but determined; he crashed on,\r\nblind with rage, and she crashed after him. She talked; he did not\r\nlisten to what she said. She besought him to have pity on her. She\r\nbemoaned her fate. She made herself humble. She wept and wrung her\r\nhands. She tried to cajole him. The words poured from her lips in an\r\nunceasing stream. She was like a mad woman. At last in a little clearing\r\nhe stopped suddenly and turning round faced her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"This is impossible,\" he cried. \"I'm fed up. When Angus comes back I\r\nmust tell him I've got to go. I shall go back to Kuala Solor to-morrow\r\nmorning and go home.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"He won't let you go, he wants you. He finds you invaluable.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I don't care. I'll fake up something.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe mistook her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Oh, you needn't be frightened, I shan't tell him the truth. You can\r\nbreak his heart if you want to; I'm not going to.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"You worship him, don't you? That dull, phlegmatic man.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"He's worth a hundred of you.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It would be rather funny if I told him you'd gone because I wouldn't\r\nyield to your advances.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe gave a slight start and looked at her to see if she was serious.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Don't be such a fool. You don't think he'd believe that, do you? He\r\nknows it would never occur to me.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Don't be too sure.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe had spoken carelessly, with no particular intention other than to\r\ncontinue the argument, but she saw that he was frightened and some\r\ninstinct of cruelty made her press the advantage.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Do you expect mercy from me? You've humiliated me beyond endurance.\r\nYou've treated me like dirt. I swear that if you make any suggestion of\r\ngoing I shall go straight to Angus and say that you took advantage of\r\nhis absence to try and assault me.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I can deny it. After all it's only your word against mine.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Yes, but my word'll count. I can prove what I say.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I bruise easily. I can show him the bruise where you struck me. And\r\nlook at your hand.\" He turned and gave it a sudden glance. \"How did\r\nthose teeth marks get there?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe stared at her stupidly. He had gone quite pale. How could he explain\r\nthat bruise and that scar? If he was forced to in self-defence he could\r\ntell the truth, but was it likely that Angus would believe it? He\r\nworshipped Darya. He would take her word against anyone's. What\r\nmonstrous ingratitude it would seem for all Munro's kindness and what\r\ntreachery in return for so much confidence! He would think him a filthy\r\nskunk and from his standpoint with justice. That was what shattered him,\r\nthe thought that Munro, for whom he would willingly have laid down his\r\nlife, should think ill of him. He was so unhappy that tears, unmanly\r\ntears that he hated, came to his eyes. Darya saw that he was broken. She\r\nexulted. She was paying him back for the misery he had made her suffer.\r\nShe held him now. He was in her power. She savoured her triumph and in\r\nthe midst of her anguish laughed in her heart because he was such a\r\nfool. At that moment she did not know whether she loved or despised him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Now will you be good?\" she said.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe gave a sob and blindly, with a sudden instinct of escape from that\r\nabominable woman, took to his heels and ran as hard as he could. He\r\nplunged through the jungle, like a wounded animal, not looking where he\r\nwas going, till he was out of breath. Then, panting, he stopped. He took\r\nout his handkerchief and wiped away the sweat that was pouring into his\r\neyes and blinding him. He was exhausted and he sat down to rest.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I must take care I don't get lost,\" he said to himself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat was the least of his troubles, but all the same he was glad that he\r\nhad a pocket compass, and he knew in which direction he must go. He\r\nheaved a deep sigh and rose wearily to his feet. He started walking. He\r\nwatched his way and with another part of his mind miserably asked\r\nhimself what he should do. He was convinced that Darya would do what she\r\nhad threatened. They were to be another three weeks in that accursed\r\nplace. He dared not go; he dared not stay. His mind was in a whirl. The\r\nonly thing was to get back to camp and think it out quietly. In about a\r\nquarter of an hour he came to a spot that he recognised. In an hour he\r\nwas back. He flung himself miserably into a chair. And it was Angus who\r\nfilled his thoughts. His heart bled for him. Neil saw now all sorts of\r\nthings that before had been dark to him. They were revealed to him in a\r\nflash of bitter insight. He knew why the women at Kuala Solor were so\r\nhostile to Darya and why they looked at Angus so strangely. They treated\r\nhim with a sort of affectionate levity. Neil thought it was because\r\nAngus was a man of science and so in their foolish eyes somewhat absurd.\r\nHe knew now it was because they were sorry for him and at the same time\r\nfound him ridiculous. Darya had made him the laughing-stock of the\r\ncommunity. If ever there was a man who hadn't deserved ill usage at a\r\nwoman's hands it was he. Suddenly Neil gasped and began to tremble all\r\nover. It had suddenly occurred to him that Darya did not know her way\r\nthrough the jungle; in his anguish he had hardly been conscious of where\r\nthey went. Supposing she could not find her way home? She would be\r\nterrified. He remembered the ghastly story Angus had told them of being\r\nlost in the forest. His first instinct was to go back and find her, and\r\nhe sprang to his feet. Then a fierce anger seized him. No, let her shift\r\nfor herself. She had gone of her own free will. Let her find her own way\r\nback. She was an abominable woman and deserved all that might come to\r\nher. Neil threw back his head defiantly, a frown of indignation on his\r\nsmooth young brow, and clenched his hands. Courage. He made up his mind.\r\nIt would be better for Angus if she never returned. He sat down and\r\nbegan trying to make a skin of a Mountain Trogon. But the Trogon has a\r\nskin like wet tissue-paper and his hands trembled. He tried to apply his\r\nmind to the work he was doing, but his thoughts fluttered desperately,\r\nlike moths in a trap, and he could not control them. What was happening\r\nover there in the jungle? What had she done when he suddenly bolted?\r\nEvery now and then, against his will, he looked up. At any moment she\r\nmight appear in the clearing and walk calmly up to the house. He was not\r\nto blame. It was the hand of God. He shuddered. Storm clouds were\r\ngathering in the sky and night fell quickly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJust after dusk Munro arrived.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Just in time,\" he said. \"There's going to be a hell of a storm.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was in great spirits. He had come upon a fine plateau, with lots of\r\nwater, from which there was a magnificent view to the sea. He had found\r\ntwo or three rare butterflies and a flying squirrel. He was full of\r\nplans to move the camp to this new place. All about it he had seen\r\nabundant evidence of animal life. Presently he went into the house to\r\ntake off his heavy walking boots. He came out at once.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Where's Darya?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil stiffened himself to behave with naturalness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Isn't she in her room?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"No. Perhaps she's gone down to the servants' quarters for something.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe walked down the steps and strolled a few yards.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Darya,\" he called. \"Darya.\" There was no answer. \"Boy.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA Chinese servant came running up and Angus asked him where his mistress\r\nwas. He did not know. He had not seen her since tiffin.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Where can she be?\" asked Munro, coming back, puzzled.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe went to the back of the house and shouted.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"She can't have gone out. There's nowhere to go. When did you see her\r\nlast, Neil?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"I went out collecting after tiffin. I'd had a rather unsatisfactory\r\nmorning and I thought I'd try my luck again.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Strange.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey hunted everywhere round the camp. Munro thought she might have made\r\nherself comfortable somewhere and gone to sleep.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It's too bad of her to frighten one like this.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe whole party joined in the search. Munro began to grow alarmed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"It's not possible that she should have gone for a stroll in the jungle\r\nand lost her way. She's never moved more than a hundred yards from the\r\nhouse to the best of my knowledge since we've been here.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil saw the fear in Munro's eyes and looked down.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"We'd better get everyone along and start hunting. There's one thing,\r\nshe can't be far. She knows that if you get lost the best thing is to\r\nstay where you are and wait for people to come and find you. She'll be\r\nscared out of her wits, poor thing.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe called out the Dyak hunters and told the Chinese servants to bring\r\nlanterns. He fired his gun as a signal. They separated into two parties,\r\none under Munro, the other under Neil, and went down the two rough paths\r\nthat in the course of the month they had made in their comings and\r\ngoings. It was arranged that whoever found Darya should fire three shots\r\nin quick succession. Neil walked with his face stern and set. His\r\nconscience was clear. He seemed to bear in his hands the decree of\r\nimmanent justice. He knew that Darya would never be found. The two\r\nparties met. It was not necessary to look at Munro's face. He was\r\ndistracted. Neil felt like a surgeon who is forced to perform a\r\ndangerous operation without assistance or appliances to save the life of\r\nsomeone he loves. It behoved him to be firm.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"She could never have got so far as this,\" said Munro. \"We must go back\r\nand beat the jungle within the radius of a mile from the house inch by\r\ninch. The only explanation is that she was frightened by something or\r\nfainted or was stung by a snake.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeil did not answer. They started out again and, making lines, combed\r\nthe undergrowth. They shouted. Every now and then they fired a gun and\r\nlistened for a faint call in answer. Birds of the night flew with a\r\nwhirring of wings, frightened, as they advanced with their lanterns; and\r\nnow and then they half saw, half guessed at an animal, deer, boar, or\r\nrhino, that fled at their approach. The storm broke suddenly. A great\r\nwind blew and then the lightning rent the darkness, like the scream of a\r\nwoman in pain, and the tortured flashes, quick, quick, one on the heels\r\nof the other, like demon dancers in a frantic reel, wriggled down the\r\nnight. The horror of the forest was revealed in an unearthly day. The\r\nthunder crashed down the sky in huge rollers, peal upon peal, like vast,\r\nprimeval waves dashing against the shores of eternity. That fearful din\r\nhurtled through space as though sound had size and weight. The rain\r\npelted in fierce torrents. Rocks and gigantic trees came tumbling down\r\nthe mountain. The tumult was awful. The Dyak hunters cowered, gibbering\r\nin terror of the angry spirits who spoke in the storm, but Munro urged\r\nthem on. The rain fell all night, with lightning and thunder, and did\r\nnot cease till dawn. Wet through and shivering they returned to the\r\ncamp. They were exhausted. When they had eaten Munro meant to resume the\r\ndesperate search. But he knew that it was hopeless. They would never see\r\nher alive again. He flung himself down wearily. His face was tired and\r\nwhite and anguished.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Poor child. Poor child.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>",
